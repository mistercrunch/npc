   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

 00.1 CONTACT INFORMATION AND MAIL DROP
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Wahoo, we now have a mail-drop, if you are outside of the U.S.A or
    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.

    Send all goodies to:

	    HWA NEWS
	    P.O BOX 44118
	    370 MAIN ST. NORTH
	    BRAMPTON, ONTARIO
	    CANADA
	    L6V 4H5

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour &lt;sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper

 03.0 l0pht releases AntiSniff - Press release
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
      For Immediate Release 

           L0pht Heavy Industries Releases a Public Beta of Its
          Revolutionary New AntiSniff Network Security Software 

      Boston, MA - July 22, 1999 - L0pht Heavy Industries, a world
      renowned computer security think tank, today announced the public
      beta release of its AntiSniff network security software, which can
      detect attackers surreptitiously monitoring a computer network. 

      "AntiSniff is a whole new breed of network security tool, designed to
      detect the attack patterns used in compromising a computer
      network, instead of merely being reactive to already known
      vulnerabilities.", said Dr. Mudge, Chief Scientist at L0pht Heavy
      Industries. 

      AntiSniff, which operates on both Windows NT and UNIX operating
      systems, will detect remote computers that are packet sniffing, that
      is, monitoring all network communications. 

      In a recent survey, three-quarters of U.S. corporations, government
      agencies, financial institutions and universities reported suffering
      financial losses due to computer security breaches. Some of these
      attacks have become quite famous, such as the successfull attacks
      against the Senate & FBI webservers. Other attacks, however, don't
      get any media attention, and are far worse than the defacement of a
      web site. These attacks involve the invasion of government and
      corporate secrets, and personal privacy. Many of these attacks rely
      on packet sniffing to penetrate deep into a computer network. 

      Network communication can be likened to large group of people
      standing together in a room and talking. When people talk to each
      other, others nearby have the ability to listen in. When computers
      communicate over networks, they normally only listen to
      communications destined to themselves. However, they also have
      the ability to enter promiscous mode, which allows them to listen to
      communications that are destined to other computers. 

      When an attacker successfully compromises a computer, they install
      what is known as a packet sniffer, a tool that puts the computer into
      promiscuous mode, thus allowing them to monitor and record all
      network communications. The private information they gather, such
      as account names, passwords, credit cards, and even e-mail, is then
      used to compromise other computers. This is how, from one weak
      computer in a computer network, many computers, and the
      information they contain can be compromised. Until now, it has been
      impossible for network administrators to remotely detect if computers
      were listening in on all network communications. 

      L0pht Heavy Industries' AntiSniff stops all this, by giving network
      administrators and information security professionals the ability to
      remotely detect computers that are packet sniffing, regardless of the
      operating system. Dr. Mudge explains, "AntiSniff works by running a
      number of non-intrusive tests, in a variety of fashions, which can
      determine whether or not a remote computer is listening in on all
      network communications. Now it is impossible for an attacker who is
      sniffing to hide." 

      Current network security tools, such as network scanners, work by
      probing machines for software that contains bugs or software that's
      misconfigured. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), work by finding
      malicious signatures in network traffic. AntiSniff, on the other hand,
      is the first of it's kind. It remotely detects the passive act of
      eavesdropping on network communications. It will even detect
      packet sniffers installed by a rogue insider who may have legitimate
      administrative access to a machine, but still should not be monitoring
      all network traffic. 

      The AntiSniff public beta is released for Windows NT, complete with a
      fully featured graphical interface, report generating tools, and alarm
      system. It is designed so that it can be used to quickly scan a
      network or scan continuously, triggering alarms when a "packet
      sniffing" machine is detected. 

      The beta version has been made available free to all who would like
      to try it out. L0pht hopes to have the commercial release ready
      within a few weeks. Retail and site license pricing have not yet been
      determined. 

      To further the research of the security community as a whole, as
      they have in previous products, L0pht will be releasing AntiSniff as a
      UNIX command-line tool, complete with full source code. 

      For more information please contact AntiSniff@l0pht.com. The free
      beta download and full documentation are available at

      Pixar Studios to remake Disney's Tron?
      By Richard Barry, ZDNet (UK)
      July 23, 1999 4:13 PM PT

      It set the scene for a generation of hi-tech sci-fi movies and, arguably, inspired some of the best
      films of the genre. Tron, the legendary Disney movie loved by the thirty-something generation, is
      rumored to be in the re-make room with some very serious backers, including Steve Jobs. 
      
      Jobs, on stage this week with the iBook, also has another day job, running Pixar Animation
      Studios (Nasdaq:PIXR), maker of "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life." According to one source,
      Pixar may be working on a remake of the classic '80s sci-fi film. 
      
      The source, who asked not to be identified, said Pixar is trying to decide whether to remake the
      original or create a sequel. It will begin work on the project once Toy Story II hits the theaters
      November 24. John Lasseter, Toy Story's director, will head the production. 
      
      Lending fuel to the rumor, Lasseter has gone on record crediting Tron as the driving inspiration
      behind Toy Story. He saw the film while working as an animator on Mickey's Christmas Carol
      and had two best friends on the production team. 
      
      "It [Tron] was the future. It was the potential I saw in computer animation," Lasseter said. 
      
      A spokesperson for Pixar in Richmond, Calif., said she was not aware of any Tron projects, but if
      it were to happen, it would likely be led by Disney. Disney owns 50 percent of Pixar. The
      company did not return calls by press time.

      Phil Loranger, division chief for information assurance with the US
      Army, speaks out about Def Con 

      Phil Loranger, the division chief for information assurance with the US Army,
      was interviewed by CyberCrime analyst Alex Wellen while at Def Con. Here are
      excerpts. 

      Why come to Def Con? "This is an important conference to anybody [who] attends. 
      It is a conference in which there is a lot of valuable and technical information
      exchanged. 


      "There is an opportunity to meet some of the folks on the dark side, if you will,
      to see some of their thinking. 

      "We've done this [for the] first time this year to put [on] a federal panel and get
      [a] frank and honest exchange. ... To get some feelings from what the industry
      considers to be some of the most elite people in the dark side of computer
      security, if you will. 

      "We were invited to do a presentation and to participate in a panel." 

      Do you use hackers to check out your systems, to verify your vulnerablities?
      "Hackers, by their very definition, are law breakers and criminals, and I don't see
      why they should be rewarded, especially using taxpayer dollars. 

      "We have very talented people who have never broken the law and have struggled
      very hard through [their] academic years; and those are the folks we want to bring
      onto the payroll. 

      "This is not to say that the people we are addressing here today at this conference
      are criminals. We are talking here in broad strokes saying that if you break into a
      system you're a criminal." 

      How have you been received by attendees?
      "I have been experiencing a very cordial interchange among the people we've met.
      Meet the [Fed] panel was a less regulated environment, if you will. I think that it was
      not as rowdy as I had imagined, and I was pleased about that. 

      "Isn't it wonderful that we're able to have conferences like this under our form of
      government that says it's OK to not agree with the people on the platform?" 

      Will you return to Def Con next year?
      "I see us reacting to invitations to these if there are more, absolutely. 


      "Where else can you come and have a member of the  White House National Security Counsel,
      a member of the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Investigation, and a member of the
      military department stand there and interface with what I guess is considered
      ... we're considered to be their targets
      and so forth."

     My First Def Con

      On finding decadence and dialogue in
      the desert
      By Kevin Poulsen  July 14, 1999 

      I'm wandering through the hall outside the main conference room at the Alexis Park
      Hotel, stepping gingerly over blue Ethernet cable while gripping a drink in
      one hand, a cigarette in the other. Las Vegas is a nexus of many vices, crammed
      into spurts of late-night binges and hangover mornings. 

      Last weekend it became an oasis of decadence and dialogue in a desert turned
      to mud by a freak thunderstorm. 

      It's the seventh annual Def Con, the computer underground convention: my first. 
      Around me, a chaotic bazaar shows hackers of all shapes and sizes crowding
      around tables stacked with underground publication, T-shirts, and chunks of
      technology begging to be taken apart and reassembled. The younger attendees are
      drowning in caffeinated drinks-- primarily Jolt cola, which was apparently stocked
      by the hotel especially for this occasion. 

      "How is publicly releasing a hacking tool different from giving out guns to children?"
      queries the voice behind the camera, aimed for a kill shot at my head. 

      Earlier in the day, The Cult of the Dead Cow made a flashy standing-room-only
      presentation of Back Orifice 2000 -- a  feature-packed but stealthy
      remote-control utility for Windows-- and  it's fast becoming a symbol for the
      conference. 

      I don't know how to answer a question comparing a computer program to a
      firearm, but when the voice rephrases, I offer my soundbite. 

      "Secrecy only helps the bad guys." 

      By my definition, everyone at Def Con is a good guy, except the handful of good
      gals. The thousands of hackers, security consultants, outlaws, and scenesters from
      around the world are laying bare their knowledge, and sometimes their flesh, to
      each other and to the roving (and steadily increasing) glass eyes of news
      organizations that they suspect just don't get it. 

      Even the cops tend towards openness, good-naturedly accepting their "I Am the
      Fed" T-shirts when sharp-eyed hackers pick them from the crowd.
      
      The Primo Stuff

      The Dead Cow was the star of the show, but other highlights included the premiere
      of a nine-minute teaser for Freedom Downtime, 2600 editor Emmanuel
      Goldstein's work-in-progress about the legal travails of imprisoned hacker Kevin
      Mitnick. 

      After seeing the trailer, Chaos Theory foresees Goldstein and his documentary
      appearing at Cannes. You heard it here first. 

      Austin Hill, president of Zero Knowledge Systems Inc., described the workings of his
      company's  much-anticipated Freedom Net, an elaborate system intended to cloak the
      online activities of privacy conscious netizens. 

      Hill wins my Golden Aphorism award (which I just invented) for his answer to law
      enforcement's complaints that Internet anonymity makes their job harder:
      "Policing is only easy in a police state." 
 
      Sessions at the conference covered public policy, tutorials on computer security and
      lock-picking, a plethora of technical discussions, and games, such as Hacker
      Jeopardy and a social engineering contest. 

      At night, hackers raved on the conference dance floor and partied in the suites. 

      And it's there, away from the rows of  Linux boxes and laptops, and beyond the
      reach of the blue cables, that the  excesses of the Def Con nightlife evoke a
      Hollywood party, circa 1985. Reclining next to the hot tub at a shindig in one of
      the more spacious suites-- a vice, once again, in each hand-- someone offers me
      a tiny Ziplock bag filled with white powder. 

      The illusion is dispelled when I read the warning label affixed to the bag. The
      powder is 100 percent pure caffeine. Primo stuff at the hacker con. 

      Editor's Note: Kevin Poulsen was a
      speaker at Def Con, and was on the team
      that won Hacker Jeopardy, which also
      included Jennifer Granick and Mark Lottor.

07.0 Y2K Situation in Europe
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/
     
     by BHZ, Friday 23rd July 1999 on 1:17 pm CET
     German Council of Trade and Industry published results of their testing about Y2K
     compliance in German companies. It looks like just 45 percent of companies are
     properly prepared for the new millennium. According to some IT professionals, year
     2000 will be a year of bankruptcies. Western European countries are prepared for
     Y2K, but there is always something to work around. Read the story on NY Times.

     Europe Rides Bumpy Computer Road to
     Year 2000

     By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

      HANOVER, Germany -- Perhaps fittingly, Germany's first real
     scare about Year 2000 computer crashes came on a Friday the 13th. 

     It was March 1998, and most people here were greeting warnings about
     Year 2000 failures with a lack of interest. It seemed like a trivial
     problem, a matter of making sure that computer clocks would not
     misread the year 2000 as 1900. 

     Then came the test at the Hanover city power company, organized by a
     confident data processing manager in the spirit of public education, with
     local media invited to watch. At first, everything seemed fine. But within a
     few minutes after "midnight," the computer began spewing out thousands
     of error messages. Then it froze up entirely, and the monitors went blank.


                                Hanover did not go dark. But for a
                                few minutes, it was impossible to
                                monitor the electric grid or to trace
                                equipment breakdowns. It took
                                seven months to eradicate all the
                                problems. 

                                "I really thought it would be fine," said
     Juergen Rehmer, the blue-jeans-clad manager who arranged the event.
     "We had made a lot of changes already, and I was quite certain that a
     full-system test wouldn't present any great difficulty." 

     Rehmer's test was a watershed. It disrupted a widespread complacency
     about Year 2000 problems, and marked the first time that a German
     power company had issued a warning. 

     At the time it occurred, the German government had yet to make its first
     assessment of the Year 2000 problem. Surveys by insurance companies
     showed that the vast majority of companies had not even begun to look
     at their systems. 

     "The European view is that Anglo-American countries
     are in kind of an hysterical mold," said Peter Eibert,
     the Year 2000 coordinator at Ford Motor Co. of
     Europe, based in Cologne. 

     Germany and many of Europe's most advanced
     countries are racing to make up for lost time.
     Corporations are pouring billions of dollars into
     reprogramming computers. Government agencies
     have set up hot lines. Industry associations hold
     countless conferences, often invoking the image of
     ticking time bomb. 

     They are making headway. Most experts are
     increasingly confident that Europe is not likely to see
     catastrophic failures. A Year 2000 trial involving
     Europe's major banks went smoothly. Airlines and
     airports, which recognized the danger long ago, say they are ready. 

     Nevertheless, many smaller companies and public institutions are running
     out of time. 

     In a recent survey, the German Council of Trade and Industry found that
     only 45 percent of companies were properly prepared. Hermes, a
     German insurance company in Hamburg, estimates that 60 percent of
     German companies still hadn't started a comprehensive program by last
     fall. 

     "We believe there will be a substantially higher rate of bankruptcies in the
     year 2000," said Walter Schmitt-Jamin, a managing director of Hermes.
     A doubling of the usual bankruptcy rate, slightly less than one percent of
     companies each year, is entirely possible, he added. 

     The readiness varies considerably across Western Europe. In Britain, the
     Netherlands and much of Scandinavia, governments and corporations
     jumped on the problem two years ago. 

     In Germany and France, government and business leaders were until
     recently more lackadaisical. Poorer countries like Italy, Spain and
     Portugal are struggling. 

     The formerly Communist nations of Central Europe and Russia are much
     more seriously behind. LOT, the Polish national airline, announced
     recently that it will ground about 70 flights on New Year's Eve out of
     concern about Year 2000 breakdowns. The Russian government
     recently reported that only one-third of the country's banks were ready. 

     Western European countries are well prepared in comparison. But they
     also have more to worry about. 

     The 15 nations of the European Union, 11 of which have now adopted
     the euro as a single currency, is an increasingly unified economy linked by
     dense information networks. 

     There is a boom in the construction of cross-border fiber-optic
     networks. Power companies buy and sell electricity over electronic
     trading systems. Car manufacturers order from suppliers over computer
     networks. 

     Yet when car manufacturers sent the worldwide suppliers detailed Year
     2000 questionnaires in early 1997, most of the responses provided little
     in the way of useful information. 

     That became a source of growing anxiety here in Germany over the next
     year. Executives at General Motors' Opel subsidiary were startled to
     discover that industrial robots they bought in 1997 still had Year 2000
     glitches. By August 1998, Opel had decided to start sending its own
     Year 2000 assessors on personal visits to key suppliers. 

     "The key was to ask questions that indicated whether the suppliers knew
     what they were talking about," said Roger Aze, Opel's Year 2000
     coordinator. "Do you have a person in charge of Y2K? Do you have a
     program and a schedule?" 

     In the last several months, Opel started sending technical experts to its
     most critical suppliers -- the ones whose own assembly lines are linked
     directly by computer network to those of Opel and that deliver on a "just
     in time" basis. 

     But Aze is still bracing for things outside their control: power disruptions
     or problems further down the supply chains. 

     Power remains one of the biggest concerns. "The energy industry had
     overslept," Rehmer said bluntly. It wasn't until July 1998 -- four months
     after Hanover's surprising test failure -- that the German Association of
     Electric Utilities advised members to "Start now!" on Year 2000
     preparation. 

     Today, Year 2000 experts in Germany say severe disruptions are
     unlikely but cannot be ruled out. As a result, many big industrial
     manufacturers are scaling back production to insulate themselves for a
     shock of an abrupt power disruption. 

     BASF AG, the chemical conglomerate based in Ludwigshafen, has
     decided to shut a number of its systems on New Year's Eve so it can get
     by on the electricity from its own on-site power plant. 

     So many manufacturers are reducing their power consumption on New
     Year's Eve that the utility industry has begun to worry about disruptions
     caused by an abrupt plunge in demand. 

     One of the key differences between European countries on Year 2000
     issues is the degree to which governments became involved. 

     In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair has built up a huge program to
     promote awareness and point companies toward solutions. Besides
     drumming up publicity, the government fielded several thousand "bug
     busters" to get out the word. 

     The Netherlands started a similar program, known as the Dutch
     Millennium Platform, headed by Jan Timmer, the former chairman of
     Philips Electronics NV. Timmer irked business groups by exhorting them
     to act, but most now experts rank the Netherlands alongside the United
     States and Britain as among the best-prepared countries. 

     By contrast, German leaders did not show much interest in the subject
     until a few months ago. The government issued a tepid report one year
     ago and a more thorough one this spring, and it only recently set up an
     Internet site devoted to the issue. 

     Local governments have largely been quiet on the matter. In March, the
     German weekly news magazine Focus published a survey indicating that
     most German cities had not yet prepared themselves for problems.
     According to the survey, carried out with the German Conference of
     Cities, half the cities had yet to test their hospitals, and one-third had not
     tested their mass transit systems. 

     The hospitals have had a rude awakening. Andreas Tecklenberg, director
     of a 260-bed hospital in the north German town of Eutin, was dismayed
     when only six out of 150 manufacturers gave him useful answers when he
     sent them queries about Year 2000 problems. 

     Since then, he has started to get better information. At the moment, he
     estimates, about one-third of the hospital's systems are "green" or ready;
     about one-third are yellow, and one-third still red. 

     "The devices will have to be watched," Tecklenberg said. "But
     fortunately, we can have people take over if equipment goes wrong." 

     At the German Heart Center in Berlin, which specializes in heart surgery,
     administrators are avoiding elective surgery between Christmas and
     January 3. It has also imposed a ban on holidays for most of the medical
     and technical staff on New Year's Eve. 

     "If you look at this from the American standpoint, we all started late
     here," acknowledged Marcus Werner, who coordinates the center's
     Year 2000 planning. 

     Werner started his preparations in October and said he was now
     reasonably confident about the hospital's medical equipment. 

     But like so many others, he worries about power. The hospital shares a
     back-up generator with the University of Berlin, but he is still worried
     about the software that will have to ration the relatively scarce electricity. 

     "What it comes down to is things you basically have no control over," he
     said.

      PROBLEM:  The current directory is in the root user's PATH
                after logging in using CDE.
      
      PLATFORM: HP 9000 series 700/800 at HP-UX revision 10.X
      
      DAMAGE:  Increase in privileges..
      
      SOLUTION: Modify /usr/dt/bin/Xsession until a patch is available.
      
      AVAILABILITY:  This advisory will be updated when patches are available.
      
      CHANGE SUMMARY: HTML to text conversion instructions for script added.
      
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      I.
         A. Background - The PATH environemnt variable is constructed from
            several sources including dtsearchpath and scripts in
            /etc/dt/config/Xsession.d/ and /usr/dt/config/Xsession.d/.
            The resulting PATH contains the string "::" which will be
            interpreted as the current directory.  The root user should
            not have the current directory in the PATH.
      
         B. Fixing the problem - Since the PATH environment variable can be
            affected by dtsearchpath and several scripts, the recommended
            solution is to clean up the root user's PATH after is has been
            created.
      
      **REVISED 01**
            Note:  This file is in HTML format.  If you are editing
            the text version from a mailing the line below:
      
                for (i=1; i<=n; i++) {
      
            must be changed.  Replace the characters between
            the second "i" and the "=n" with the single "less than"
            character (ascii 0x3c).
      
            The line will then read:
      
               for (i=1; iX=n; i++) {
               where X stands for the "less than" character.

      A vulnerability in one of the scripts used by the unix security tool
      Tiger has been discovered and a patch issued.
      
      Tiger is a public domain package developed and maintained by Texas A&M
      University, used for checking security problems on a Unix system.  Due
      to lack of checking, a local user can craft a command in such a way
      that he may have the command executed with the privileges of the
      process running Tiger (usually root).
      
      While no known compromises have occurred due to this vulnerability,
      it is recommended that the patch be applied if you run tiger.
      
      Patches for tiger have been issued and are available at
      ftp://net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TAMU/
      
      Thanks to Michel Miqueu and Philippe Bourgeois of CERT-IST for
      reporting the problem.

12.0  UPDATE ON THE PACKET STORM WEB SITE SITUATION
      ---------------------------------------------
      
      hey,
      
      i've been working very hard with numerous corporate entities
      to try to get the web site back up and online as soon as possible.
      
      everything is looking very good now, and i hope to have the site
      back up and better than ever RSN (Real Soon Now).  hopefully, the
      site will be run and hosted by a professional security firm (to be 
      named at the appropriate time), and the new site will be more 
      professionally maintained by a full staff of security experts, 
      administrators, and web designers.  with a very substantial amount
      of corporate funding, the new Packet Storm Security will be a 
      completely revamped site with more features, more updates, more
      bandwidth, more of everything.
      
      news and updates will be posted here as soon as i get confirmation
      of the new plans, and contracts are signed.

13.0 Piracy is Big Business for Some

      Churning out thousands of copies at a time for sale in
      the US and abroad, Southern California is now the home
      of the software counterfeiter.

      Who pays to arrest the pirates? Intel, Hewlett Packard,
      and others are funding public police forces. Evidently it
      is perfectly legal to grant local police departs hundreds
      of thousands of dollars so that they arrest the people
      you want them to. The police say there is no conflict of
      interest.

              Pirates of the High-Tech Age 
              
                 Southern California is now home to a sophisticated breed of criminals who,
              lured by high profits and low penalties, make and sell counterfeit computer
              software.
              By P.J. HUFFSTUTTER, TINI TRAN and DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer


          Southern California is becoming the national base for counterfeiters
           who make bogus software that looks so good even computer
           experts can't tell the difference.
           Once a problem confined to Asia and Latin America, high-quality fake
      CD-ROMs made here are showing up for sale in foreign countries, on
      Internet sites and even in some retail stores like Fry's Electronics.
      Authorities have seized nearly $200 million in counterfeit software in
      dozens of cases in Southern California over the past three years.
           The disks are manufactured by a new
      breed of multicultural gangs who operate
      somewhat like legitimate software
      companies. Lured by high profits and low
      penalties, these criminals work cooperatively
      with each other, often "outsourcing" different
      aspects of the operation to business partners
      in order to save time and money.
           "The irony of all this is the counterfeiters
      are mimicking us," said Chris Chapin,
      manager of intellectual property enforcement
      for video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc.
      in Redwood City. "They are our worst
      business rivals."
           Feeding off the nation's growing number
      of PC-owners, the counterfeiters are
      supplying consumers with hot new products such as video games, tax
      programs and business tools. Software pirates can replicate, for as little as
      50 cents, disks holding programs that computer companies price at
      hundreds of dollars.
           "Look, I can make more money off this than my lawyer can defending
      me," said one self-described pirate, nicknamed "hax3rz," who was selling
      illegal copies of top-selling video games on the Internet. "If they want it,
      I'll sell it."
           Southern California "is the capital for pirated [software] products in
      North America," said Nancy Anderson, senior attorney for Microsoft
      Corp.'s anti-piracy group. "Not Silicon Valley. Not New York. Not Texas.
      Not Washington. Here."
           High-tech piracy flourishes amid the anonymous industrial parks in the
      San Gabriel Valley cities of Walnut, Diamond Bar, City of Industry and
      Rowland Heights. Investigators have raided one business park in Walnut
      so many times that police have dubbed it "Pirates' Cove." But operations
      are also found elsewhere in the region.
           Earlier this year, in what industry experts describe as the nation's
      largest-ever software counterfeiting bust, Westminster police and the FBI
      arrested a dozen people and shut down an alleged piracy scheme with $60
      million worth of fake Microsoft software sitting on a warehouse floor in
      the city of Paramount.
                                    Atul Sowmitra Dhurandhar, a
                               51-year-old native of India, and his wife
                               were accused of money laundering and
                               running the operation that for four years
                               allegedly churned out counterfeit
                               CD-ROMs from plants in three
                               Southern California counties. They
                               pleaded not guilty, and their trial begins
                               in Los Angeles federal court this week.
                                    Like computer executives tapping
                               personal contacts for deals, Dhurandhar
      allegedly used friends to create a business network: a convicted Chinese
      counterfeiter, who obtained a commercial CD-ROM replicator to copy the
      disks; a Mexican national, who is allegedly a Mexicali state judicial police
      officer, to smuggle product across the border; and another Mexican to
      hire illegal immigrants to run the CD replicator.
           But even as police break up the operations, the software industry still
      cannot get the public to support its plight.
           There is little widespread sympathy
      when a corporation such as
      Microsoft--which is worth more than
      $500 billion--complains that it loses
      hundreds of millions of dollars a year to
      piracy.
           The wealthy upper class traditionally
      is seen by the masses as the enemy, said
      Robert Kelly, professor of society and
      criminal justice at the City University of
      New York. In the past, it was oil barons
      and railroad tycoons. Today, notes Kelly,
      Microsoft head Bill Gates is the bad guy.
           "Fake software is not seen as a
      threat to the public good," said Alfred
      Blumstein, a public policy professor at
      Carnegie Mellon University.
           Despite software companies
      aggressively lobbying politicians and
      spending millions of dollars on
      anti-piracy advertising campaigns, the
      laws remain relatively soft on
      counterfeiters. The result: people who
      pirate millions of dollars' worth of software often receive only probation.
           "It's cheap, it's easy and there's almost no risk," said Sgt. Marcus
      Frank of the Westminster Police Department, who lead the Dhurandhar
      investigation. "If you were a criminal, wouldn't you do it?"

           The Key to Success: Networking
           Frank said the Dhurandhar investigation peaked last fall, when
      undercover officers staked out warehouses in Paramount, watching as a
      stream of truck drivers loaded pallets stacked high with fake Microsoft
      goods.
                                           The ringleaders had
                                      allegedly been shipping an
                                      estimated 15,000 fake
                                      Microsoft disks a month
                                      nationwide and overseas. By
                                      early February, police and the
                                      FBI had enough evidence to
                                      get a search warrant and raid
                                      the operation.
                                           Officers burst inside a
                                      warehouse one rainy
                                      afternoon and surprised six
                                      immigrant workers, who were
                                      busy printing counterfeit
                                      Microsoft user manuals. Here
      and at nearby facilities, investigators found top-of-the-line CD-ROM
      duplication equipment, high-speed printing presses and rows of
      bookbinding and shrink-wrapping machines.
           Piles of phony warranty cards spilled out of nearby crates. Sixty
      million dollars' worth of boxed, shiny silver compact disks, all sporting the
      Microsoft logo, towered over the officers.
           And tucked off in a corner, police say, was the investigative mother
      lode: files stuffed with Dhurandhar's business documents and checkbooks.
      The paperwork mapped out an elaborate counterfeiting network,
      according to police, and gave investigators leads on the scheme's money
      trail.
           Dhurandhar, his wife Mamta--who faces the same charges as her
      husband--and their attorneys have declined to discuss the case. Ten other
      suspects will join them at trial this week.
           Prosecutors say the Dhurandhar case is a textbook example of a
      modern software counterfeiting operation, where professional networking
      is the key to success. Someone knows someone with the machinery to
      copy the disks. Someone else knows of a print-shop owner willing to
      churn out bogus user manuals.
           Police say the players in the Southland's growing software piracy
      industry range from legitimate shop owners to street thugs to U.S.-based
      Asian gangs, such as the Wah Ching and Black Dragons, to savvy
      businessmen of all nationalities willing to run a wide-scale operation.
           Instead of a crime "family" with workers of one ethnicity answering to
      a boss, these software gangs operate as independent agents with no
      specific loyalties. Where traditional crime outfits work to improve the
      power and dominance of their family, these alliances of counterfeiters end
      when the job is done.
           "If you're a Crip, you're always a Crip," said Det. Jess Bembry, an
      expert in Asian organized crime with the Los Angeles Police Dept. These
      cases are different because "if it benefits them [financially], warring
      groups will stop fighting to make money together."
           Like computer executives sealing million-dollar agreements with a
      handshake, the ancient Chinese rite of guanxi (pronounced gwan-shee) is
      the unspoken social glue that defines interactions in some Asian societies.
      For legitimate businessmen throughout the world, guanxi means a
      person's social rapport is his key currency in the corporate world.
           It also is a philosophy that, say police, allows accused software
      counterfeiters such as the Dhurandhars to build a large manufacturing
      enterprise.
           Dhurandhar allegedly used several of his businesses, including a Long
      Beach print shop called Digital Colors, as fronts for the secret operation.
      Heavily tinted windows shielded the workers and gave no clue as to what
      was being manufactured inside. By day, the firm was a legitimate printing
      business, according to court documents. By night, it allegedly was a
      full-scale counterfeiting and assembly plant.
           Digital Colors, according to police investigators and the documents
      they seized, was one hub in a manufacturing labyrinth. Companies in the
      San Gabriel Valley handled the assembly work. Distributors in Los
      Angeles and Westminster hawked the goods, which included French,
      Portuguese and English versions of such bestsellers as Windows 95 and
      Windows 98, Microsoft's computer operating systems.
           In Long Beach, Digital Colors made the boxes, which were stored in
      Paramount warehouses, one of which housed a $1.5-million CD-ROM
      replicator that is as big as a high school classroom.
           Finished products allegedly were boxed, shrink-wrapped and sold to
      mid-level distributors. They, in turn, sold the fakes to other software
      distributors. Some products were loaded on trucks and hauled across the
      country, say police. Other goods were taken to Los Angeles International
      Airport, flown to Northern California and later shipped overseas.
           Ultimately, the disks allegedly were hawked at swap meets, over the
      Internet and at small retail shops in the U.S., Canada, Europe and South
      America.
           How much money the counterfeiters actually made still is unclear, said
      assistant U.S. attorney Stephen Larson, 
           who is prosecuting the case.
           Court documents allege that the Dhurandhars used an elderly relative's
      bank account, and other accounts with Bank of America and Bank of
      Orange County, to launder at least $3.5 million in cash from sales of the
      fake software products.
           Profits allegedly were funneled into nearly $5 million worth of
      residential and commercial properties across Southern California, including
      a $2.7-million, Spanish-style home in Palos Verdes Estates perched above
      Lunada Bay, according to state property records and court documents.
      The Dhurandhars could step through their French doors and enjoy an
      expansive view of the ocean and Catalina Island.
           Federal and state authorities seized the properties and arrested the
      Dhurandhars in June at their home. Police say that Atul Dhurandhar was
      watering his lawn, and had $20,000 cash in his pocket, when they arrested
      him.
           A neighbor, when asked about the Dhurandhars, responded: "We
      never see them. They keep to themselves."

           Asian Economic Woes Intensify Piracy
           The piracy of intellectual property--whether software or music, film or
      pharmaceuticals--has flourished worldwide for decades. The rise of
      Southern California as a counterfeiting center is a more recent
      phenomenon.
           The other hotbed of software counterfeiting is Asia, where the threat
      of punishment is relatively low. In legitimate retail shops in Thailand last
      year, more than 80% of all computer software sold to consumers was
      pirated, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office.
           Last year's Asian economic collapse intensified piracy. Asian police
      and U.S. federal investigators say formerly legitimate optical disc
      producers--the companies that manufacture CD-ROMs for software
      firms in Asia--are now moonlighting as software counterfeiters.
           Among the offerings in Asian black markets: Microsoft's business
      software package, Office 2000 Premium, which retails for nearly $8,700
      in the United States. A week before Office 2000 debuted last month,
      shoppers who visited open-air markets in Hong Kong and Singapore
      picked up pirated versions for $20.
           Like their counterparts in the drug trade, software counterfeiters are
      well financed and mobile. When Hong Kong officials began cracking
      down on piracy in 1995, pirates relocated their manufacturing facilities to
      mainland China and nearby Macau, where there are fewer police
      agencies tracking copyright violators.
           Piracy also increased in Southern California. The U.S. Customs
      Department has tracked a steady increase in the value--and number--of
      high-tech counterfeit goods it seized this decade leaving the country.
      Although pirated movies and music get media attention, they made up only
      2% of all compact disks customs seized in the U.S. last year.
           Kathlene Karg, director of anti-piracy operations for the Interactive
      Digital Software Association, said pirates are attracted to the U.S. market
      because they can charge more.
           "That's why they're starting to make and distribute their stuff in the
      U.S. The risk might be greater, but so are the potential profits," she said.
           The fakes made here are harder to detect. For one thing, say
      manufacturers, they look great. Counterfeits sold overseas rarely come in
      anything more elaborate than a plastic sleeve.
           Americans, however, prefer to buy nicely packaged goods, and pirates
      can charge more if consumers are convinced they're buying
      authentic--though drastically discounted--software. Fake versions of
      Office 2000, similar to those selling for $20 in Singapore, can be found on
      at least one Internet site for $175. The difference? A user's manual, a
      warranty card and a shrink-wrapped box. All fake, of course.
           "Nearly everything [counterfeit] of ours that we're seeing being made
      in Southern California is retail-ready," said Anne Murphy, an attorney with
      Microsoft's anti-counterfeiting team. "That's a big threat to our business
      because people think they're buying the real thing."
           In fact, high-grade counterfeits are starting to show up in mainstream
      stores such as Fry's Electronics, industry sources say. The San Jose
      Police Department's high-tech crime unit in the past year has investigated
      several such cases.
           Police officers said that small batches of bogus goods, sold to the chain
      through independent distributors, had been discovered in inventory at
      various Fry's stores. Officials at San Jose-based Fry's declined to
      comment.
           Investigators won't say whether some consumers had bought fakes.
      Noting that investigations are ongoing, police also refused to identify the
      stores that carried the goods, or to disclose what kind of software was
      counterfeited.
           Even if the people who made the bogus product are caught, the
      consequences could be minor. But the downside for consumers could be
      serious.
           Counterfeit software could be a copy of an early--and flawed--version
      of the real thing. It could include viruses that could destroy a person's
      computer data. And manufacturers refuse to fix fake goods.
           Federal penalties for counterfeiting are relatively low. If convicted, a
      person can be sent to prison for up to five years for software
      counterfeiting. But most software pirates avoid serious punishment and
      usually serve less than three years, according to officials at the U.S.
      Attorney's office.
           Though a federal statute--the Digital Millennium Copyright
      Act--enacted late last year allows for more serious financial penalties and
      jail terms, the law remains relatively untested.
           To date, federal and local prosecutors have focused largely on those
      accused of running major counterfeiting operations and laundering money,
      such as the Dhurandhars. Federal money laundering charges have a much
      stronger legal bite--a minimum of 10 years in prison--than counterfeiting,
      said Assistant U.S. Attorney Larson, who is chief of the department's
      organized crime strike force in Los Angeles.
           "It takes me longer to build a case than the time they end up spending
      in jail," grumbled Det. Jess Bembry, an expert in Asian crime with the Los
      Angeles County Sheriff Department. "It's ridiculous."
           Few consumers sympathize when Microsoft or other large software
      firms complain about counterfeiters. The Redmond, Wash.-based
      behemoth is the world's most valuable corporation and has continually
      exceeded Wall Street's profit expectations. Last week, Microsoft said its
      fiscal fourth-quarter profits jumped 62%, with earnings for the period
      climbing to a record $2.2 billion.
           Microsoft has fought piracy since 1976, when Bill Gates wrote his
      now-famous "Homebrew" open letter to computer hobbyists. The missive
      chastised computer users and called them "thieves" for not paying to use
      the operating software, known as BASIC.
           Some critics say that software firms fuel piracy by charging too much
      for their products, but the companies argue that the prices are set to
      recoup costs of developing and marketing new programs and make a
      profit.
           "Counterfeiting is stealing. We don't benefit by it. We don't cause it,"
      said Murphy, the corporate attorney for Microsoft. 
           There are three categories of software piracy. "Warez" is the Internet
      underground community where users gather at little-known online trading
      posts to swap files. In license infringement piracy, an individual or
      organization loads a software program onto multiple computers and
      doesn't pay the manufacturer for each installation. Finally, there is
      counterfeiting--the practice of taking a program, burning a copy of it onto
      a disk and selling the CD-ROM for a profit.
           American willingness to buy counterfeit disks terrifies software firms,
      which have not convinced the public that downloading a $300 business
      computer program is as unethical as stealing a $300 leather coat.
           In fact, the lack of public outrage has so emboldened the criminal
      sector that consumers sometimes shop for counterfeit brands.
           Take, for example, the Players, a Malaysian crime syndicate known
      for making fake console video games. Their products, which are sold
      throughout Asia and on the Internet, sport a small "Players" logo on the
      jewel case. This logo also is burned on the game disk itself--often in place
      of the icon for Sony Corp., the legitimate game publisher.
           "When it comes to money, morality gets put aside," said Frank of the
      Westminster Police Department. "Welcome to the new age of
      international relations."

      Tech Firms Pay Police Agencies to Fight Cyber Crime 
      Law enforcement: Intel funds sheriff's unit that chases computer pirates.
      Some fear conflict of interest.
      By P.J. HUFFSTUTTER, Times Staff Writer

          Gander through the headquarters of the Sacramento County Sheriff
           Department's high-tech team and see what cops call the "ideal
           model" for fighting cyber crime in an age of shrinking budgets.
           Fluorescent lights cast a
      jaundiced pall over the worn
      office cubicles, the frayed
      fabric pinned in spots with
      tacks. On each desk sits a
      computer, confiscated from a
      crime scene and still sporting
      an evidence tag.
      Windbreakers with the team
      logo are a luxury.
           Then there are the things
      visitors don't see.
           Like the $10,000 body
      wire Intel Corp. bought for
      the unit to use in undercover
      stings. Or the corporate jet Hewlett-Packard Co. used to fly officers to
      Silicon Valley, and the tens of thousands of dollars the computer firm
      spent for the team's travel expenses--flights, hotels, meals--when a recent
      case took officers out of town.
           Tired of being ripped off by high-tech criminals, some of America's
      most powerful computer companies are fighting back with a relatively
      simple approach: Subsidize the local police.
           From inside pilferage and brazen heists to Internet piracy and industrial
      espionage, digital crime in the United States cost computer hardware and
      software companies about $3 billion last year.
           Authorities, who concede they are barely making a dent in the
      problem, insist they don't have the staff, resources or public support to
      tackle the overwhelming number of complaints.
           But the computer companies do. Corporate largess ranges from a
      $100,000 annual grant from Intel that pays for police salaries in Oregon to
      Motorola Corp. and several other major PC firms donating $10,000 each
      to an annual fund to help underwrite the Austin (Texas) Police
      Department's cyber team.
           This controversial practice has divided the law enforcement
      community between those who embrace the help and those who insist it is
      a means of buying justice.
           It also underscores a nationwide dilemma: How can local police
      departments protect the high-tech sector--and the jobs and tax revenue it
      provides--if there isn't enough money to handle such cases?
           While investigating the Hewlett-Packard case, members of the
      Sacramento Valley Hi-Tech task force traveled nationwide, at company
      expense, to serve search warrants, arrest suspects and confiscate
      evidence.
           Before federal criminal charges were filed, however, Hewlett-Packard
      filed a civil fraud suit against a company in San Diego believed to be tied
      to the $500-million scheme. Hewlett-Packard used evidence gathered, in
      part, in the officers' travels to resolve its suit and ultimately obtain a
      stipulated judgment in its favor for $900,000.
           "When companies are directly paying for travel, investigations or
      salaries, I think that's a very dangerous line that quickly crosses into a
      conflict of interest," said former FBI Agent Joe Chiaramonte, president of
      the San Jose chapter of the High Technology Crime Investigation Assn., a
      trade group.
           But police Sgt. Tom Robinson, who heads up the Hillsboro, Ore.,
      computer unit, sees it differently: "Frankly, any department that's not
      [accepting such grants] is missing the boat."
           Advocates such as Robinson insist the money represents the key to
      winning the war on cyber crime, and is a small investment for the
      multinational companies. 
           "If you're inferring that we're paid off, that's not right," said
      Sacramento County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Tsuchida. "I'll eat your dinner,
      sleep in your hotel and still arrest you if you're breaking the law."

           'We All Realized We Needed Each Other'
           Traditionally, many corporations have shied away from revealing too
      much to law enforcement to avoid drawing public attention to internal
      troubles. But as computer piracy grows, companies today are much more
      willing to seek help from police agencies. 
           Catching such criminals has long been the bailiwick of federal
      prosecutors, as tech-savvy criminals rarely stay within the neat confines
      of city limits when committing fraud on the Internet or stealing computer
      components.
           But federal law prevents prosecutors and the FBI from taking
      corporate contributions to pay for salaries or travel expenses, and limits
      the use of evidence collected by private investigators.
           State laws, however, have created a much broader gray area for local
      police. As a result, some local agencies rely on corporate handouts.
           When losses mounted from armed robberies at computer chip plants in
      Austin in the early '90s, the city's high-tech companies decided to finance
      a private nonprofit group to train officers to deal with the problem.
      Through the Austin Metro High Tech Foundation, firms including IBM
      and Dell Computer Corp. annually donate up to $10,000 each for
      investigators' training, travel and equipment.
           In return, businesses--including Applied Micro Devices, National
      Instruments and Motorola Corp.--say they expect law enforcement to
      treat computer crime as seriously as drugs and gang violence.
           Because Texas law restricts direct corporate contributions to
      particular police units, the funds are managed and distributed through the
      Austin Community Foundation, a nonprofit entity.
           "[The companies] can tell us what equipment we can or can't buy, but
      they can't tell us what to do with the cases," said Police Sgt. Robert
      Pulliam, who runs the department's five-person computer crime team.
      "We all realized we needed each other."
           This circle of financial interdependence has evolved slowly, from a
      long-standing tradition of police getting information from private
      investigators hired by the corporations.
           Companies typically approach police when they have enough evidence
      to back up a search warrant, said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty.
      William Clark, who prosecutes many trademark cases.
           Law enforcement then assembles the case. The corporate
      investigators often serve as experts, helping to identify fake products or
      explain the workings of stolen technology.
           Microsoft is the most aggressive technology firm when battling thieves,
      police say. In Hong Kong, the company runs its own stings, setting up
      fake storefronts as a means of gathering evidence, sources say.
           In the United States, Microsoft employs a security force of more than
      200 people, some of them former law enforcement officers, who
      investigate cases and package the evidence, which they hand over to
      authorities for prosecution.
           "As a matter of policy, we don't pay law enforcement to do their jobs,"
      said Anne Murphy, a corporate attorney with Microsoft's
      anti-counterfeiting group. "In certain cases, Microsoft has provided
      financial support for operating expenses for investigations."
           In 1997, the software giant approached the Los Angeles County
      Sheriff's Department and offered to help pay for a sting operation.
           The price? About $200,000 to purchase printing equipment from
      suspected software counterfeiters, and give officers the tools needed to
      create an undercover print shop.
           The department declined.
           "It's not about the money. It's about how the public perceives the
      money and how it's being used," said Det. Jess Bembry, who worked for
      the department's Asian Organized Crime unit at the time. "When defense
      attorneys start screaming, all anyone cares about is avoiding the
      perception of impropriety."
           The rich scent of wet soil and warm grass wafts across Hillsboro, a
      bedroom community of Portland, Ore., that has traded its agricultural roots
      for a future in high-tech manufacturing. This town of 68,000 more than
      doubles in population during weekdays, as workers flood into the
      catacomb of industrial facilities that have sprung up throughout the city's
      rolling hills.
           As Oregon's largest private employer, Intel's influence is pervasive. In
      blue-collar Hillsboro, it is difficult to distinguish the line between corporate
      philanthropy and corporate influence.
           At the Hillsboro Chamber of Commerce, a small plaque that reads
      "Intel Room" is affixed outside the door of the center's main meeting
      room--in honor of the company paying to furnish the small space.
           Though the town represents Oregon's largest high-tech hub, city
      managers have set aside only 2.7% of the Hillsboro Police Department's
      annual $9.2-million budget for its seven-person computer crime team.
           There's no need to commit more, city officials say, because Intel
      catches the shortfall: $100,000 a year, which pays the salary of one of the
      police officers and some expenses, according to a 1996 city memorandum
      of understanding obtained by The Times. Additionally, Intel purchased one
      officer's car, and helped pay for the team's offices, computer
      workstations, telephones and fax machines.
           Of all 231 cases Hillsboro's high-tech team has tackled between 1995
      and April 30 of this year, about 41% involve Intel in some way. As of
      April, about one-fifth of the nearly $210 million the unit recovered is tied
      to Intel complaints.
           Police say the grant, which is permitted by Oregon state law, has not
      swayed their focus. Investigators attribute the case ratio to black-market
      demand for fake Intel computer chips and the company's size.
           "This may not be the ideal way for us to do business, but at least we're
      trying to do something about these crimes," said Police Sgt. Robinson,
      whose team includes members of the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office.
      "Without us, the criminals run rampant and impact everyone--the
      companies and the community," he said.
           Intel executives insist that their "nontraditional approach" of working
      with police is legitimate and harmless. It is, they say, merely part of a
      companywide philosophy to invest in the communities where employees
      live and work--not a means of gaining police protection.
           "It'd be dead wrong to criticize the police unless we could make a
      contribution," said Chuck Mulloy, a corporate spokesman for Intel.
           Other cities are modeling their efforts after Hillsboro. Chandler, Ariz.,
      which has several Intel manufacturing and assembly centers, plans to
      pattern its own nascent computer team after Hillsboro.
           Such partnerships can hurt the police if companies stop paying, say
      critics. That's a concern in Hillsboro, where city officials admit there are
      no guarantees that the Intel grant won't disappear.
           "The police don't want to hear this, but if we lose the Intel grant, we'll
      default on the high-tech crime unit," said David Lawrence, Hillsboro's
      assistant city manager. "We'll have to go back to what we had before,
      which wasn't much."
           Inside a bland concrete warehouse on the edge of Sacramento's city
      limits, the Sacramento Valley Hi-Tech unit is the quintessential modern
      police model for fighting computer crime. The task force was created in
      1995 and draws officers from 16 enforcement agencies.
           The team's diverse membership--officers from different jurisdictions
      who possess varied skills--is the key to its strength.
           "These guys have the best reputation among law enforcement," said
      L.A. County Sheriff's Det. Bembry. "They do amazing things with very
      few financial resources."
           Each agency pays for its officers' salaries, equipment and vehicle. But
      the departments don't feed into the team's general operating budget, which
      is zero, said Sgt. Tsuchida, who runs the unit.
           By comparison, the department's narcotics team receives at least
      $55,000 a year for similar costs.
           "We serve at least 50 search warrants a year," Tsuchida said. "We
      couldn't get the $150 a person to get the training to make sure everyone
      does it the same way. That's a safety concern."
           The financial slack is often covered by local technology companies,
      which contribute seized assets and occasionally kick in for travel and
      other expenses, Tsuchida said. 
           "If the companies don't pay, we can't investigate" some out-of-town
      cases, said Sacramento County Sheriff's Lt. Jan Hoganson, who
      commands the unit. "We can't afford it."
           Cost was a factor in the recent Hewlett-Packard software theft case,
      which investigators say has links extending from the Central Valley to
      Southern California, the Pacific Northwest and Central America.
           Bill Conley, president of US Computer Corp. in Redmond, Wash., is
      one of several people Sacramento's unit arrested in conjunction with the
      case. The charges, of possessing stolen H-P goods, were later dropped,
      but Conley insists the case was tainted.
           "It was the Hewlett-Packard people--not the Redmond police, not the
      Sacramento cops--who led the whole thing, who took employees off and
      threatened to take them to jail," said Conley, 41.
           Police, prosecutors and Hewlett-Packard officials scoff at Conley's
      claim, and cite other types of white-collar crimes, such as insurance fraud,
      which routinely relies on the private sector for enforcement help. And
      Sacramento's Hoganson insists his team's focus is unbiased, they say,
      noting that of the 285 cases the team investigated in 1998, only 16 were
      tied to companies that are members of the unit's steering committee.
           But the California Supreme Court takes the issue seriously. In a 1996
      trade secrets case, the court upheld the disqualification of a Santa Cruz
      County district attorney because the office had accepted more than
      $13,000 from a Scotts Valley software company, Borland International.
           The money was used to hire a computer expert to determine whether
      a former executive had taken proprietary information to a rival firm,
      Symantec Corp.
           Police and prosecutors say the Hewlett-Packard case is different
      because the corporation's involvement did not influence their decision to
      file criminal charges.
           "I don't see [it] as a conflict, because you're giving law enforcement
      the money--not the district attorney's office," said Robert Morgester, a
      deputy attorney general for the state attorney general's office who helped
      create and fund the Sacramento team. 
           California legislators are trying to offset the money pinch, by rolling out
      a $1.3-million state grant to be divided among three task forces:
      Sacramento, San Jose and Los Angeles/Orange County. In addition, the
      governor's office has set aside an additional $1 million for the same
      purpose.
           Investigators say that although the grant helps, it's still not enough.
           "That money is already spent on training, hiring new people and getting
      my guys new computers," Tsuchida said. "We're not breaking any laws
      now, so why should we change what we're doing?"

     Study calls for reserve virtual IT warfare unit

     BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

     A year-long study completed last week by a senior panel of Defense
     Department officials recommended an unprecedented expansion in the role the
     reserves play in national defense, including the formation of a virtual
     cyberdefense unit to protect the nation's critical infrastructure.

     The study, Reserve Component Employment Study 2005, was initiated in April
     1998 at the request of Defense Secretary William Cohen and concluded that the
     reserves are "particularly well-suited to homeland defense missions." In addition,
     the study called for the formation of a "joint [reserve component] virtual
     information operations organization" and tasked various senior-level DOD
     organizations to complete a "proof of concept" study for creating the unit by
     June 30, 2000.

     The new reserve cyberdefense unit "would consist of individuals with
     information technology skills who could perform their duties from dispersed
     locations rather than working as a single consolidated unit at a specific training
     center," the report said. To accomplish their mission of protecting various critical
     infrastructure nodes, the unit would communicate from existing reserve centers
     and other DOD facilities across the country that have access to the Secret
     Internet Protocol Routing Network.

     To form the new unit, the study recommended looking for reserve members in
     regions of the country where high concentrations of IT skill already exist. 

     In addition, the study suggested that the reserves consider recruiting
     high-tech-savvy people from the civilian sector, requiring them to join the
     reserves for a specific number of years in exchange for high-tech training
     provided by DOD.

     Establishing a "virtual organization" also would go a long way toward solving the
     department's problem of retaining personnel with critical IT skills and may allow
     DOD to reduce its reliance on external contractor support, the report said. "A
     'virtual organization' [also] could support the Joint Task Force [for] Computer
     Network Defense," the report said. Cohen established the JTF-CND in
     December 1998 to monitor and take defensive actions against hackers and other
     unauthorized users who try to penetrate DOD networks.

     Rick Forno, a security officer for Network Solutions Inc. and the former senior
     security analyst at the House of Representatives' Information Resources
     Security Office, said the report's recommendation to use the reserves for cyber
     defense "is a great idea" and represents one of DOD's more innovative
     initiatives. "I'm thrilled that DOD is looking to go outside the box on the
     Info-Protect/InfoCorps idea in the reserve components," said Forno, who
     proposed a similar idea to DOD a year ago. However, "it comes down to
     endorsement and support from senior leadership [whether or not] they let this
     organization function as intended," he said.

     Anthony M. Valletta, vice president of C3I systems for SRA Federal Systems
     and former acting assistant secretary of Defense for command, control,
     communications and intelligence, said the concept of using the reserves in this
     manner is one that the intelligence community has proven works. 

     "When we did this with the intelligence community, it worked extremely well,"
     Valletta said. "We have a lot of expertise in the reserves that we need to take
     advantage of."

     The main challenge facing the reserve cyberdefense corps idea, according to
     Valletta, is training and equipping the reserves to carry out the mission. "We
     have to keep up with the technology, and the reserves have to have the latest
     capabilities," Valletta said. "That is a major change of philosophy in terms of
     equipping the reserves."

     However, the idea of establishing a JTF for Homeland Defense also is an idea
     that some groups, particularly civil liberties organizations, may question.

     "The main issue is the Posse Comitatus Act and the limits on military activity
     within the U.S.," said Mark Lowenthal, former deputy assistant secretary of
     State for intelligence and now a member of Valletta's C3I consulting team at
     SRA. "If it is limited to what are clearly DOD facilities, then there should be no
     problem," he said. "If it steps over that line, then there are some legal issues that
     have to be addressed."

     Other recommendations contained in the report include using the reserves as
     part of a Joint Task Force headquarters for Homeland Defense, which would
     work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other civil
     authorities to coordinate responses to attacks involving nuclear, chemical and
     biological weapons, and increasing the use of smart card technology to reduce
     delays in processing reserve members for active-duty assignments.

        Kodak Introduces CD-PROM, Claims to Thwart Pirates 


      contributed by WareZ dud3 
      Kodak has introduced a new CD technology it calls
      CD-PROM or CD-Programable Read Only Memory. It
      combines the standard CD with a small section of CDR
      that will contain specific information about the machine
      the software is registered to. Kodack claims this will
      stop piracy in its tracks. (It might stop the warez dudes
      from trading the latest version of Duke Nuke 'Em but it
      will do nothing to stop the professionals.)

      Kodak develops anti-hacker
      CD 
 
      Format is computer-specific, aims to foil
      non-customers 
 
      By Don Sheron
      EXPRES-NEWS SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY WRITER 
 
      Software pirates have a new technological hurdle ahead of
      them. Kodak has developed a way to make CD programs
      more secure from hackers and unlicensed users. 
 
      It's a customized CD called the CD-PROM (Compact
      Disc-Programmable ROM). This includes the standard
      write-once feature of commercial software, but the
      CD-PROM also includes a recordable feature that
      identifies a particular computer to the CD. 
 
      "There's a lot of enthusiasm for this technology," said Bruce
      Ha, senior research associate at the Eastman Kodak Co. of
      Rochester, N.Y. "It's a format that people have been
      talking about for the past 10 years now."
 
      The new hybrid technology allows software manufacturers
      to produce low-cost CD-ROMs with the ability to add
      CD-R (recordable) information. CD-PROM works like a
      normal CD software product, but using the software
      requires start-up information specific to the licensed
      consumer. 
 
      For instance, many software CDs require a registration
      code to unlock some or all of the program's features. To
      get the registration code, consumers can register their
      software online with the software manufacturer. To thwart
      Internet hackers, the CD-PROM will match the registration
      code with the licensed software, thus keeping hackers from
      using an illegal copy of the software.
 
      Similarly, a CD-PROM is designed to work on software
      shipped with a specific computer. The CD-PROM can be
      set up to read only the BIOS information on the computer
      with which it was shipped. The BIOS (basic input/output
      system) loads and executes the computer's operating
      system, such as Windows 98. 
 
      "So (Microsoft) Office or any other program that comes
      bundled with that computer cannot be shared by anyone
      else," Ha said.
 
      But making a CD-PROM has been difficult.
 
      A normal CD contains data embedded into "pits" that are
      pressed into the platter. The platter is then covered by an
      aluminum reflective layer and a protective plastic coating. 
 
      On a CD-R, a single groove is pressed into the platter
      instead of pits. An organic dye is added for recording new
      information onto the platter. A reflective layer of gold or
      silver covers the dye, and then the CD gets a protective
      coating.
 
      Some manufacturers have tried to add both pits and
      grooves onto a CD. But they have had problems with the
      disc being read properly. This can occur when the ROM
      reader switches to the recordable writer, or because the
      speed of the laser light reading the CD changes when it
      goes through different materials on the platter. 
 
      To get around this, Kodak decided to use a single,
      continuous groove pressed into the platter. The master disc
      is designed to make the CD reader think that the groove
      actually contains a series of pits. 
 
      Kodak is using the CD-PROM for its Picture CD product.
      Ha says no failures have been noticed after beta testing
      20,000 discs in photo labs.

      Most Significant Development in Wardialing Since the Movie "War Games"
    
      CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (BUSINESS WIRE) - Sandstorm Enterprises Inc., an information security tools company, has released an
      enhanced version of its PhoneSweep telephone scanner, incorporating "Single Call Detect" to dramatically speed scans. Additional
      features in PhoneSweep release 1.1 include an increase in the number of target systems recognized, to more than 200, and
      enhancements to the tool's brute force testing mode.
    
      PhoneSweep is intended for use by security professionals to audit corporate telephone systems for vulnerabilities, such as
      undocumented modems tied to internal networks. PhoneSweep works like a computer criminal's "war dialer," and Sandstorm has
      found an enthusiastic market for PhoneSweep among security professionals who had been using such "hackerware" for lack of a
      commercially-developed and supported alternative. "A surprising number of corporations, and even Federal agencies, have been
      using hacker tools like ToneLoc to carry out their telephone scans," said Dr. Ross Stapleton-Gray, Sandstorm's Vice President for
      Government Relations. "There's a certain irony -- and recklessness -- in relying upon unsupported, undocumented software to
      secure mission- or national security-critical networks."
    
      Single Call Detect allows PhoneSweep to determine if a telephone is answered with a voice, a second dial tone, a fax machine, or
      a data modem with a single call. The determination is made in less than five seconds, speeding the scanning process. "Dialing
      numbers and waiting for the modems to synchronize or time out, while simple, is neither efficient nor particularly effective," said
      James Van Bokkelen, Sandstorm's president. "Single Call Detect allows PhoneSweep to skip rapidly from number to number,
      ending a call as soon as a voice, busy or second dial tone is detected, and completing the average scan in less than half the time."
      The speed and accuracy afforded by Single Call Detect also reduces any inconvenience to organizations being scanned, as
      PhoneSweep promptly releases connections upon encountering a live or recorded voice.
    
      In developing PhoneSweep, Sandstorm worked with security expert Peter Shipley, who has scanned several million phone lines in
      the San Francisco Bay area. Shipley's research has shown unsecured "back doors" at hundreds of sites -- including government
      and commercial systems -- that allowed full control to any caller without first asking for a username and password. Sandstorm has
      used Shipley's results to train its recognition engine, and Shipley has used PhoneSweep's recognition system to categorize and
      tabulate the results of his project.
    
      Originally released last October, PhoneSweep is in use by both security departments and independent auditors at hundreds of sites
      in North America and overseas. PhoneSweep customers include both large and small companies, Federal and state governments
      and the military.
    
      PhoneSweep customers with current support contracts will all receive automatic upgrades to release 1.1. PhoneSweep Basic
      ($980) supports a single modem and up to 800 phone numbers per scanning profile. PhoneSweep Plus ($2800) supports four
      modems for simultaneous scanning, and 10,000 number profiles. PhoneSweep Plus8 ($5600) supports eight modems with 10,000
      number profiles. Sandstorm Enterprises will be exhibiting at the 8th USENIX Security Symposium, August 23-26 in Washington
      D.C.

                  threats such as Moonlight

      Russian hackers steal US weapons secrets 
     
                    by Matthew Campbell 
                        Washington
     AMERICAN officials believe Russia may have stolen some of
     the nation's most sensitive military secrets, including weapons
     guidance systems and naval intelligence codes, in a concerted
     espionage offensive that investigators have called operation
     Moonlight Maze. 
     
     The intelligence heist, that could cause damage to America in
     excess of that caused by Chinese espionage in nuclear
     laboratories, involved computer hacking over the past six
     months. 
     
     This was so sophisticated and well co-ordinated that security
     experts trying to build ramparts against further incursions
     believe America may be losing the world's first "cyber war". 
     
     Investigators suspect Russia is behind the series of "hits"
     against American computer systems since January. In one
     case, a technician trying to track a computer intruder watched
     in amazement as a secret document from a naval facility was
     "hijacked" to Moscow from under his nose. 
     
     American experts have long warned of a "digital Pearl Harbor"
     in which an enemy exploits America's reliance on computer
     technology to steal secrets or spread chaos as effectively as
     any attack using missiles and bombs. 
     
     In a secret briefing on Moonlight Maze, John Hamre, the
     deputy defence secretary, told a congressional committee: "We
     are in the middle of a cyber war." 
     
     Besides military computer systems, private research and
     development institutes have been plundered in the same
     operation. Such institutes are reluctant to discuss losses, which
     experts claim may amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. 
     
     "We're no longer dealing with a world of disgruntled
     teenagers," said a White House official, referring to previous
     cases of computer hacking in which pranksters have been
     found responsible for incursions. "It is impossible to overstate
     the seriousness of this problem. The president is very
     concerned about it." 
     
     The offensive began early this year, when a startling new
     method of hacking into American computer systems was
     detected. A military computer server near San Antonio, Texas,
     was "probed" for several days by hackers who had entered the
     system through an overseas site on the internet. 
     
     Dozens of infiltrations ensued at other military facilities and
     even at the Pentagon in Washington. When research
     laboratories also reported incursions using the internet
     technique, officials realised that a "cyber invasion" was under
     way. 
     
     "There were deliberate and highly co-ordinated attacks
     occurring in our defence department systems that appeared to
     be coming from one country," said Curt Weldon, chairman of a
     congressional committee for military research and
     development. "Such a thing has never happened before. It's
     very real and very alarming." 
     
     Even top secret military installations whose expertise is
     intelligence security have been breached. At the Space and
     Naval Warfare Systems Command (Spawar), a unit in San
     Diego, California, that specialises in safeguarding naval
     intelligence codes, Ron Broersma, an engineer, was alerted to
     the problem when a computer print job took an unusually long
     time. 
     
     To his amazement, monitoring tools showed that the file had
     been removed from the printing queue and transmitted to an
     internet server in Moscow before being sent back to San
     Diego. "It turned out to be a real tough problem for us," he told
     a private computer seminar last month. 
     
     It is not clear precisely what information was contained in the
     stolen document. Beyond its role in naval intelligence, Spawar
     is also responsible for providing electronic security systems for
     the Marine Corps and federal agencies. It is suspected that
     several other intrusions had gone undetected. 
     
     Oleg Kalugin, a former head of Soviet counterintelligence now
     resident in Maryland, said such facilities were prime targets for
     Russian intelligence. He said the Federal Agency for
     Government Communications and Information, a former KGB
     unit that specialises in electronic eavesdropping, was certain to
     be exploiting the internet for spying on America. "That's what
     they're good at," he said. 
     
     America's high-precision technologies, including weapons
     guidance systems, are of particular interest to a country such
     as Russia where economic woes have prompted crippling
     cutbacks in funding for military research. "Russia is quite good
     at producing technology but can't afford to finance the
     research," said Kalugin. "It's easier to steal it." 
     
     The computer assaults have given fresh impetus to measures
     ordered by Clinton more than a year ago to protect the
     country's electronic infrastructure. Alerted to the threat of
     Moonlight Maze, the president has called for an extra $600m to
     help fund a variety of initiatives, including an infrastructure
     protection centre in the FBI to gauge the vulnerability of
     computer systems to attack. 
     
     He has ordered the military to develop its own information
     warfare capabilities to respond to such attacks. But Weldon,
     describing dependence on computer systems as "the Achilles
     heel of developed nations", said this is not enough. He is
     advocating the creation of a unit in the Pentagon under a senior
     commander to oversee the defence of computer systems. 
     
     According to other experts, America has been so preoccupied
     with beating the Y2K (year 2000) or millennium bug - a
     programming problem that could paralyse computers on the
     first stroke of the new year - that its military, scientific and
     commercial communities have neglected the overall security of
     their computer systems. 
     
     At the same time, the huge number of systems being
     overhauled to make them Y2K-compliant has heightened the
     risk of infiltration. 
     
     Alarmed by the theft of military documents whisked to Russia,
     American officials argue that the country should brace itself
     for other, equally disturbing forms of information warfare that,
     in theory, could bring the country to its knees. 
     
     China, Libya and Iraq are developing information warfare
     capabilities and, according to one White House official, "we
     see well-funded terrorist groups that also have such
     capabilities". 
     
     A series of war games conducted by experts last year
     revealed that the world's greatest superpower could be at the
     mercy of a handful of determined computer hackers paralysing
     airports, markets and military systems with a few taps on a
     computer laptop. 
     
     Suspicions that Russia is responsible are based partly on the
     involvement of Moscow-based internet servers in some
     attacks. But experts caution that evidence of a Russian hand in
     the operation may not signal a Kremlin connection. 
     
     "It could turn out to be Russian organised crime," said one
     expert. "And they could be acting as a front for the intelligence
     community." 
     
     Ironically, the Russians are pressing for an international treaty
     to freeze information warfare. "We cannot permit the
     emergence of a fundamentally new area of international
     confrontation," Sergei Ivanov, the former Russian foreign
     minister, wrote in a letter to Kofi Annan, the United Nations
     secretary-general in October. 
     
     Subsequently, Russia's relations with America have reached
     their lowest ebb since the cold war because of Nato's
     intervention in Yugoslavia. Relations with China have also
     suffered. An offensive in cyberspace may be their one way of
     retaliating without getting into a shooting war.

      US losing cyber war to Russian hackers
      From MATTHEW CAMPBELL of The Sunday Times in Washington
    
      26jul99
    
      US officials believe Russia may have stolen some of Washington's most
      sensitive military secrets, including weapons guidance systems and
      naval intelligence codes, in an espionage offensive that investigators
      have called Operation Moonlight Maze. 
    
      The intelligence action, whose damage to the US could exceed that
      caused by Chinese espionage in nuclear laboratories, involved computer
      hacking in the past six months. 
    
      The operations were so sophisticated that security experts trying to
      build defences against further incursions believe the US may be losing
      the world's first cyber war. 
    
      Investigators suspect Russia is behind the series of hits against US
      computer systems since January. In one case, a US technician trying to
      track a computer intruder watched in amazement as a secret document
      from a naval facility was hijacked to Moscow from under his nose. 
    
      In a secret briefing on Moonlight Maze, deputy Defence Secretary John
      Hamre told a congressional committee: "We are in the middle of a cyber
      war." 
    
      Besides military computer systems, private research and development
      institutes have been plundered, US officials say. Such institutes are
      reluctant to discuss losses, which experts claim amount to hundreds of
      millions of dollars. 
    
      "It is impossible to overstate the seriousness of this problem. The
      President is very concerned about it," a White House official said. 
    
      The offensive began early this year, when a startling new method of
      hacking into US computer systems was detected. 
    
      A military computer server near San Antonio, Texas, was infiltrated for
      several days by hackers who had entered the system, through an
      overseas site on the Internet. 
    
      Dozens of security violations ensued at other military facilities, and
      even at the Pentagon, the US military headquarters in Washington.
      When research laboratories also reported Internet incursions, officials
      realised a cyber invasion was under way. 
    
      "There were deliberate and highly co-ordinated attacks occurring in our
      defence department systems that appeared to be coming from one
      country," said Curt Weldon, chairman of the congressional committee
      for military research and development. 
    
      "Such a thing has never happened before. It's very real and very
      alarming." 
    
      Even top-secret military installations, whose expertise is intelligence
      security, have been breached. 
    
      At the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command in San Diego,
      California, which specialises in safeguarding naval intelligence codes,
      engineer Ron Broersma was alerted to the operation when a computer
      print-out took an unusually long time. 
    
      To his amazement, monitoring checks showed the top-secret file had
      been removed from the printing queue and transmitted to an Internet
      server in Moscow before being sent back to San Diego. 
    
      Alerted to the threat of Moonlight Maze, President Bill Clinton has called
      for an extra $US600 million ($923 million) to fund a variety of security
      initiatives, including an infrastructure protection centre in the FBI to
      gauge the vulnerability of computer systems. 
    
      The White House has ordered the US military to develop its own
      information warfare capabilities. US officials warn other forms of
      electronic attack could potentially bring the country's military to its
      knees. 
    
      China, Libya and Iraq are developing information warfare capabilities.
      And one White House official says: "We see well-funded terrorist groups
      that also have such capabilities."

     Virus identity beginning to blur
     By Jim Louderback, ZDTV
     July 23, 1999 10:49 AM PT
     URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2300632,00.html
     
     So what is, or what is not a virus? That question took an interesting turn last week. 
     
     The kind folks over at Cult of the Dead Cow launched a counter-attack at Microsoft. Their new
     Back Orifice product, which allows remote monitoring and administration of computers over a LAN
     or the Internet, has come under fire from many quarters. Because after a surreptitious install it is
     virtually undetectable by the end user, many are calling it a Trojan Horse. 
     
     But a Trojan Horse is actually a program that calls itself one thing, but turns out to be something
     else. Unless a hacker or cracker developed a seemingly benign program that secretly installed Back
     Orifice's Server, it's just a program that does some powerful and possibly nasty things. 
     
     But Microsoft and others have been bashing Back Orifice. Symantec included Back Orifice server
     detection in their Anti-Virus product. And up on Microsoft's security site, they're calling Back
     Orifice 'malicious' -- primarily because it "Includes stealth behavior that has no purpose other than to
     make it difficult to detect." 
     
     But apparently that old stone and glass-house adage applies here. Microsoft's own Systems
     Management Server (a.k.a. SMS) happens to have features surprisingly 'malicious' -- just like Back
     Orifice. SMS, in fact, does let you remotely control a user's PC without the client being aware of it.
     Apparently Microsoft included this feature at the request of their customers. 
     
     It should come as no surprise that some Microsoft actions could be characterized as malicious.
     Actually it's refreshing to have them finally admit it. And I got a good chuckle when the Cult of the
     Dead Cow issued a press release challenging Microsoft to recall SMS. And it's folly to assume that
     Symantec would scan for SMS in Norton AntiVirus, along with Back Orifice. 
     
     But it still raises the question of what is a virus. That feature is a useful tool when respected
     software vendor Microsoft sells it for many hundreds of dollars. But when a company calling
     themselves, "the most influential group of hackers in the world" includes that same feature, and gives
     it away for free, suddenly it's a virus. 
     
     But that's not all. It seems that many PC vendors have been shipping an ActiveX control that
     unknowingly opens up a user's system to rape and pillage. The HP version of the control allows an
     e-mail to automatically download a program locally, install it and run it. The SystemWizard Launch
     ActiveX control can be executed from an Outlook or Outlook Express client. According to Pharlap
     CEO Richard Smith, similar versions of this control are shipped on many major computer systems
     (but not all of them -- my IBM ThinkPad is safe). For more information on this topic, head over to
     www.tiac.net/users/smiths/acctroj/index.htm. 
     
     So is the SystemWizard Launch ActiveX control a virus? Well it certainly has some elements of a
     Trojan horse. It sits on your PC, looking benign, until someone executes it in the right way. And it
     can severely compromise your security -- this is a perfect way to deliver Back Orifice or SMS, for
     instance. Should Symantec's Norton Anti-Virus scan for this control as well? Or should you just turn
     ActiveX off in your browser? 
     
     I'm not sure I have an answer, but these lines are going to continue to blur. And as we connect more
     and more devices up the Internet, including phones, appliances and set-top boxes, "malicious"
     programs will have even more fertile ground to spread. And man, I'd hate to have my freezer
     infected with a virus.

20.0 The Last True Hacker 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     contributed by found on slashdot 
     So what exactly is a 'hacker'. Do the ethical hackers in
     the IBM ads count? Is Richard Stallman, as Steven Levy
     called him, the last true hacker? What about Linus Torvalds? 

     Boston Globe

     ECONOMIC PRINCIPALS Scientists and hackers 

     By David Warsh, Globe Staff, 07/25/99 

        If the essence of politics is to be found in the shifting meaning of words,
         then few words carry a more interesting charge these days than
     ''hacker.'' 

     For example, as one of a series of recent ads, IBM Corp. has been parading a
     photograph of employee Nick Simicich, ''Ethical Hacker.'' Flowing-bearded,
     fish-shirted, felt-hatted, granny-glassed, Simicich is described as a ''paid
     professional paranoid.''

     His job: to determine whether software systems are susceptible to hackers.
     His distinction: He protected the electrical power infrastructure in the United
     States from ''cyber-jackers bent on misdirecting electricity with bogus
     information.'' 

     So much for the limits of the current definition of hacker: the principled
     tester-of-limits vs. the high-tech saboteur.

     But if you listen carefully to the leading innovators in computer systems, you
     realize that the applicability of the term is expanding rapidly.

     Consider the story of how Linus Torvalds, and not Richard Stallman of the
     Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came to pose the chief threat to the
     world's first centibillionaire, Bill Gates. 

     Stallman would seem to be the hacker par excellence - ''the last true hacker,''
     as author Steven Levy called him in his famous book. Even though it was
     Harvard College that he entered in 1970, it was down the street at MIT that
     Stallman found his spiritual home. There he imbibed deeply the peculiar
     sensibility that is one of MIT's enduring contributions to computer culture.

     He rendered a small jewel of a hack of one sort a few years ago when he
     posted an official-looking sign on the spot that serves as the Wellesley
     terminus of the shuttle bus that has connected Wellesley College and MIT
     since the mid-1960s.

     Barbedall Square, it read. At the MIT end of the line, of course, is Kendall
     Square. (It helps to say them out loud.)

     Such is the world of an MIT hacker: high-spirited, clever, accomplished, and,
     just possibly, but not necessarily, oriented to the occasional countercultural
     prank. According to Stallman, the use of ''hacker'' to mean ''security breaker''
     is mass media confusion. Hackers themselves, he says, use the word to mean
     ''Someone who loves to program and enjoys being clever at it.''

     Stallman's significance goes far beyond a few practical jokes, however. It was
     in 1981 that a little start-up company known as Symbolics Inc. hired away
     most of the staff of MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab and set them to work
     writing proprietary software. 

     At about the same time, Digital Equipment introduced its new VAX
     computers, with brand-new proprietary operating systems. The community of
     pioneering software sharers that had grown out of the Model Railroad Club at
     MIT suddenly collapsed.

     So Stallman did a historic thing. Instead of joining the proprietary world, he set
     out to make a free, shareable operating system that would work on any
     computer and run any program. There would be none of the nondisclosure
     agreements that characterized the nascent software industry. 

     Stallman dubbed his ambitious project the GNU system. 

     But first there would have to be tools. His first big achievement was EMACS,
     a compiler and text editor that rendered possible more ambitious programming.
     Other programs followed.

     All were freely made available to others under the ''copyleft'' license Stallman
     and his friends devised to keep the underlying source code open - that is, to
     protect the right of other users to know and modify the basic code.

     Stallman's Waterloo was the operating system's ''kernel,'' the core part of the
     operating system where memory is allocated among all the other programs:
     scheduling, signalling, device input/output, and so on. 

     When Stallman turned his shoulder to the task in 1990, the dogma among
     computer scientists in cutting-edge American universities such as MIT was
     that something called a ''microkernel'' would be required to make a truly
     portable system. A microkernel would be a kind of coded general theory of all
     computer architectures; it would be required before such a system could run
     on any hardware.

     Cut to Helsinki in 1991. A young Finnish graduate student named Linus
     Torvalds, comfortably outside the circuits of grant-supported American
     computer science research, decided to try an alternative approach - a
     ''monolithic kernel,'' simpler, but far faster and already relatively
     well-understood. ''I am a pragmatic person,'' Torvalds has written. '' ... I didn't
     have to aim for such a lofty goal. I was interested in portability between real
     world systems, not theoretical systems.''

     So Torvalds read up on the systems in use, in search of common denominators
     between them. Once he had a design for a certain task - for memory
     management, say - that would be on the most popular chips, he put it out to an
     extensive list of correspondent hackers to see how it could be improved. At
     first it was written to suit just one architecture: the Intel 386.

     Gradually a kernel emerged that could control the most popular
     microprocessors - the 68K, the Sparc, the Alpha and the Power PC. Torvalds
     then combined his kernel with a good bit of the GNU programs Stallman and
     his friends had written, and presto! The operating system that has become
     known as Linux - similar in spirit to AT&T's Unix system but not based on it -
     was ready to be distributed and more or less continually improved. 

     And because it had been written - hacked - by an impassioned graduate
     student in Finland and a relentless code warrior in Cambridge and a few
     hundred collaborators for their individual satisfaction and shared use, it was
     available to others for free. And in the last 10 years the project originally
     envisaged by Stallman and Torvalds and a handful of others has grown into a
     credible threat to Windows NT - the Microsoft operating system with its
     secret proprietary source code on which rests Bill Gates' most basic hopes for
     the 21st century.

     ''Linux today has millions of users, thousand of developers, and a growing
     market,'' Torvalds has written in ''Open Sources: Voices from the Open
     Source Revolution,'' the O'Reilly & Associates anthology from which this
     account is drawn. ''I'd like to say I knew this would happen, that it's all part of
     the plan for world domination.

     ''But honestly this has all taken me a bit by surprise. I was much more aware
     of the transition from one Linux user to one hundred Linux users than the
     transition from one hundred to one million.''

     And the point? Simply that the neatly barbered and quietly circumspect
     Torvalds is every bit as much a hacker as Stallman - a fact the flamboyant
     Stallman readily concedes. 

     So what is a hacker, after all? Eric Raymond offers this definition in the third
     edition of his New Hacker's Dictionary: ''A person who enjoys exploring the
     details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as
     opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.''
     Torvalds' success suggests that even that definition may be too narrow.

     Remember, it was only 150 years ago that thinkers and wordsmiths of all sorts
     were trying to agree on a term that could apply equally to all the different sorts
     of intellectuals who had emerged from the precincts of philosophy and natural
     history. It seemed clear these new professionals shared an ethic. Their
     methods and goals were unfamiliar and, quite possibly unique. They even
     admitted women to their ranks!

     In the England of the 1830s, it took a decade before the term ''scientist''
     emerged and won common acceptance.

      Russian ISP Refuses To Spy On Customers
      (07/26/99, 6:35 a.m. ET)
      By Marina Moudrak, Data Communications 

      At least one Russian ISP is refusing to go along
      with a directive that lets the government spy on
      customers -- and it's paying the price. 

      The directive is known as System of Efficient
      ResearchMeasures 2 (SORM 2), and it gives Russia's
      Federal Security Service (FSB) the right to look into
      private e-mail without a warrant, under the pretense of
      sniffing out tax dodgers and corruption. 

      It also calls for ISPs to pay for surveillance equipment in
      their servers and a link to FSB headquarters in Moscow. 

      But ISP Bayard-Slavia Communications is refusing to go
      along with SORM-2, and now the government is taking
      action. 

      According to Bayard-Slavia director general Nail
      Murzakhanov, the FSB tried to shut down the ISP by
      withdrawing its license and challenging its right to
      frequencies used for its satellite connection to Moscow. 

      Eventually, it found a way to freeze the ISP's bank
      account so it couldn't pay for the satellite connection at
      all. 

      "We will never help the FSB implement illegal
      shadowing," Murzakhanov said. "We're the first ISP to
      struggle against illegal information collection.
      Unfortunately, we're also likely to become the first to be
      destroyed because of insubordination."

      With the L.A. district attorney's office on his case, Kevin Mitnick hopes
      Tony Serra will help him beat the rap 


      By Paul Elias , Omar Figueroa and Carolyn Hagin 
                          



     Tony Serra doesn't use a computer. He has never surfed
     the Net. On the whole, he'd rather sit in front of the fire with
     some 19th century American literature and enough marijuana
     to stone an elephant.
 
     The famous San Francisco defense lawyer is your basic
     hash-smoking Luddite.
 
     "My wife has a computer," he says. "She's on it every night.
     I can't get her off the fucking thing."
 
     It's no surprise then, that Serra has never defended anyone
     accused of a computer crime. He hasn't even come close in
     his 37-year legal career. "I do dope and murder, man," he
     says. "That's all I've done my entire life." As in defending the
     likes of Proposition 215, Black Panther Huey Newton and
     Ellie Nesler, the woman convicted of gunning down her
     child's molester.
 
     Serra once offered to defend Ted Kaczynski -- the king of
     the Luddites -- by invoking Kaczynski's anti-technology
     views. The Unabomber readily accepted the offer but a
     judge wouldn't allow it.
 
     But all of that was before Kevin Mitnick, the most revered
     martyr of hackerdom, placed a collect call to Serra's office
     last month looking for pro bono representation.
 
     Mitnick is the most notorious member of an emerging class
     of cybercriminals. Over the last decade, he has faced three
     federal prosecutions for hacking into other people's
     computers and related charges, and is now facing a case in
     state court.
 
     Luckily for Mitnick -- and for Serra -- the hacker's call was
     fielded by one of two bright acolytes who work in Serra's
     office, housed on a pier along the San Francisco waterfront.
     The two young lawyers then fiercely lobbied Serra to take
     the case, a single count of computer hacking that's being
     prosecuted by L.A. District Attorney Gil Garcetti's office.
     The charge was actually filed seven years ago, but Mitnick
     has yet to be arraigned. "Tony wasn't very excited about it at
     first," recalls Omar Figueroa, the 28-year-old lawyer who
     talked to Mitnick first.
 
     But when Figueroa and colleague Carolyn Hagin, 27,
     explained to Serra that the case was bigger than a mere
     fraud case -- that it came complete with a big counterculture
     community that knows how to get good press and involved a
     new civil rights frontier -- Serra relented. But with one
     proviso: Figueroa and Hagin would have to do all of the
     pretrial work, then give Serra a crash course in technology
     on the eve of trial. It's an arrangement that suits everybody
     just fine. "I've always had an interest in cybercrime," says
     Hagin. "It's part of our generation."
 
     Now even the 64-year-old Serra, who knows far more about
     Tibetan prayer flags and Native American rituals than he
     does about HTML and encryption, says he's looking forward
     to going to trial. "I view this as a political case," he says.
     Indeed, political cases are Serra's specialty, and he is the
     poet laureate of defense attorneys who successfully cast
     their clients as victims of oppressive government forces.
     "Political case" is also code for "good ink."
 
     Serra said the same thing about the Mendocino County
     murder trial of Eugene "Bear" Lincoln, a Native American
     who was accused of killing a white deputy sheriff during a
     shoot-out on a reservation in 1995.
 
     Press coverage was extensive and mostly favorable as Serra
     successfully turned the tables on Mendocino County
     prosecutors and sheriffs -- and the entire power structure of
     the area -- by arguing that Native Americans had suffered
     centuries worth of abuse and discrimination. An all-white
     jury acquitted Lincoln in 1997, believing he acted in
     self-defense.
 
     Word of Serra's victory circulated through the state's jails
     and prisons. Mitnick, along with much of the inmate
     population, was impressed by Serra's work on that case, and
     it reportedly prompted him to call Serra as his own case
     neared trial.
 
     Kevin Mitnick may not hold a college degree, but he is
     certainly no Luddite.
 
     Long before the Internet became a household staple and
     years before Yahoo and bandwidth emerged as
     commonplace jargon, the self-taught Mitnick was a
     cyberspace juvenile delinquent.
 
     At 17, Mitnick spent three months in L.A.'s Juvenile
     Detention Center for destroying Pacific Bell computer data.
     Two years later, in 1983, University of Southern California
     campus police arrested Mitnick while he was sitting at a
     computer in the school's terminal room, attempting to break
     into a Pentagon computer. He spent six months in a
     California Youth Authority prison after that arrest. But his
     two brief stints behind bars as a teen-ager seemed only to
     embolden him as an adult.
 
     Instead of using his computer skills for gainful employment,
     Mitnick couldn't shake his compulsion to hack. All of the
     myriad profiles of Mitnick available online paint him as the
     quintessential computer geek motivated not by money but by
     the ability to access highly sensitive information for the hell
     of it. He just couldn't resist the siren song of forbidden
     access.
 
     In 1987, he was arrested and convicted by a state court of
     stealing software from a software company and sentenced
     to 36 months of probation. Two years later, he pleaded guilty
     in federal court to breaking into a Digital Equipment Corp.
     computer, after which Los Angeles U.S. District Judge
     Mariana Pfaelzer sentenced him to a year in a prison and six
     months of therapy to combat his computer "addiction."
 
     In 1992, while Mitnick was working at the Tel Tec Detective
     Agency, the FBI -- suspecting that he was illegally using a
     commercial database system -- launched yet another
     investigation into his activities. Pfaelzer soon issued an arrest
     warrant for Mitnick, who was charged with one count of
     hacking and one count of violating the terms of his 1989
     probation. But when federal authorities showed up to arrest
     him, Mitnick had vanished, and a two-year, high-tech
     cat-and-mouse game with his pursuers began. He ultimately
     made the FBI's most-wanted list.
 
     At one point, in late 1992, investigators from the California
     Department of Motor Vehicles almost caught Mitnick.
     Someone using a valid law enforcement requestor code
     called the DMV and requested that a photo of a police
     informer be faxed to a number in Studio City. The number
     turned out to be a Kinko's copy center, and Mitnick was
     seen leaving the store with the fax. But Mitnick spotted the
     investigators, dropped the fax and outran them.
 
     Federal authorities finally arrested Mitnick in February 1995
     in Raleigh, N.C., after an extensive manhunt, which had
     been fueled by front-page coverage in The New York Times
     .
 
     He quickly agreed to plead guilty to violating his probation
     and to a new hacking charge filed by federal prosecutors in
     Raleigh and was sentenced to 22 months in prison. He was
     soon transferred to the Federal Detention Center in Los
     Angeles, where he faced 25 more counts of hacking and
     illegal copying of information during digital break-ins of
     companies, including Sun Microsystems Inc.
 
     In March of this year, he cut a plea bargain with federal
     prosecutors that requires him to serve an additional year in
     federal custody. In theory, he could move into a halfway
     house as early as next month to finish out his sentence.
 
     Though he pleaded guilty to the high-tech crimes against Sun
     and others, Mitnick claims he didn't share the information
     with anybody. Prosecutors and the victimized companies
     claim that $150 million worth of their research and
     development has been ruined.
 
     The government, though, is asking the court to order Mitnick
     to pay a more modest $1.5 million in restitution. But Mitnick's
     court-appointed lawyers, led by Donald Randolph of Santa
     Monica's Randolph & Levanas, contend that Mitnick caused
     little, if any, actual damage. They're arguing for a $5,000
     fine. Pfaelzer has scheduled a hearing on the subject for July
     26.
 
     Bespectacled and pudgy, Mitnick now uses his abundant
     nervous energy to review the case against him. He spends
     most of his waking hours poring over court documents and
     constantly calling his attorneys to discuss his case. "He
     reviews his case in detail," says Hagin, of Serra's office.
     "He's an extremely intelligent guy."
 
     Once Mitnick settles his federal affairs, he still has to
     contend with the L.A. DA's single charge of computer fraud
     for allegedly duping the DMV to fax him the informer's
     photo.
 
     It is that charge that may prevent him from getting into a
     halfway house to serve out the rest of his federal sentence.
     No bail in the state case, no halfway house. In fact, Mitnick
     fears prosecutors will try to have him moved from the
     federal jail to the dreaded county jail.
 
     "We've been waiting to prosecute him for five years," says
     L.A. Deputy District Attorney Larry Diamond, who brushes
     off criticism that the state charge and the $1 million bail
     amount to overkill. "Because he wants to finish his [federal]
     sentence in a halfway house," an unsympathetic Diamond
     retorts, "Kevin wants special treatment."
 
     In fact, argues Diamond, Mitnick has been receiving special
     treatment since Pfaelzer first put him on probation in 1989
     for hacking. The 25-year veteran of the DA's office is
     unimpressed with just about every aspect of Mitnick's case.
     He dismisses Mitnick as "just another case" and Serra as
     "just another defense attorney." As for his view of Pfaelzer:
     "She's coddled 'poor Kevin' from day one."
 
     Diamond also rejects the argument that the bail is excessive
     -- the bail schedule calls for $25,000 -- saying Mitnick has
     been a "notorious fugitive."
 
     But Diamond reserves his harshest criticism for the federal
     prosecutors on the Mitnick case. "The real story here," he
     growls during a telephone interview from his Van Nuys
     office, "is how the U.S. attorney gave this case away."
 
     To begin with, Diamond believes Mitnick shouldn't even be
     appearing in front of Pfaelzer, but rather in a federal court in
     North Carolina because that's where he was arrested back
     in 1995. Not only was he charged with violating his probation
     but he was indicted by a Raleigh grand jury on 25 fresh
     charges of hacking, wire fraud and theft of intellectual
     property.
 
     Mitnick cut a quick plea deal with Raleigh prosecutors so he
     could be transferred back to L.A. to face yet another set of
     hacking charges. The Southern California case was also
     disposed of with a plea deal, which Mitnick entered in
     March. "It's bizarre," Diamond says of the federal
     proceedings. "Completely bizarre."
 
     L.A. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Schindler, who handled
     Mitnick's latest federal case, has heard it all before. In fact,
     he's getting blasted from both sides of the Mitnick issue.
 
     Critics such as Diamond say he's gone too soft on Mitnick.
     Meanwhile, a growing number of young computer nerds
     protest that Mitnick is a political prisoner who has done little
     -- if anything -- illegal, and is relentlessly being pursued by
     different sets of prosecutors. Even if he did all the things that
     he has done, the theory goes, he's already received the
     harshest punishment ever for hacking. Pro-Mitnick
     protesters are pleading their case on numerous Web sites.
 
     But Schindler, who has been locking up hackers since 1991,
     says Mitnick got the same prison sentence he would have
     received had he gone to trial. "What we gave away [with the
     plea bargain] was the right to argue for an upward
     departure" in Mitnick's sentence, says Schindler, referring to
     a prosecutor's ability to seek a longer prison term than the
     one called for in federal sentencing guidelines.
 
     Schindler concedes that Mitnick's sentence is the longest that
     he has seen during the years he's been prosecuting hackers.
     Kevin Poulsen, another infamous hacker that Schindler
     prosecuted, received a 51-month sentence. He was also
     ordered to pay about $100,000 in restitution.
 
     When all is said and done, Mitnick will have been sentenced
     to 68 months in federal custody, may yet do state time, and
     may also be ordered to pay several times the restitution
     Poulsen did. And as for Diamond's forum-shopping charge,
     Schindler says, "Mitnick begged us to transfer him to L.A."
 
     That J. Tony Serra has taken Kevin Mitnick's case goes to
     show how ubiquitous this Internet thing has become. The
     Digital Age has truly affected all segments of society if it has
     touched an aging radical lawyer like Serra, who has his
     marijuana prescribed by a doctor and who's known for
     driving rusting junkers around town, only to abandon them on
     the street the minute they finally give out on him.
 
     His association with Mitnick will certainly make him and his
     associates extremely simpatico with all of hackerdom. That
     crowd is facing increased government scrutiny as the
     Department of Justice continues to dedicate more money
     each year to fighting cybercrime. "This was our first case
     relating to computers," says Santa Monica defense attorney
     Gregory Vinson, who is assisting Randolph with Mitnick's
     federal case. "It's an area we are going to develop more."
 
     U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has asked Congress to
     give the Justice Department's computer crimes and
     intellectual property division an additional $120 million to fight
     cybercrime next year. Other agencies -- federal and local --
     are beefing up their cybercrime forces as well.
 
     "If someone would have told me two years ago that I would
     be prosecuting Internet fraud, I seriously would have laughed
     in their face," Jay Perlman, deputy chief of the Securities and
     Exchange Commission Office of Internet Enforcement, said
     recently at a cybercrime symposium in Virginia.
 
     In the wake of several Mitnick-inspired hack jobs on
     government Web sites in the past year, a federal
     multi-agency task force has been formed in Dallas
     specifically to fight hackers. The task force has issued 16
     warrants in 12 jurisdictions, but has yet to charge anyone
     with a crime. "So far, cybercrime has mostly been a federal
     effort," says Jennifer Granick, a San Francisco criminal
     defense attorney who is carving out a nice niche for herself
     as a computer crime specialist. "But the locals are getting
     increasingly involved, too."
 
     By 2005, it's predicted that one billion people worldwide will
     be on the Internet, and prosecutors expect the number of
     cybercrime cases will rise accordingly.
 
     A closer look makes it clear that Serra and Mitnick have
     more in common than not. Both stand out as countercultural
     icons for their peers. Serra is a hero to every hippie who
     went to law school, while Mitnick appeals to disaffected
     youths who are known as hackers, crackers and high-tech
     poseurs. Both have inspired the creation of Hollywood
     movies. James Woods played a Serra-like character in
     1989's True Believer while Mitnick's life goes on the big
     screen next month in Takedown , which chronicles the
     manhunt for him.
 
     So it's not a stretch to imagine Serra representing more
     hackers and others accused of computer crimes down the
     line.
 
     But first, he's got to learn how to use a computer -- or at
     least speak the language. "I don't even know any of the
     terminology," he says. "I'm organic, man."
 
                                                 
     Tony Serra 
 
     He hasn't even spoken with Mitnick yet. Instead, it's been
     Figueroa and Hagin who have been answering Mitnick's
     daily telephone calls. Truth is, this is really their case. Sure,
     Serra will handle the trial and all the big hearings such as a
     motion to dismiss. And it will be Serra pushing the David
     versus Goliath angle and garnering all of the press.
 
     But it's Figueroa and Hagin who will do the heavy lifting,
     such as wheedling discovery out of Diamond and handling
     Mitnick's bail appeal. That's the way it works in Serra's
     office, and the two young lawyers are appreciative.
 
     Both have been attorneys for less than a year and probably
     would not have landed work on such a high-profile case --
     albeit for expenses only -- if not for Serra. He says he'll give
     them a chance to examine witnesses if Mitnick's case gets to
     trial.
 
     Both appear ready. Serra always seems to have smart
     neophyte lawyers in orbit around his office. Figueroa
     graduated from Stanford Law School while Hagin is a
     product of the University of San Francisco School of Law.
     Both gained invaluable experience as clerks to Serra when
     they rented a house in Ukiah during the Bear Lincoln trial,
     during which they wrote many of the case's motions.
 
     They also appear smart enough to ignore Serra's complaints
     of high-technology ignorance. "Tony pretends to be mystified
     by computers," says Figueroa. "But he's not. He'll be ready
     for trial."

     Wired- Sentencing Delayed       
      http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/20953.html
      
      More Delays for Mitnick
      by Douglas Thomas 
      
      3:00 a.m.  27.Jul.99.PDT
      The sentencing hearing for convicted cracker Kevin Mitnick was postponed for a fourth time Monday
      and rescheduled for 9 August. 
          
      US District Judge Marianne Pfaelzer issued a continuance because of scheduling conflicts, according
      to a court clerk. 
      
         
      Mitnick pleaded guilty on 26 March to five counts of a 25-count federal indictment and two related
      counts from a Northern California indictment. His plea agreement resulted in a 54-month prison sentence, 
      making Mitnick eligible to be released into a halfway house pending Pfaelzer's approval and
      permission from the State of California. 
      
      A pattern of delays has plagued the case from its onset. What remains to be determined in Mitnick's 
      sentencing is the judgment for restitution which Pfaelzer has made clear she will issue. The government
      contends that Mitnick should be forced to repay US$1.5 million dollars in damages to  the victim companies. 
      
      In the pre-sentence investigation report, Mitnick's attorneys said their client is unable to pay anywhere 
      near that amount and should only be required to repay about $5,000. 
      
      Mitnick had already spent more than four years behind bars at the Los Angeles Metropolitan Detention Center. 
      
      At the original hearing in March, sentencing was delayed until 14 June. That hearing was again continued to 
      12 July, when attorneys were unable to reach an agreement about the terms of restitution. The judge was 
      unprepared to rule, due to a last minute filing by the government to which the defense was unprepared to respond. 
      
      
      Mitnick Fans Await Denouement
      by Douglas Thomas 
      
      3:00 p.m.  13.Jul.99.PDT
      LOS ANGELES -- Kevin Mitnick's allies rallied here Monday, as the cracker's expected prison term is still up in the air. 
      
      Mitnick's sentencing hearing was attended by a number of computer hackers, fresh from Las Vegas where they had attended the annual DefCon
      hacker meeting.      
      
      Defense attorney Donald Randolph spoke to a gathering of a dozen or so hackers in the hallway. "It was nice to see some friendly faces," he said,
      and thanked them for their continued support. 
      
      That support was much needed after US District Judge Marianne Pfaelzer had been particularly tough on both attorneys Monday, comparing them to
      bickering kids. She went so far as to call the government's motion to sanction attorney Randolph for the release of several letters from victim
      companies "childish." 
      
      The current sentencing proceedings mark the climax to what has been a years-long campaign in the hacker community. 
      
      Hackers have focused their attention on the case, launching Web sites like kevinmitnick.com, protests reaching as far as Moscow, and Web site
      defacements to draw attention to what they see as Mitnick's unjust prosecution and a violation of his Constitutional and civil rights. 
      
      Kevinmitnick.com tracks media coverage of the case, and offers information, commentary, and online versions of most of the court filings. Other
      activists have printed "Free Kevin" bumper stickers and T-shirts, and some have proposed relatively mainstream money-making ventures to help
      contribute to Mitnick's legal defense fund. 
      
      While the activists continually grouse over media coverage of the Mitnick case, citing inaccurate or misinformed accounts, they have also learned
      the importance of working to provide the press with accurate information. 
      
      Particularly infuriating to hackers are claims that Mitnick has been accused or convicted of stealing credit card information (he hasn't), that he has
      appeared on either the America's Most Wanted TV program or on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted List" (neither is true), or that he has threatened
      national security by breaking into NORAD (also not true). 
      
      The importance of these media reports and mis-characterizations were driven home last week when a municipal court judge in Van Nuys, CA set
      Mitnick's bail for his upcoming state case at $1 million dollars, based primarily on media coverage of Mitnick's hacking exploits. 
      
      Judge Pfaelzer barred Mitnick from the hearing, and wondered "when do newspaper stories count as evidence in a court of law?" 
      
      Many hackers have challenged the court's decisions, ranging from the denial of a bail hearing to a four-year pre-trial incarceration. They charge
      that the court has repeatedly denied requests for access to court information considered vital to Mitnick's defense. 
      
      Although the government's goal has been to "send a message" to hackers about the severity of these crimes and to demonstrate their willingness
      to prosecute them, hackers appear to be receiving a different message. 
      
      One hacker said Monday that the court is doing little to deter him, and instead is, in effect, telling him "be more careful, don't get caught." 
      
      Another hacker, Kerry Zero, said the government's agenda in this case is to set a foundation which "makes it easier to prosecute hackers in the
      future." 
      
      Not surprisingly, many supporters painted Mitnick as the victim in the case. They said that the financial damages being claimed are overstated, and
      that no adequate explanation has been offered for why Mitnick was held for so long without a trial or bail.  
      
      "All this talk about protecting the victim -- Kevin is the victim in this case," said one hacker, who asked not to be identified. 
      
      After the hearing, three hackers, Teklord, Bonq, and Sig9, all expressed deeper concerns about the case.  
      
      For Teklord, the result was one of dismay. "I'm confused about the government," he said. "The system is supposed to protect people and it's failing
      us." 
      
      Bonq expressed a similar confusion. "I don't know who to trust." And after watching the hearing, Sig9 said he had "lost a lot of respect for the
      system." 
      
      For many hackers, the Mitnick case has been a civics lesson in how the system works. 
      
      Biff Macki, a hacker who has followed the Mitnick case for some time thinks the lesson is pretty clear-cut. "If the government wants you, they'll get
      you, no matter what," he said. 
      
      The problem, he says, is in the system itself. 
      
      "[The US government has] millions of dollars to spend and it is impossible to organize an adequate defense on 15 minutes of collect calls a day from
      federal prison."

      AOL USERS DUPED BY TEENS,
      COPS SAY
      Hundreds Sent Credit Card Numbers in Response to E-Mails 

      July 23, 1999 

      By Valerie Kalfrin 

      SACRAMENTO, Calif. (APBNews.com) -- Two teenagers who police
      say illegally accessed America Online and wrote e-mails pretending to
      represent the company duped about 900 people into giving them their
      credit card numbers, authorities said today. 

      Dino Dagdagan, 18, of Carson and a 17-year-old home-schooled
      Sacramento student are charged with felony possession of access to
      credit accounts and other crimes. 

      The two allegedly sent out thousands of e-mails to America Online
      customers, claiming there was a problem with their accounts and
      asking the subscribers to visit a Web site to correct matters, officials
      said. 

      Fake Web site 

      But the Web site, too, was a fake, set up
      to glean the unsuspecting customers'
      credit card numbers, said Sgt. Rick
      Gibson, a spokesman for the Sacramento
      County Sheriff's Department. 

      "People should call the company and
      make sure it's a true communication and
      a real Web site," Gibson told
      APBNews.com today. "Out of every
      10,000 e-mails they sent out, about 200 customers would give them
      information." 

      The 17-year-old allegedly traded or sold the numbers in Internet chat
      rooms while Dagdagan allegedly used the credit card accounts to buy
      computer equipment, which he then sold via the online auction site
      eBay, Gibson said. 

      Task force tracks down suspects 

      Customers alerted police to the scam about a month ago when they
      noticed purchases on their credit card bills that they had not made,
      police said. A Northern California multi-agency task force, including
      computer-crimes experts from the Department of Justice and FBI,
      helped track down the youths, Gibson noted, although he would not go
      into specifics. 

      "We have ways of doing things," he said. 

      The juvenile, who was released to his parents' custody last week, is
      accused of obtaining the illegal access to the Sterling, Va.-based
      Internet service provider, officials said. 

      Dagdagan, who is free on $10,000 bond, also faces possession of
      stolen property and an additional computer-crimes charge. He's due to
      be arraigned July 28 in a Lynwood court. 

      America Online's corporate headquarters did not return a phone call
      seeking comment today.

      Pariah's Software Has Value 
 
      By Jason Levitt 
 
        xcept for its peculiar name and seemingly sinister authors, Back
        Orifice 2000, the recently released remote administration software for
      the Windows and Windows 2000 platforms, might be considered a
      contender in any comparative product review. Instead, it's a pariah,
      demonized because it's been misused by some Internet villains, and
      ignored because its authors don't appear to have day jobs. Yet this
      software is deserving of closer attention, if only because it's high-quality
      programming released as free software under the GNU Public License.
      Sure, there's reason enough not to trust the software--the employees of
      the virtual vendor that created it, the Cult of the Dead Cow, won't reveal
      their real names. Nevertheless, BO2k doesn't look so bad stacked up
      against mainstream commercial competitors such as Symantec's
      pcAnywhere, Compaq's Carbon Copy, and Artisoft's CoSession
      Remote.
 
      Am I advocating the use of dangerous software on your LAN? Absolutely
      not. But I don't think BO2k should be dismissed because the authors
      have a political agenda. Even Jason Garms, Microsoft's lead product
      manager for Windows NT security, concedes BO2k does "little different
      from what legitimate remote-control software can do." So what is
      Microsoft's objection? According to Garms, it's that BO2k is "designed
      to be stealthy and evade detection by the user." This is a reasonable
      objection, and it's the primary reason it's difficult to take the software
      seriously as an end-user product. Such software is easy to abuse,
      especially when it's free and comes with complete source code.
 
      The Cult's "Minister of Propaganda," who goes by the name "Deth
      Vegetable," is the first to admit the cult is no fan of Microsoft, and, in
      fact, one reason for BO2k's existence is to convince Microsoft to "finally
      implement a security model in their Windows operating system." I would
      prefer Microsoft engineer a new operating system (see Internet Zone),
      but revamping the Windows security model to create a secure system
      would be nearly as much effort. Even open-source pundit Eric Raymond
      agrees that "BO2k exposes the fact that the so-called `security' of
      Windows is a bad joke."
 
      It's easy to see that free software that can control PCs remotely will be
      abused. But BO2k will ultimately help more than hinder, by revealing the
      inadequacies of the Windows security model and providing useful
      source code for developers.

27.0 UCITA Moves Forward - Will Remove Vendor Liability

      isn't a federal law but a law that will be passed around
      to all the states to enact individually making it even
      harder to defeat. The proposal will allow software
      manufacturers to sell software that is broken with no
      liability, even if they knew it didn't work. It gives
      vendors the right to disable software remotely without
      prior authorization from the customer. It would prevent
      reverse engineering and place a gag order on anyone
      who said anything bad about a product.

      UCITA is going to hurt you if you don't watch out
 
      By Dan Gillmor
      07/26/99 All IT managers have their share of horror stories in
      dealing with software and the companies that sell it -- buggy
      products, slow response by vendors and so on. But if some
      proposed legislation becomes law around the U.S., your
      worries may just be starting. 
 
      By the time you read this, the National Conference of
      Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) is likely to
      have endorsed the Uniform Computer Information
      Transactions Act (UCITA). This legislation is high on the
      software industry's wish list, because it would tilt the balance
      of power to vendors -- and away from users. 
 
      Even if the mounting opposition somehow persuades the
      commissioners to back off, recent history shows that the
      software industry won't give up. This issue isn't going away,
      no matter what happens at the commissioners meeting this
      week in Denver. 
 
      A variety of reputable consumer and professional
      organizations oppose this proposal -- among them, the
      Federal Trade Commission, the Association for Computing
      Machinery, the Association for Information Management and
      Consumers Union. Here are some of their objections: 
 
         o Sellers could legally disclaim any obligation to sell
           products that work. They would be legally immune even
           if they knew about defects before the sale and
           deliberately failed to disclose the defects, no matter how
           serious. 
 
         o In the event of a dispute, a vendor could disable a
           customer's software remotely, even if that totally
           disrupted the customer's business. The seller would have
           a unilateral right to decide that the customer was
           violating the terms of the contract; a buyer would have
           to take the vendor to court in response. 
 
         o Reverse engineering, used by security experts to
           examine software, could be prohibited, increasing the risk
           that buggy products and viruses would go undetected. 
 
         o A vendor could prohibit a user from publicly commenting
           on the quality or performance of a product. In other
           words, if it didn't work, you couldn't tell your colleagues
           at other companies or vice versa.
 
      UCITA is itself a backup plan. The industry's original strategy
      was to get a rewrite of the Uniform Commercial Code, the
      system designed to ensure uniform laws dealing with
      commerce. But when the American Law Institute -- the
      NCCUSL's co-drafter of Uniform Commercial Code proposals
      -- listened to the opponents and backed away from the idea,
      the software companies persuaded the NCCUSL to push
      ahead with UCITA anyway. (For more history and information,
      check out a detailed account at www.infoworld.com/ucita at
      the Web site of Computerworld's sister publication Infoworld.) 
 
      If the commissioners endorse UCITA, the proposed law would
      move into state legislatures around the nation this year.
      Whatever happens, the industry's relentless pursuit of this
      legislation should be a wake-up call to other IT people. 
 
      Get ready to fight this legislation in your statehouses. Whether
      it's UCITA or something else, the software barons won't stop
      pushing against your rights. Stay on your guard, or you'll
      regret it.

       UCITA: Summary information

       UCITA and the issues that revolve around it are extremely complex. It raises many thorny problems of which the wisest of the wise would have
       trouble striking a fair balance, and its potential consequences in the electronic-commerce world of the future is surely any mortal's prediction.
       Yet the process by which it could become the law of the land is obscure, convoluted, and highly legalistic, making it difficult for everyone who
       has a stake in what it says to have input into its development. 

       The purpose of this page is to provide some background and resources for those who want to understand UCITA better and for those who want
       to find a way to have their voice heard. I obviously have my own point of view on the act and what I think it means for InfoWorld readers -- as
       I've said, I've gone from being naively optimistic about the chances for the law helping software customers to deeply concerned that it will only
       make things worse, and you can certainly learn why I feel that way here. But there's more than enough sources of information for you to make
       up your own mind and to decide what you want to do about it.

       This site includes:

            a brief explanation of what UCITA is and how the process works
            a background piece from Ed Foster on why he thinks UCITA is important to software customers 
            links to InfoWorld stories and columns on UCITA and Article 2B
            a list of the top dozen issues opponents of UCITA are concerned about 

       There are also a number of other Web sites that can provide you with all the details on the numerous issues involved in the 2B draft. The de
       facto clearinghouse for legal briefs and position papers from all sides in the process is the "Guide to the Proposed Law on Software
       Transactions" provided by Carol A. Kunze at http://www.2bguide.com/. This guide also provides further background on the UCC, reports that
       have appeared in the press about 2B and links to the current draft. Two recent papers posted there which do a good job of summarizing the
       opposing views on UCITA are the NCCUSL leadership's defense of the move from 2B to UCITA at http://www.2bguide.com/docs/nuaa.html
       and a rebuttal by law professor Jean Braucher at http://www.2bguide.com/docs/0499jb.html. 

       Many sites about Article 2B have not yet been updated to reflect the change to UCITA. Two Web sites that have a great deal of background
       information on consumer-related issues in the draft (few of which have changed to any substantial degree) are Ralph Nader's Consumer Project
       on Technology site at http://www.cptech.org/ucc/ and the site of "Bad Software" author and attorney Cem Kaner at
       http://www.badsoftware.com.


       What you can do

       With the July meeting where UCITA will be up for approval by the NCCUSL commissioners fast approaching, readers must act quickly if they
       are to influence the outcome. One simple thing you can is to sign our e-mail petition, which reads as follows:

       "In light of the concerns previously expressed over proposed UCC Article 2B by a variety of interest groups, and the lack of time such groups
       have had to study and respond to its new reincarnation as a uniform act, the undersigned urge the National Conference of Commissioners on
       Uniform State Laws to not approve the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act at this time."

       If you agree, "sign" the petition by sending an e-mail to us at ucita@infoworld.com with any additional comments you'd like to make and your
       name, title, company, city, and state. The results will be presented to the NCCUSL commissioners in Denver to help demonstrate to them that
       the concern about UCITA is widespread. 

       An even more effective step is to write directly to the NCCUSL commissioners who represent your state. The Society for Information
       Management has urged its membership to do this, and InfoWorld readers could make a big difference by adding their voices to that of SIM's
       members. To get the list of commissioners for your state, along with a draft letter you can customize, visit SIM's site at
       http://www.simnet.org/public/programs/issues/ucccode.html.

       It's not too early to make sure your state legislators and the governor also are aware of your concerns about UCITA. While we won't know until
       the end of July whether UCITA will be approved for distribution to the state legislatures, that's where the fight will move next if the
       commissioners OK it. Even if they reject UCITA, there is a possibility that "rogue" versions of the law will be introduced in some states in any
       case. So the more aware those in your state's government are of the controversial nature of UCITA, the better.

     U.S. Drafting Plan for Computer
     Monitoring System

     By JOHN MARKOFF

         The Clinton Administration has developed a plan for an extensive
          computer monitoring system, overseen by the Federal Bureau of
          Investigation, to protect the nation's crucial data networks from
     intruders. 

     The plan, an outgrowth of the Administration's anti-terrorism program, has
     already raised concerns from civil liberties groups. 

     A draft prepared by officials at the National Security Council last month,
     which was provided to The New York Times by a civil liberties group,
     calls for a sophisticated software system to monitor activities on
     nonmilitary Government networks and a separate system to track networks
     used in crucial industries like banking, telecommunications and
     transportation. 

     The effort, whose details are still being debated within the Administration,
     is intended to alert law enforcement officials to attacks that might cripple
     Government operations or the nation's economy. 

     But because of the increasing power of the nation's computers and their
     emerging role as a backbone of the country's commerce, politics and
     culture, critics of the proposed system say it could become a building block
     for a surveillance infrastructure with great potential for misuse. 

     They also argue that such a network of monitoring programs could itself be
     open to security breaches, giving intruders or unauthorized users a vast
     window into Government and corporate computer systems. 

     Government officials said the changing nature of military threats in the
     information age had altered the nature of national security concerns and
     created a new sense of urgency to protect the nation's information
     infrastructure. 

     "Our concern about an organized cyberattack has escalated dramatically,"
     Jeffrey Hunker, the National Security Council's director of information
     protection, who is overseeing the plan, said Tuesday. "We do know of a
     number of hostile foreign governments that are developing sophisticated
     and well-organized offensive cyber attack capabilities, and we have good
     reason to believe that terrorists may be developing similar capabilities." 

                                As part of the plan, networks of
                                thousands of software monitoring
                                programs would constantly track
                                computer activities looking for
                                indications of computer network
                                intrusions and other illegal acts. 

                                The plan calls for the creation of a
                                Federal Intrusion Detection Network,
                                or Fidnet, and specifies that the data it
                                collects will be gathered at the
     National Infrastructure Protection Center, an interagency task force
     housed at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

     Such a system, to be put fully in place by 2003, is meant to permit
     Government security experts to track "patterns of patterns" of information
     and respond in a coordinated manner against intruders and terrorists. 

     The plan focuses on monitoring data flowing over Government and national
     computer networks. That means the systems would potentially have
     access to computer-to-computer communications like electronic mail and
     other documents, computer programs and remote log-ins. 

     But an increasing percentage of network traffic, like banking and financial
     information, is routinely encrypted and would not be visible to the monitor
     software. Government officials argue that they are not interested in
     eavesdropping, but rather are looking for patterns of behavior that suggest
     illegal activity. 

     Over the last three years, the Pentagon has begun to string together entire
     network surveillance systems using filters that report data to a central site,
     much as a burglar alarm might be reported at the local police station. 

     Officials said such a system might have protected against intrusions
     recently reported in computers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which
     produces information like the consumer price index that can affect the
     performance of the stock market. 

     The draft of the plan, which has been circulated widely within the
     executive branch, has generated concern among some officials over its
     privacy implications. Several officials involved in the debate over the plan
     said that the situation was "fluid" and that many aspects were still not final.

     The report is vague on several crucial points, including the kinds of data to
     be collected and the specific Federal and corporate computer networks to
     be monitored. The report also lacks details about the ways information
     collected in non-Governmental agencies would be maintained and under
     what conditions it would be made available to law enforcement personnel. 

     Government officials said that the National Security Council was
     conducting a legal and technical review of the plan and that a final version
     is to be released in September, subject to President Clinton's approval. 

     The plan was created in response to a Presidential directive in May 1998
     requiring the Executive Branch to review the vulnerabilities of the Federal
     Government's computer systems in order to become a "model of
     information and security." 

     In a cover letter to the draft Clinton writes: "A concerted attack on the
     computers of any one of our key economic sectors or Governmental
     agencies could have catastrophic effects." 

     But the plan strikes at the heart of a growing controversy over how to
     protect the nation's computer systems while also protecting civil liberties --
     particularly since it would put a new and powerful tool into the hands of the
     F.B.I. 

     Increasingly, data flowing over the Internet is becoming a vital tool for law
     enforcement, and civil liberties experts said law enforcement agencies
     would be under great temptation to expand the use of the information in
     pursuit of suspected criminals. 

     The draft of the plan "clearly recognizes the civil liberties implications," said
     James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and
     Technology, a Washington civil liberties group, "But it brushes them away."

     The draft states that because Government employees, like those of many
     private companies, must consent to the monitoring of their computer
     activities, "the collection of certain data identified as anomalous activity or
     a suspicious event would not be considered a privacy issue." 

     Dempsey conceded the legal validity of the point, but said there was
     tremendous potential for abuse. 

     "My main concern is that Fidnet is an ill-defined monitoring system of
     potentially broad sweep," he said. "It seems to place monitoring and
     surveillance at the center of the Government's response to a problem that
     is not well suited to such measures." 

     The Federal Government is making a concerted effort to insure that civil
     liberties and privacy rights are not violated by the plan, Hunker said. 

     He said that data gathered from non-Government computer networks will
     be collected separately from the F.B.I.-controlled monitoring system at a
     separate location within a General Services Administration building. He
     said that was done to keep non-Government data at arm's length from law
     enforcement. 

     The plan also has drawn concern from civil libertarians because it blends
     civilian and military functions in protecting the nation's computer networks.
     The draft notes that there is already a Department of Defense "contingent"
     working at the F.B.I.'s infrastructure protection center to integrate
     intelligence, counterintelligence and law enforcement efforts in protecting
     Pentagon computers. 

     "The fight over this could make the fight over encryption look like nothing,"
     said Mary Culnan, a professor at Georgetown University who served on a
     Presidential commission whose work led to the May 1998 directive on
     infrastructure protection. 

     "The conceptual problem is that there are people running this program who
     don't understand how citizens feel about privacy in cyberspace." 

     The Government has been discussing the
     proposal widely with a number of industry
     security committees and associations in recent
     months. 

     Several industry executives said there is still reluctance on the part of
     industry to directly share information on computer intrusions with law
     enforcement. 

     "They want to control the decision making process," said Mark Rasch, vice
     president and general counsel of Global Integrity, a company in Reston,
     Va., coordinating computer security for the financial services industries. 

     One potential problem in carrying out the Government's plan is that
     intrusion-detection software technology is still immature, industry
     executives said. 

     "The commercial intrusion detection systems are not ready for prime time,"
     said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International in Menlo
     Park, Calif., and a pioneer in the field of intrusion detection systems. 

     Current systems tend to generate false alarms and thus require many
     skilled operators. 

     But a significant portion of the $1.4 billion the Clinton Administration has
     requested for computer security for fiscal year 2000 is intended to be spent
     on research, and Government officials said they were hopeful that the
     planned effort would be able to rely on automated detection technologies
     and on artificial intelligence capabilities. 

     For several years computer security specialists have used software
     variously known as packet filters, or "sniffers," as monitoring devices to
     track computer intruders. Like telephone wiretaps, such tools can be used
     to reconstruct the activities of a computer user as if a videotape were
     made of his computer display. 

     At the same time, however, the software tools are routinely misused by
     illicit computer network users in stealing information such as passwords or
     other data. 

     Commercial vendors are beginning to sell monitoring tools that combine
     packet filtering with more sophisticated and automated intrusion detection
     software that tries to detect abuse by looking for behavior patterns or
     certain sequences of commands.

     Intelligence bill grants feds new computer security
     powers 

     BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

     The Senate this week voted unanimously to pass the fiscal 2000 Intelligence
     Authorization Act, which would provide federal law enforcement officials new
     authority to search government computers belonging to individuals who have
     access to classified information. 

     The new computer security provision comes in the wake of reports of espionage
     by China at the nation's nuclear laboratories and was part of a larger effort by
     the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to improve government
     counterintelligence procedures. 

     According to Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman of the Senate Select
     Committee on Intelligence, the bill requires employees who need access to
     classified information to sign a waiver allowing law enforcement officials to
     "access information stored in computers used in the performance of government
     duties." The provision is aimed specifically at enhancing the FBI's ability to
     investigate cases of possible espionage sooner rather than later. 

     The thorny issue of granting access to government computers for the purposes
     of investigating wrongdoing came into the limelight last month when officials at
     the Defense Threat Reduction Agency allegedly attempted to access the
     computer belonging to a senior technology trade advisor as he testified before
     Congress [FCW, July 19, 1999]. 

     "This provision is intended to avoid the problems we have seen with the FBI's
     reluctance to access 'government' computers without a warrant in the course of
     an espionage investigation," Shelby said. "There should be no question that
     investigative agencies may search the computer of an individual with access to
     classified information."

      Pulling from the LA Times article that we linked to on
      Monday, the UK Register runs a story on how local US
      Police departments are legally accepting large grants
      from IT firms in exchange for going after pirates.
      Companies such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard offer cash
      and other perks to local law enforcement agencies while
      they work on cases beneficial to the corporation. Local
      Police agencies see nothing wrong with this. (Why hire
      private detectives when you can just hire the local

     US police funded by IT giants
   
     Hi-tech companies are paying out thousands of dollars to hard-up police departments in the
     US to help combat computer-related crime. 
   
     According to a report in the LA Times, Intel regularly slips police departments in Oregon
     $100,000 a year to help pay the wages of a few law enforcement professionals. 
   
     It's also more than happy to part with $10,000 to kit out the odd sheriff's department with a
     wire-tap or two. 
   
     Then there's Hewlett-Packard which is more than happy to let police officers use its
     corporate jet if it helps catch a computer villain. 
   
     Snag is, some people think this is an abuse of the system. They claim these firms are
     "buying justice" in their bid to crackdown on computer crime which reportedly cost the US
     $3 billion last year. 
   
     But one outspoken officer told the LA Times that such allegations were way out of line. 
   
     "If you're inferring that we're paid off, that's not right," Sgt Michael Tsuchida of the
     Sacramento County Sheriff's Office told the LA Times. 
   
     "I'll eat your dinner, sleep in your hotel and still arrest you if you're breaking the law," he
     said. 
   
     It's nice to know that the judgement of the boys in blue is not swayed by a few greenbacks. 
   
     In a way, the hacks at The Register are no different. They swan off on fancy
     all-expenses-paid press trips, get taken out to swanky restaurants -- and still manage to

      Computer virus infection rates have doubled since 1998

      Stopping the Spread
 
      Are computer viruses becoming an epidemic? A recent survey conducted
      by ICSA.net, a company that provides computer security information to
      corporations, reports that computer virus infection rates have doubled since
      1998 and quadrupled since 1997. Based on responses from tech
      departments at 300 U.S. corporations and government agencies, the survey
      also finds a comparable increase in costs. "The cost of having viruses, given
      the frequency of when you get them and what happens after you get them,
      is more than doubling every year," Peter Tippett, chairman of ICSA.net, told
      Newsweek.com. "We can't conclude that anything has happened that will
      prevent things from becoming twice as bad next year," he adds. 
 
      One reason for the rise in infections are rates of transmission, which have
      dramatically increased in the past several years. Between 1980 and 1995
      computer viruses were transmitted primarily via floppy disks, usually taking
      a year or more to become prevalent. By 1995, macro virusesùwhich
      primarily live in MS Word or Excel documents and spread via file
      sharingùhad decreased that time to a few months. The most recent
      generation, dubbed "'Net-enabled" or "communications-enabled" viruses, use
      the Internet or e-mail to replicate, and can reach epidemic proportions within
      days. These new viruses could represent the greatest threat thus far. 
 
      The solution, Tippett says, is to use anti-virus programs and tools correctly.
      The survey reported that 83 percent of the companies surveyed had
      anti-virus software on 90 percent of their computers, but often failed to use
      it properly. For example, 40 percent of those companies used "periodic
      scanning" on desktopsùscanning for viruses once a day, for example, or
      every time the system restartsùinstead of enabling anti-virus programs'
      full-time background scanning functions. Doing the latter, Tippett advises,
      increases the chance of discovering the virus before it spreads unknowingly
      to the next victim. Other advice: protect servers, gateways anddesktops,
      and update anti-virus programs often. ù Laura Fording

32.0 Granny Hacker from Heck visits Def Con parts 1 to 3

      Granny Hacker From Heck Visits Def Con 
      Thursday, July 15, 1999 at 16:29:59
      by Carolyn Meinel - Writing For AntiOnline 

      July 1, 1999. A staffer from Loompanics calls to say that the Def Con
      convention staff has ordered them to not sell my "The Happy Hacker: A
      Guide to Mostly Harmless Hacking" (http://happyhacker.org/buyhh.html)
      at their upcoming computer criminal soiree.

      This means war! How can I best stick it to the Def Con d00dz? Oho,
      their web site (http://www.defcon.org) is advertising a Bastard Operator
      from Hell (BOFH) (http://www.rangsoc.demon.co.uk/bofh_last.htm)
      contest. A true BOFH should run a computer with all sorts of tantalizing
      services. Build something that looks like an eight year old could break in.
      Then the attacker runs exploit after exploit against the box. And every
      attack mysteriously SCREWS UP!!! Muhahaha. By offering a prize for
      the best victim computer, the Def Con guys hops to get better targets
      for the hackers playing Capture the Flag.

      Amarillo, TX, July 6 and 7, I'm out there with Happy Hacker Wargame
      director Vincent Larsen and wargame admin Jon to put together our
      BOFH entry: Fangz. Ah, yes, Fangz, an Intel box running Red Hat Linux
      (at least that's what any port scanner would tell you, snicker). It runs ftp,
      pop3, smtp, a DNS server, telnet with a guest account with no
      password, guest access to vi and a C compiler; and a Lithium Quake
      server with back doors in place. Ahem, every service is working
      according to the RFCs, but not quite running the way hackers would
      expect:):)

      OK, let's get this straight. All I did was provide the hardware and use
      the Hacker Wargame to test various iterations of Vincent and Jon's
      Process Based Security (http://www.sage-inc.com) modifications to
      Red Hat Linux. Red Hat is a hacker's paradise. A clean install of the
      latest version has over 200 ways to break into it. Vincent and Jon's
      version of Red Hat, however, would make the BOFH himself proud.
      That's why I decided against entering a FreeBSD or OpenBSD system.
      They have pretty good security, too. But they don't TORMENT hackers
      the way Process Based Security does.

      At sunrise Friday morning, July 9, I caught a ride on the Happy Hacker
      Godfather's King Air business jet, along with him and Jon. Also there
      was this giant Texan on board. I asked him, "You look like a bodyguard.
      You look like you could pick up someone by the neck and hold him out
      at arm's length."

      "I'm an interior decorator. That's my story and I'm sticking with it."

      Nine AM we are on site at the Alexis Park hotel. We stagger along with
      Fangz, a monitor, laptop, my favorite Ethernet hub, my crummy backup
      Ethernet hub, lots of spare 10BASE-T cabling, tools, and duct tape just
      in case I need to tape anyone to the wall.

      A Def Con "goon" (security guard) helps us out by taking us to the head
      of the registration line. Who should be handling, um, exceptional cases
      such as ourselves but Pete Shipley. As his mouth drops with surprise to
      see us Happy Hacksters out in force, he fails to flash his copyrighted
      vampire fangs. Now these are very important, copyrighted vampire
      fangz, er, I mean, fangs. Shipley's lawyer actually sent several letters to
      the publisher of my Happy Hacker book claiming that Shipley had gotten
      a copyright on wearing vampire fangs, so the guy on the cover of my
      book wearing fangs owed Shipley royalties. Or something like this. 

      Anyhow, the publisher, being a hacker himself (Dr. Mark Ludwig),
      decided to have a little fun with Shipley. In the second edition he blotted
      out Shipley's fanged features with a green blob reading "hey man get my
      face off this cover."

      Anyhow, I think Mark using Shipley's copyrighted fangs on my book
      cover is why Shipley can't wear fangs any more. That must be what got
      Shipley to being such a major enemy of mine. After all, my lady BOFH
      personality ought to win the adulation of hackers everywhere. LART,
      LART, who has the LART?;^)
      (http://www.winternet.com/~eric/sysadmin/lart.1m.html)

      Shipley swears it isn't because I hacked him at Def Con 3 in front of
      dozens of witnesses (see Granny Hacker from Heck). Oh, yes, if you
      are a reporter, contact me and I'll give you phone numbers for two of
      those witnesses.

      Well, that fangless Shipley just about ruined my day. What next, would
      Cult of the Dead Cow's (http://cultdeadcow.com) Deth Vegetable trash
      can his Mr. T bust and prance on stage in a business suit? 

      We got Fangz set up pretty quickly. All I did was some physical stuff.
      Meanwhile, Jon changed the gateway, DNS server and IP address
      himself because there are some interesting twists to Fangz. Then he
      spent the next few hours waiting for the Capture the Flag/BOFH
      contest to start by changing a few more things on Fangz, like the
      process control tables for the "mv" and "cat" commands. Oh, you say
      you never heard of Red Hat Linux "process control tables"? Muhahaha.

      Then... Priest pays me a visit. Priest. He's a tall middle aged guy whose
      trademark is the loud Hawaiian shirts and shorts he wears at every Def
      Con. At Def Con 5 he won his "I am the Fed" T-shirt by showing off an
      FBI badge. Of course I believe everything I see.

      "Carolyn," he gestures to me. He sidles up close and whispers, "I left the
      agency a few weeks ago. An Internet startup in California offered me a
      chance to get rich. I have a nondisclosure agreement for you.
      Interested?"

      Of course I like to get rich, too. I sincerely believe that Internet startups
      like to offer FBI agents tons of money. "Sure."

      Meanwhile the Capture the Flag/BOFH game has finally gotten started.
      Less than 100 of the 3,600 Def Con attendees have signed up to play
      the game. What? Less than one hundred? I ask several players. They all
      say there are perhaps only 200 people at Def Con who actually know
      how to break into computers. The rest? Feds, narcs, groupies, and
      fakes. And BOFHs:):)

      Suddenly people start shouting. I turn to see a man prancing on top of a
      table next to the Penguin Palace booth. He is naked except for an
      extremely tiny g-string. It's a good thing his genitals are tiny enough to fit
      into it. Then he pulls on his jeans and leads a parade of drooling
      teenagers out of the room.

      A tiny waisted bleached blonde with braless boobs in a spaghetti string
      shirt prances over to some Capture the Flag players. Not only is each
      boob the size of her head, they are powered by antigravity devices.
      From time to time she pulls up her shirt and sticks her naked boobs into
      the faces of the players. They keep on shooing her off -- "We're trying
      to hack, dammit!" 

      (to be continued: groupies get drunk and laid; Feds, narcs and Cult of the
      Dead Cow urge code kiddies to hack more government Web sites so
      Congress will boost the Information Warfare budget from $1 billion to
      $1.4 billion; fangz LARTs hackers; Michael Schiffman beefs up his
      muscles with a bicycle pump; Shipley remains fangless; Priest attempts
      an entrapment scheme; and Granny Operator from Heck gets into
      trouble.)

                                          


      Granny Hacker Visits Defcon - Part 2

      LetÆs see, where was I. Oh, yes, the lady with the giant breasts
      powered by antigravity machines is trying to distract people playing the
      Capture the Flag game against the Bastard Operator from Hell
      contestants. All the BOFHers are unscathed so far. IÆm standing next to
      my box, every now and then checking to make sure at least a half dozen
      people have spawned shells in the guest ac count. I want Fangz to get a
      real workout! And who should sidle over but Priest, the giant guy in the
      buzz cut sandy hair and loud Hawaiian shirt who says he is ôno longer
      with the agency.ö Out of the corner of his mouth he mutters to me, ôDis
      has been committing too many felonies. If Dis doesnÆt watch out, he will
      go to jail.ö

      Dis. ThatÆs one of the two or three hundred handles Brian Martin uses,
      but who knows, lots of other hackers may use it, too. Or maybe Priest
      just keeps on confusing Dis with Mitnick or someone like that. I mutter
      right back, ôItÆs not clear to me that Dis is committing any felonies.ö

      Hoo, boy, now this is getting interesting. First Priest hints that he can
      make me rich, then he appeals to my presumed desire for revenge. Lots
      of people assume that since I am Brian MartinÆs number one obsession
      (as seen at http://attrition.org), that I must hate him. Au contraire! Today
      is honesty day, no more kidding around. Martin is my public relations
      man, working overtime year after year to make sure everyone has heard
      of and buys my book, The Happy Hacker. By publicizing his fictional
      accounts of how I hacked 303.org and sekurity.org and let us NOT
      FORGET the New York Times, Martin has persuaded countless
      teenagers that I am a brilliant evil genius granny.

      Oh, while we are on the topic of honesty, Priest just emailed me to
      advise that he just might sue me for the first installment of Granny
      Hacker from Heck Goes to Def Con. LetÆs see, what are his exact
      words, ôI have to talk to my lawyer about a lawsuit...I at no time
      represented my self as an FBI agent nor did I ever display a 'badge' at
      Defcon 5 to get a Fed t-shirt. Further, at no time did I aproach you with
      an offer of employment or a commentary on what my orgainzation was
      doing.ö Hmmm, another man from an alternate universe. I think his
      alternate universe is at http://www.exo.com, phone them up and they
      will give you a truly amazing shell account from which you can entertain
      yourself with the file permissions of the other users.
      
      LetÆs see if I have this straight. Priest, a fictional entity who ran Def
      Con 7, and who has variously claimed to be an FBI agent and involved
      in a get rich quick Internet startup scheme, is trying to figure out how to
      sue the Granny Hacker from Heck for a humorous article that has lots
      of witnesses. If you have any leads on this manÆs true identity, or want
      to add to reports of who this man has claimed to be from time to time,
      please contact me at 505-281-9675. ôDonÆt pay attention to the man
      behind the curtain...ö
      
      Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming, Friday July 9. Jon
      takes a turn guarding Fangz, our Bastard Operator From Hell
      contestant. I go to the main ballroom to catch the first round of ôSpot the
      Fed.ö I pass a room out of which rock music booms. There are fog
      machines, spotlights waving about. I notice more young women than I
      had ever before seen at a Def Con, mostly beautiful, dancing with
      hackers in that party room. More gorgeous women lounge in the
      hallway, awkwardly flirting and beckoning. Are they hoping to marry the
      next Bill Gates? They certainly donÆt have the look of Las Vegas
      prostitutes, not even the lady with the antigravity boobs. ThereÆs
      intelligence in those eyes. I briefly think of Tracy Baldwin, a new FBI
      agent, who came to Albuquerque for her first assignment out of
      Quantico. BaldwinÆs young, beautiful, tense like a coiled spring. Some of
      these women in the hallway remind me of her. 
      
      Oh, yes, last November I gave Baldwin a hard time when she tried to
      convince me she might arrest me if I didnÆt take a lie detector test about
      whether I hacked the New York Times. So now she gets to put up with
      being in a Granny Hacker story.
      
      In the ballroom, Priest is on stage with a microphone. He booms out,
      ôTo win your æI spotted the FedÆ T-shirt, you have to identify someone
      who carries a badge and has the power to arrest. Informers donÆt count.
      You know how you spot an informer, donÆt you? HeÆs someone who
      was raided and got back out on the street within 24 hours.ö
      
      That made me think. A story in Forbes magazine last January had
      reported that the FBI had raided Brian Martin -- yet had not arrested
      him. According to an employee of the Internet Service Provider Martin
      uses (Inficad), not long thereafter ôWe were served a subpoena by the
      Fed's to perform certain actions on the attrition box co-located at our
      facility. As we do with all law enforcement matters we complied, and
      they performed what was required and permitted under the subpoena.ö
      
      Many in that room know about MartinÆs FBI raid. Some in that room
      remember Priest claiming to be a Fed. Why would a Fed, even an
      ex-Fed (if Priest was telling me the truth) be trying to publicly finger
      Martin as a supposed informant? All in good fun, IÆm sure.
      
      A young man sitting next to me leans over. ôWho is this Priest guy? He
      seems to be running Def Con.ö 
      
      I dunno, maybe being a ficticious character is his profession.
      
      ###
      
      Near midnight I am hovering over a laptop and hear a voice booming,
      ôYou. WeÆre closing down for the night. Out. Now.ö I look up and see a
      knot of hackers scurrying for the nearest exit, behind them Priest playing
      the role of Nazi SS man. He swivels, points with outstretched arm at the
      next nearest group. ôYou. Out. Now.ö He strides to another group. 
      ôYou. Out. Now.ö 
      
      I am amazed. ArenÆt hackers supposed to be anti-authoritarian? IsnÆt
      herding hackers like herding cats? Not here.
      
      Oops, IÆm wrong. A departing group breaks up and scatters rather than
      making it to the exit. Priest catches on within seconds. He points them
      out one by one: ôI told you, out. Now.ö
      
      When he has cleared the room of all but those of use playing the hacker
      war game, he comes over to us, now relaxed.
      
      I gesture at Fangz. ôI donÆt want to leave until everyone else is out of
      the room. I worry about physical sabotage of my Bastard Operator from
      Hell entry.ö
      
      ôNo problem.ö 
      He lets me be the last non-staff person out.
      
      ###
      
      Saturday morning. July 10, 1999. IÆm waiting by the pool for the con to
      reopen. A swarthy fellow speaks. ôCarolyn, IÆm a friend of Zyklon.ö
      
      ôCan you tell me just why, when he hacked the White House Web site,
      he called me a crack whore?ö
      
      ôIÆll ask. By the way, I have your Happy Hacker book. Loved it.ö

      I canÆt resist plugging my book. Buy out the latest printing, folks, and
      maybe IÆll shut up. Maybe not:)

      ###

      The hacking game is in full swing. A dumpy little fellow comes over to
      me. ôHi, remember I called you on the phone? IÆm a reporter from
      Rolling Stone. Can you tell me why so many hackers hate you so much?
      They wonÆt ever tell me why, they just say æCarolyn sucks.Æö

      ôThey donÆt all hate me, just some noisy ones. Why donÆt you talk to
      these young people?ö I introduce him to a group of teenage boys who
      have clustered around me to get hints about my entry in the game:
      ôFangz.ö Stuff like I tell them to use the pasv command to make its ftp
      server work. Sorry, Fangz is a little primitive, but the fewer features on
      its services, the harder it is to hack. Hey, give us credit, itÆs RFC
      compliant and at least we donÆt force players to use tftp, or cut and
      paste stuff through a terminal emulation program!

      The teens crowd around the reporter. ôTell people most hackers are
      good guys! We donÆt commit crime! We make the Internet a better
      place!ö they chorus.

      A tall, thin young man in skinhead garb and haircut walks up and hands
      me a flyer. It is about the new Web site, ôNetcriminals.org.ö It has a
      fake dossier on me, along with fake dossiers for several other people.
      Skinhead asks, ôDo you know who I am?ö

      I shake my head.
      He gives a tight grin. ôNetmask.ö

      Netmask. It is the first time we have met in real life, yet over the years
      he has occasionally sent me demented, obscene, yet humorous emails.
      Some people might say he must be my kind of guy, but ask my fellow
      choir memebers at St. Luke, IÆm just a sweet old lady.

      Anyhow, Netmask and I had spoken once on the phone, or perhaps I
      should say, had spoken once that he had admitted to being Netmask. His
      erotic fantasies remind me of the man, or group, that has done major
      damage to almost every Internet Service Provider I had ever used:
      GALF. NetmaskÆs Web site -- 303.org -- features pictures of his 303
      gang mowing down aspen trees with machine guns, dancing around a
      table covered with exotic guns, firebombing a car, and at one time it
      included instructions that presumably were meant as a humorous parody
      on instructions on how to molest children (under cocksoldier.com, hosted
      on the same box). They live near the Columbine school district near
      Denver. 

      Netmask runs the kind of gang that could make reporters go nuts for a
      chance to interview him. I can see the headline, ôGoth gun and bomb nut
      hackers run rampant in Columbine school district.ö But I will resist the
      temptation to write lurid stuff about them, just check out
      http://www.303.org for yourself, if it is still up.

      Just before Def Con, Netmask had emailed me, ôYou up for a little
      hacker death match with me on friday? (at con)ö

      I replied, ôSure on death match, if you'll talk with me afterward. My aim
      might be off, I'm used to beating up outlaw horses with well-aimed
      kicks, the half ton class opponent is kinda exhilarating. Haven't sparred
      with a human in a long time. Dunno why humans are afraid of me :):)ö I
      was just kidding, I swear! I just give wild horses ôlove tapsö when they
      attack me, is all.

      Hacker Death Match. That consists of putting on bulky foam rubber
      ôsumo suitsö and trying to knock each other down or out of the ring.
      Netmask had emailed back, ôIm gonna pass on this actually.... Keeps
      me out of the media.. and keeps you less in the media..ö

      Just now I am wearing karate shoes. ItÆs my Deadly Granny outfit.
      Make muggers quake in their boots when they see me. Netmask is
      staring at them. The karate shoes, I mean. His martial art is kick boxing.
      He looks up. We stare at each other awhile. Then I lean forward within
      six inches of his face and whisper, ôThe reason I respect you, is you
      arenÆt a crybaby like the others.ö

      He ducks and rushes off. 

      ###

      Two PM. I had gotten press credentials earlier that day from an elderly
      oriental man so I could get into the front row with a tape recorder to
      cover the Cult of the Dead Cow. They are about to introduce their new
      program to enable people to break into computers: Back Orifice 2000.
      Priest gets up on stage to announce their imminent arrival. A voice
      shouts out, ôThere have been a lot of naked people here. IsnÆt that
      against the law?ö

      Priest laughs. ôThis is Las Vegas.ö
      Another voice shouts, ôWhat happens to the people who are running
      around naked?ö
      Priest points at him. ôThey get laid!ö
      The audience roars with laughter. 

      Priest continues, ôWe have a treat for you tonight, live rock music.ö
      Priest leaves the stage to cheers.

      The lights dim, then go out. From big speakers on stage come sounds of
      a storm, mooing of cows and an adult voice ordering a kid over and over
      again to put the cows in the barn. The mooing gradually grows ominous,
      then ridiculously loud. 

      Rock music breaks out as two spotlights shine on each side of the stage.
      They project the logo of the Cult of the Dead Cow -- a cow skull in
      black against a white cross. The logos rotate. In the center of the stage
      a video projects themes of cattle interspersed with intimidating images
      from Nazi and Maoist social realistic art. Then, to cheers, the Cult of the
      Dead Cow gang enters from right stage, hurling glowing disks out to the
      audience. Nineteen of the twenty cult members prance, slouch and/or
      stagger up on stage. In front of them, their master of ceremonies leaps
      about in a ratty white fur coat, synthetic fur chaps, a belt made of
      handcuffs, doing a sick parody of a Pentecostal preacher, grabbing his
      crotch, making obscene jokes, and leading the audience in chants of
      (him)ôDead!ö (audience) ôCow! (him) ôKiss! (audience) ôAss!ö The
      rising lights reveal a parody of church vestments, banners with a
      Christian cross with the dead cow symbol in the center hanging on each
      side of the stage.

      He raises both hands over his head, palms toward the audience. ôEvery
      eight year old can hack shit! Hacking to save the world! Just donÆt get
      fucking busted! And use a fucking spell checker!ö Long cheering and
      laughter come from the crowd.

      ôAnd now, the man who wrote Back Orifice 2000 -- Dildog!ö 

      Dildog describes the features as if it is merely a ôremote administration
      toolö as he calls it, raising snickers from the crowd. He uses LCD
      projectors from both a ôclientö (attacker) and ôserverö (victim)
      computer to show how BO2000 hides itself. When he shows the option
      to disable the victim mouse and keyboard and allow the attackerÆs
      mouse and keyboard to control the victim, the crowd cheers.

      They end the show with a man in red lace tights, shorts and red pasties
      held on with duct tape (who looks like a near terminal AIDS victim)
      shimmying across the stage while Deth Vegetable -- a gigantic
      sumo-style man in shorts -- smashes computers and a monitor with an
      electric guitar, the Master of Ceremonies waving his hands and
      screaming as he fires roman candles from a tube he clenches with his
      thighs against his crotch.

      Afterwards I go back to the press room to check for schedule changes.
      Somehow I have the premonition that Brian MartinÆs talk ôfakes walk
      among usö may be rescheduled. David Akin of the Canadian publication
      ôNational Postö approaches me as I am leaving and asks ôWhy do so
      many hackers hate you? They wonÆt tell me anything specific. Basically
      they just say æCarolyn sucks.Æö 

      Just then a disheveled man in an Attrition.org black T-shirt strides up
      yelling, ôGet out of here. Only press are allowed here.ö
      ôI have a press pass.ö I show it to him.
      ôYou arenÆt a legitimate reporter! Get out of here.ö
      ôHow many FUCKing hundreds of magazine articles do I have to write
      before you admit I am a reporter?ö Oops, I said a bad word. IÆm
      mortified.
      ôWeÆll consider you a reporter when you write real information!ö
      ôReal information! Your Attrition.org site is full of libel!ö

      Just then the woman in charge of the press room, followed by several
      reporters, comes out and yells at me, ôThe conference staff says you
      are not a reporter. Give back your press pass. Now.ö

      Akin turns to them, ôYou canÆt do this! You canÆt pull a reporterÆs
      credentials just because you donÆt like what he or she writes!ö

      Somehow Priest materializes. ôCome with me, I have some information
      for you.ö We go into a deserted room. Chairs are stacked high. I canÆt
      believe I am actually thinking this, but the first thing that comes to mind
      is that this will make a great scene for the ôGranny Hacker Sticks it to
      the FBIö movie.

      Priest breaks the spell. ôThe press room incident. It never happened.ö
      ôWhat?ö
      ôWe are explaining it to the reporters. They understand it was no big
      deal. You will never speak of this incident again.ö
      ôNo way.ö

      Puzzlement flashes across his face. He must be realizing that his
      nondisclosure agreement ploy has failed. ôIf you talk to a reporter about
      this, I will throw you out of the con. You *will* tell them it never
      happened.ö

      ôOne problem. I donÆt lie.ö I begin to tremble. ôI ... have ... my ...
      integrity.ö Priest rubs his chin. I glare at him. He takes a deep breath.
      Time for a different ploy. ôYou donÆt have to worry about Attrition.org.
      We have discredited them with the media. Brian Martin is on his way
      out.ö

      I look at him, head tilted, puzzled.
      ôA few months ago Brian Martin tried to get me fired.ö
      ôUh, huh.ö
      ôWe were talking on Internet Relay Chat. On condition of
      confidentiality. He sent a transcript of the conversation to my boss. Got
      me in major trouble.ö
      ôAll he did was violate confidentiality? Sheesh, he didnÆt alter the
      transcript?ö
      ôHe altered the transcript. Fortunately I had my version burned into a
      CD-ROM. Also, two others had eavesdropped on our chat and burned
      their transcripts to CD-ROM, too. Ours all agreed.ö

      I nodded. Yeah, right. How come there are always so many fantastic
      stories revolving around Brian Martin and Attrition.org? We ought to
      nominate attrition.org for a Hugo award at the next World Science
      Fiction Convention. Or is Priest the one who deserves the Hugo? Priest
      continues. ôI want Martin behind bars. You know he was busted for the
      New York Times hack. Then immediately released. HeÆs now an
      unpaid informant.ö

      I let out a long breath. If Priest is telling the truth -- a BIG assumption --
      Martin is now too valuable for the agency to expend. ôIÆve heard that
      Martin is ops (moderator) on three Global Hell IRC channels. So was he
      the one who got Zyklon busted for the White House hack?ö

      Priest shrugs.
      ôIs he informing on Global Hell?ö
      He throws up his hands. ôWe have so much on our plates we canÆt even
      pay attention to Global Hell.ö
      ôBut they claim to be the ones hacking so many of those government
      Web sites.ö
      ôYou have no idea of what we are contending with.ö

      Internet startup. Get rich. Yeah, right, I hate it when people forget to
      stick to their stories. I reply, ôI have a problem with your informant. I
      had to shut down our Happy Hacker IRC server when Martin got on it.
      It is my opinion that he may have been encouraging kids to commit
      crime. I am not operating a breeding ground for crime. IÆm not going to
      bring Happy Hacker IRC back up until I get a more reliable group of
      moderators.ö

      ôContributing to the delinquency of minors is a crime. Bring your IRC
      server back up and we can get Martin behind bars.ö
      ôHow?ö
      ôYour network is located in Texas. Under Texas state law, even though
      Martin and any kid he involves in crime are both out of state, if
      discussions about committing a crime happened on a computer within
      Texas, thatÆs conspiracy. TheyÆll extradite both parties.ö
      ôI canÆt do that. I will not expend some teenager to put Martin behind
      bars. I will not bring up our IRC server until I can make sure we can
      keep the criminals off.ö And, I thought, not until we can keep FBI agent
      provocateurs out.
      ôSo, am I going to have to kick you out of the conference?ö
      ôMy publisher would be overjoyed. Great publicity. Believe it or not, two
      independent groups have approached me about doing a movie. Getting
      kicked out would be a GREAT dramatic device.ö Oh, man, I can almost
      taste the Granny Hacker from Heck movie!
      ôBut what do you want?ö
      ôI want to stay. I want to see if Fangz can win the Bastard Operator
      from Hell contest. But even if it does, I presume the conference
      organizers will come up with an excuse to deny us the prize.ö
      ôYes, but at least you will know you won.ö

      When I return to the game, I see someone at the console of Fangz.
      ôExcuse me, thatÆs my computer. The rules say you have to hack it
      remotely, not from console.ö

      ôI was just checking to see whether it was broken.ö He goes back to
      messing with the console of the computer next to Fangz, his entry in the
      Bastard Operator from Hell contest. A fat man with disheveled black
      hair and ragged beard and sloppy clothes joins him. The disheveled man
      slides a CD-ROM into the drive. They are violating the rules by
      changing their operating system. Again.

      A little later I see Priest walking by. I run over and hail him. ôExcuse
      me, what is your real name?ö

      He pauses in mid stride, looking so off balance I wonder if he might fall.
      His mouth flaps open and shut. Finally he sputters, ôYou must be
      kidding.ö 
      ôI thought it was worth a try.ö

      He falls back into his fast stride and disappears into the crowd. Poor
      Priest, he doesnÆt realize yet that he has just persuaded an investigative
      reporter, yes, the Granny Reporter from Heck, to learn everything she
      can about him, stuff like his .bash_history (real hackers use tcsh) and
      maybe even his real name.

      ###

      To be continued: JonÆs lightning reflexes keep Joltcan.c exploit from
      DOSing Fangz; Michael Schiffman beefs up his muscles with a bicycle
      pump; fat guy who keeps on changing the operating system for his
      BOFH entry howls with rage about how mean and nasty Fangz is when
      people try to break in (recorded in real-audio, to be available from this
      web site); Granny Hacker from Heck gets into trouble, but a giant
      Texan interior decorator rescues her.



      Granny Hacker Visits Def Con - Part 3 
      Thursday, July 22, 1999 at 0:01:12
      by Carolyn Meinel - Writing For AntiOnline 

      Saturday, July 10, 1999. After dinner, I return to take a turn guarding
      Fangz. Jon points to a stain on the linen covering the table where Fangz
      sits. ôSomeone tried to kill it by pouring a can of Jolt at the keyboard.
      Also, the power has been turned off four times since you left. They are
      getting ugly.ö He laughs. ôI let someone reboot into single user mode as
      root. He changed the root password to æcrackwhore.Æ He was pissed
      when he rebooted and couldnÆt get into root over the network.ö

      Oh, yes, I knew what that was all about. He had set it up so root from
      console couldnÆt write to the password file. We both snicker. Then I
      grow sober thinking of the hazards of people frequently turning off our
      power. The operating system we use can sometimes be destroyed if the
      power goes off while a file is being written to the disk. Kernel panic!

      Some hackers gather around me talking about the latest Web site hacks.
      They say the Defcon.org site is down because someone defaced it with
      parodies of the Antionline and Happy Hacker web sites. I didnÆt do it!
      Honest! Um, John, what about you?

      They have an even better story about why MartinÆs Attrition.org site is
      down for Def Con. Somehow the title of the index.html page changed to
      ôTemple of Hate.ö ThatÆs what AntionlineÆs John Vranesevich and I
      like to call it. Then, mysteriously, just after it sprouted the ôTemple of
      Hateö slogan, Attrition.org went down.

      (Later Martin explained that his webmaster had changed the name on
      purpose, that it wasnÆt hacked, honest! And, just by coincidence, a hard
      drive failed right after the ôTemple of Hateö headline went up. Just by
      coincidence, as soon as they got Attrition.org up again, they decided to
      change the headline to ôWe are the people our parents warned us
      about.ö I didnÆt do it! I swear! Repeat after me, ôHacking Web sites is
      childish.ö Besides, why would I hack my own publicist?)

      At fifteen minutes before 10 PM, Priest comes in to shut down the
      room. ôYou. Out. Now.ö Hackers meekly file to the doors.

      I go to my hotel room at the Hard Rock hotel across the street, and
      change into a short red velvet dress and black tights. This is for the
      formal ôBlack and Whiteö ball, then sashay back to the Alexis hotel. IÆm
      glamorous granny now, honest!

      In the lobby, two of the Trumpbour brothers greet me. They thank me
      for bringing our Happy Hacker Wargame team and some computers to
      their Summercon hacker gathering a month previously. ôDef Con has a
      bad atmosphere. We like to keep our con pleasant.ö 

      I thank them for keeping alive the ideal of true hacking. Folks, if you go
      to just one hacker con next year, try Summer Con. It's run by real
      hackers, people who use their real names, not a bunch of fictitious
      characters such as Priest. Speak of the devil, Priest walks by just now
      dressed like a priest. I flash him my winningest smile, but he acts like he
      doesnÆt see me.

      I begin walking through the lobby toward the Def Con ballroom. A voice
      behind me yells, ôCarolyn! Why did you tell the FBI that I hacked the
      New York Times?ö 

      I turn and see a man so muscular that he looks like a bicycle pump has
      inflated him. By contrast, his narrow head sits on a skinny neck. He is
      wearing a tank top that shows off his tattoos. His muscles quiver with
      what I suspect might be rage. Behind and beside him is a crowd of kids
      that look like they average fourteen years of age. They goggle at us like
      spectators at a bull fight.

      I scan the group. I donÆt recognize any of them. ôExcuse me, but I donÆt
      believe we have met.ö

      Mr. Steroids says, ôWe have met. Several times. Think.ö

      I scratch my head, rub my chin. I simply canÆt think of having ever met
      anyone who gives the impression of being seriously pumped on steroids.
      I study his face. Steroids shouldnÆt change that too much. Still doesnÆt
      ring a bell. ôGive me a hint.ö

      ôYou know me. You told the FBI I hacked the New York Times.ö

      I wonder if the FBI had tried to force him to become an informant. Did
      some agents do to him exactly what they did to me, claiming to have
      evidence that they really didnÆt have? When they came after me for
      supposedly hacking the New York Times, I had told them to, um
      ôfwordö themselves. Seriously, I am against computer crime and am
      happy to help the FBI catch criminals. But I refuse to be an undercover
      informant and I oppose the use of undercover informants. 

      OK, time for major soapbox speech here. IMNSHO, our taxpayer
      money should not fund the FBI to run around encouraging computer
      crime all in the name of some undercover operation. But, then, maybe
      IÆm just paranoid. Maybe the FBI doesn't run Def Con. Maybe it is
      mere coincidence that Jeff Moss, who bills himself as the man who
      owns the Def Con conferences, is a full-time employee of Secure
      Computing, Inc. To be exact, the registration for Defcon.org reads: 

      DEF CON (DEFCON-DOM)

      Maybe it is coincidence that the Secure Computing web site claims that
      it ôis the market share leader in providing network perimeter security to
      the U.S. Federal government.ö
      (http://www.securecomputing.com/C_Bg_Hist_FRS.html) Maybe the
      whole Priest thing is just a guy having mostly harmless Vogon fun by
      being a fictitious FBI agent.

      IÆm wondering if the FBI really had told Mr. Steroids I had provided
      evidence against him. Is this how their Quantico academy teaches FBI
      agents to nullify recalcitrant reporters? Run around questioning, raiding
      and arresting people and telling them I provided the evidence? For once
      IÆm dead serious here. Besides Mr. Steroids, Pete Shipley and his
      dis.org gangmates Ph0n-E and Cyber say the FBI has questioned them
      at length about allegations the FBI claimed I had made against them. Do
      you know what it feels like to have weird looking guys trembling with
      anger accusing me of getting them in trouble with the FBI? But then
      again, maybe the FBI isnÆt doing anything of the sort and all these guys
      are just making up these stories.

      Anyhow, youÆre tired of my rant, so letÆs get back to the story. Serious
      mode off. Humor mode on. 

      Steroids reaches into his jeans pocket and pulls out a battered wallet.
      ôOK, IÆll give you a hint. Look at this.ö He shows me his driverÆs
      license, trembling in his hand. It says ôMichael Schiffman.ö His buddies
      draw closer, menacing. Er, as menacing as a gaggle of 13 through 15
      year olds can get. Darn, IÆm not wearing my karate shoes. They are
      staring at my 38 D bosom instead.

      I put on my best politician smile. ôMichael Schiffman, nice to meet you!ö
      Now I know who he is, a man better known as ôRouteö or ôDaemon9.ö
      He got mad at me long ago when I told my Happy Hacker mailing list
      that I opposed his hacker ezine, ôPhrack.ö In my opinion, he encourages
      people to commit senseless digital vandalism.

      ôWhy did you tell the FBI that Modify and I hacked the New York
      Times?ö

      I thought fast. I could remember telling the FBIÆs Tracy Baldwin that it
      was my opinion that there was only a 2% chance that Michael
      Schiffman could have been part of Hacking for Girliez. I had thought
      that was my way of debunking the idea he was involved. I figure it
      wonÆt do any good to tell him about the 2% bit, heÆs too mad to grasp
      nuances just now. 

      I reply, ôThe FBI told me that *I* hacked the New York Times.ö

      Schiffman puffs out a breath. He looks like an impatient school teacher
      waiting for a slow student to get the right answer. OK, a psychotic
      teacher with steroid poisoning. HeÆs shaking. ôWhy did you tell them we
      did it?ö

      ôModify hack the New York Times? Now thatÆs ridiculous. Why would
      I say that to the FBI? He couldnÆt hack his way out of a paper bag.ö

      Schiffman and company begin shouting, ôModify can so hack,ö ôCrack
      whore,ö and other brilliant intellectual observations. 

      I brilliantly retort, ôI donÆt have to listen to this.ö Would they jump me?
      Was I about to be mobbed by children while not wearing karate shoes? I
      figure I am safer acting like they could not be any threat than by taking
      a martial arts defensive stance. 

      I turn on my heel and walk away.. 

      I enter the main ballroom at midnight -- time for Hacker Jeopardy to
      start. This is a takeoff on the TV quiz show, ôJeopardy.ö To get to the
      empty seats on the far side of the ballroom, I walk around the back. In
      the middle of the back row I see a familiar face: Modify and three
      others are standing on their chairs. Are they trying to be noticed? As I
      pass them, Modify hands me a business card reading ôAttrition.org --
      We donÆt play well with others.ö Oh, yes, isnÆt that a line from the
      movie ôHackersö? Does this mean they are trying to get a movie deal,
      too, something like ôHow Attrition.org Stuck it to Priest (whoever the
      heck he is)ö? The guy standing on the chair next to Modify hisses at me,
      ôYouÆd better watch out.ö

      I stop to look over the guy who hissed at me. Yes, it must be Brian
      Martin. It has to be. He is standing next to Modify, his bosom buddy.
      But Martin, once buff, showing off his muscles with a tight T-shirt at
      previous Def Cons, has wasted away. HeÆs downright skinny now.
      Some two inches of his hairline has balded. The man is only 25 or 26, I
      think. Are those wrinkles on that sagging, emaciated face? Is that a
      stoop to his shoulders? The pressure of being my publicist, dealing with
      that non-hack of his attrition.org web site, and PriestÆs attempts to brand
      him a narc and discredit him with journalists must be wearing him down.

      Priest tromps up on stage. ôIs there anyone who needs to do anything
      before the game starts?ö

      A transvestite prances up to Priest, clad in a tiny sheath evening dress.
      Someone throws the girlie a condom. S/He lifts his/her skirt to reveal a
      red sequined jock strap that appears to be rather full, and inserts the
      condom in it. S/He wriggles off stage, a pied piper leading a gaggle of
      boys out of the ballroom.

      ###

      Sunday morning some dazed-looking guys are lounging by the pool. One
      is the fellow who is managing the entry in the Bastard Operator from
      Hell contest that sits to the right of Fangz. I walk over and give him a
      cheery hello. He and his comrades start howling, ôYour computer is
      stupid. ItÆs broken. It sucks.ö

      I ask, ôWhy?ö
      ôBecause itÆs yours.ö 
      ôBecause the C compiler is broken.ö
      I say, ôOther people have compiled programs on it. Why canÆt you?ö
      ôBecause they fixed the compiler.ö
      I say, ôThatÆs called hacking.ö

      ###

      Later that morning, there is great cheering as the Ghetto Hackers break
      into one computer, then another, then get ôhalf a hackö on a third. At 1
      PM the game is called to a close. Ghetto Hackers have won the
      ôCapture the Flagö part of the contest. Of the remaining nine computers,
      the winner in the Bastard Operator from Hell is, in theory, to be
      awarded to whomever had been running the most services. That, I hope,
      means Fangz. I notice a crowd gathering. Priest is there. I ask him, ôIs it
      OK to take down our equipment now?ö He nods. Jon and I began taking
      the system apart, unplugging the Ethernet hub, power, etc. 

      A kid from the Penguin Palace booth comes over and begins
      interviewing me on tape. ôCarolyn, your box finished the game without
      being rooted. Does this mean youÆre elite?ö
      ôNo, it just means Fangz didnÆt get rooted.ö

      The fat, disheveled guy with the box next to Fangz begins shouting,
      ôYou didnÆt get rooted because the hackers here are no good. They
      didnÆt root my box and it had plenty of holes.ö

      I reply, ôYou mean the Ghetto Hackers are no good? ThatÆs not a fair
      comparison, you kept on changing your operating system from console.ö

      ôI cheated? I had FreeBSD on it for twelve hours! People did so have
      plenty of time to try to break in!ö

      ôAre you saying the Ghetto Hackers are no good?ö

      He rubs his chin, thinking this one over. As I watch him, I suddenly
      realize who he is. Bluto, from the Popeye cartoons. Aha, I have pierced
      yet another hacker identity. Finally Bluto looks me in the eye and yells,
      ôYou cheated! Your box broke the rules! You have to be able to
      remotely administer it! ThatÆs the rules of the game!ö

      I look bewildered. ôWait, I distinctly heard them say you are *allowed*
      to administer it remotely, and forbidden to administer it from the console.
      They didnÆt say we were *required* to do remote administration.ö

      I realize a crowd has gathered. Shipley is among them. Bad sign. A
      skyscraper of a man looms to my right. ItÆs the giant Texan interior
      decorator. He holds a keyboard menacingly in his right hand, staring
      down Bluto. Good sign.

      Bluto yells again, ôCan you remotely administer this box? Answer me
      now!ö
      ôWell, um, er, it doesnÆt have secure shell, we have to telnet in to do
      anything.ö IÆm embarrassed.
      ôProve it! Create an account now!ö
      ôBut we just took the system down...ö
      ôProve it! Prove it!ö 

      Priest looms behind Bluto. HeÆs staring into my eyes. ôThatÆs it,
      Carolyn. We just used up our last chit at this hotel. Last night some
      fucking idiot tried to steal their golf cart. One more incident and they
      close down the con. You. Out. Now.ö

      I can hardly hear Priest for the shouting of Bluto, who is leaning awfully
      close and waving his arms. I make out strangled sounds like ônon RFC
      services ... broken C libraries...ö The Penguin Palace kid is still tape
      recording. The giant Texan interior decorator is still leaning over the
      table wielding FangzÆ keyboard like a weapon, in the face of Bluto. I
      hear a voice shouting, ôItÆs not fair, she isnÆt causing the disruption.ö

      Priest hisses at the kid with the recorder, ôIf you publish it, IÆll sue you.ö
      Then he stares at me. ôYou. Out. Now.ö

      I get this sinking feeling. ôDoes this mean otherwise you will strap us
      into chairs to listen to your Vogon poetry?ö

      A guy in a Def Con Goon shirt hisses, ôResistance is futile.ö

      PriestÆs eyes glaze over as he recites, ôOr I will rend thee in the
      #dc-stuff channel, see if I donÆt!ö
      My mind comes up with a ôdonÆt panicö scenario. ôActually I quite like
      your poetry.ö
      PriestÆs mouth flaps open and shut. ôYou do? Tell me more.ö
      ôEr, ... interesting rhythmic devices...ö

      The giant Texan interior decorator springs to my defense.
      ôCounterpoints ... the surrealism of the underlying metaphor...ö

      A dreamy smile softens the lumpy surface of PriestÆs face. ôSo what
      youÆre saying is I write poetry because underneath my mean callous
      heartless exterior I really just want to be loved?ö

      ôYes, yes!ö the giant Texan interior decorator and I urge him.
      ôNo, well, youÆre both completely wrong, I just write poetry to throw my
      mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief. You. Out. Now.ö
      As we exit the hotel, walking by the pool, Priest trots up and tries to
      draw me aside. ôWe need to speak privately.ö
      I think for a minute. Maybe he has reconsidered. Maybe he just wants
      me to sign that nondisclosure agreement after all and make me rich. Or
      could it be, shudder, more Vogon poetry? I gesture at Jon and the giant
      Texan interior decorator. ôWe can speak with them here.ö 
      ôNo, this is private.ö
      ôThen we canÆt talk.ö

      Jon, the giant Texan interior decorator and I pile into our rental car
      which the Happy Hacker Godfather has managed to materialize. Shipley
      is leaning into the window to snap one last picture of me. His lips part in
      a snarl. No fangs. I flash him a smile.

      Postscript: Just as I had anticipated, Priest rescheduled Brian MartinÆs
      ôFakes Walk Among USö talk. To be exact, he rescheduled it to
      dev/null (ôdevice nullö for you non-Unix wizards). Martin refused to
      take the affront passively. He gathered a handful of people by the pool
      side to recount his stories about AntionlineÆs John Vranesevich and me.
      He may win this yearÆs Hugo yet.

33.0 FidNet Causing Massive Confusion

      contributed by Space Rogue 
      There seems to be a lot of confusion around this new
      plan, proposal, draft or whatever it is regarding FidNet.
      This new Federal Intrusion Detection Network is
      designed to protect the nation's infrastructure from
      cyber attack. HNN has only been able to find parts of
      the document and have not read all 170 pages of it but
      from what we have found this network would actually
      be run by the GSA and not the FBI, it would only
      monitor government owned systems, and there is a
      provision for privacy concerns. This document is not
      finalized nor has it been officially released, until then
      this plan needs to be closely watched. (At least the
      government is doing something other than executing
      stupid search warrants.)

      U.S. backs off private monitoring
      By Maria Seminerio and Margaret Kane, ZDNN
      July 28, 1999 2:26 PM PT
      URL: 
      
      With criticism rolling in from all quarters, U.S. government officials on Wednesday backed away
      from a controversial plan to monitor private-sector networks for hacking activity. 
      
      The proposed Federal Intrusion Detection Network (FIDNET) plan, details of which were revealed
      by the New York Times Wednesday, has been in the works for at least a year, a National Security
      Council spokesman told ZDNN. The proposal for the government to monitor critical systems for
      security breaches arose out of concerns about the growing vulnerability of government computer
      networks and sensitive private-sector networks to hackers, the spokesman said. (The NSC advises
      the president on national security issues.) 
      
      But in spite of indications in a government document on the plan obtained by
      the Center for Democracy and Technology -- which indicates that private
      networks would also be watched -- the NSC spokesman denied that there is
      any plan for the surveillance of private online data. 
      
      The document outlining details of the plan says the FIDNET monitoring system
      would cover "critical government and ultimately private-sector information."
      Information gathered about network security breaches within one of the plan's
      three "pillars" -- the Department of Defense computer network, other federal
      networks and private sector networks -- "would also be shared with the other
      two pillars," according to the document. 
      
      The document coalesces with comments made by Jeffrey Hunker, senior
      director for critical infrastructure at the National Security Council, at the Black
      Hat Security Conference in Las Vegas earlier this month. "We depend on
      systems that were never meant to protect data from an organized threat," he told ZDNN. "The truth
      of the matter is that you all [the industry] own the systems that are going to be the target. It is not
      the federal government systems." 
      
      However, in an interview with ZDNN, Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel at CDT, said: "We feel
      the government should spend its resources closing the security holes that exist, rather than to watch
      people trying to break in," Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel at CDT, said in an interview. 
      
      In spite of assurances from government officials that any monitoring would be largely automated,
      somewhere down the line a person would have to step into the process, Dempsey said -- and this is
      where such a system could be abused. 
      
      The government document detailing the plan acknowledges that "trained, experienced analysts" will
      have to step in to determine the nature of any suspected security breaches. 
      
      Looking for 'anomalous activities'
      But the NSC spokesman said the government does not plan to monitor private networks or read
      e-mail messages, but rather to "look for anomalous activities" such as evidence of denial of service
      attacks on military and other government networks. 
      
      This was little comfort to civil libertarians and other high-tech industry watchers, who blasted the
      plan as an Orwellian attack on privacy. 
      
      "I think this is a very frightening proposal," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American
      Civil Liberties Union, in an interview. "The FBI has abused its power in the past to spy on political
      dissenters. This type of system is ripe for abuse," Steinhardt said. 
      
      "I think the threats (of network vulnerability) are completely overblown," said David Sobel, general
      counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, in an interview. The perceived security threat
      is leading to "a Cold War mentality" that threatens ordinary citizens' privacy, Sobel said. 
      
      "The most serious concern about this is that it could move us closer to a surveillance society," said
      Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, in an interview. "It's
      critical that if they do this, they should not retain any of the information that is gathered."

      Reno Calls For Ban Of Encryption Products On The Net 

      By Staff, Newsbytes
      WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 
      28 Jul 1999, 5:16 PM CST
 
      Attorney General Janet Reno, long-known for her opposition to the export of strong encryption products, has called for an
      outright ban of the distribution of such software via the Internet, according to a German publication. 
 
      The German magazine Telepolis printed what it said was a letter Reno sent last May to German Federal Secretary of
      Justice Herta Daeubler- Gmelin. The letter calls for the addressing of "risks posed by electronic distribution of encryption
      software." 
 
      "Although the Wassenaar Nations have now reached agreement to control the distribution of mass market encryption
      software of certain cryptographic strength," Reno wrote, "some Wassenaar Nations continue not to control encryption
      software that is distributed over the Internet, either because the software is in the `public domain' or because those nations
      do not control distribution of intangible items." 
 
      "While I recognize that this issue is controversial, unless we address this situation, use of the Internet to distribute
      encryption products will render Wassenaar's controls immaterial," Reno concluded in the letter. 
 
      The 1996 Wassenaar Arrangement restricts the export of high-tech equipment that can be used for military purposes to
      countries of proliferation concern, like Iran, Iraq and Libya. 
 
      Reno's letter came as a "thank you" to Daeubler-Gmelin's and Germany's efforts to "achieve a fair resolution on encryption
      products" at a Wassenaar plenary session last December. 
 
      (Note: Translation of the letter provided by NY Architects, http://jya.com ) 
 
      Reno's proposal, if enacted eventually, would mean the end of Internet-enabled distribution of all software products using
      encryption, including highly popular Web browsers from companies like America Online's Netscape and Microsoft. Any
      communications products using encryption would also be banned from Internet distribution. 
 
      The attorney general's comments take her recent congressional testimony against the Security and Freedom through
      Encryption (SAFE) Act, H.R. 850, one step farther. 
 
      SAFE's intent is to allow the widespread availability of strong encryption for export. Specifically, the bill would relax the
      White House's controls on encryption export policy, and would make strong encryption products available in the US mass
      market available for export. H.R. 850 would also extend the relaxation of policies to other encryption-related computer
      products. 
 
      In testimony earlier this month before the House Armed Services Committee, Reno restated an earlier claim that while
      encryption provides many important benefits to society, "the good of society requires narrow exceptions to this normal
      expectation of privacy." 
 
      Reno also predicted crime prevention would become much more difficult if the bill is passed, because the process to
      unscramble encrypted messages without the recovery key would be very complex. 
 
      "That, to me, is an unacceptable result, and we must not allow it to happen," Reno added. 
 
      Reno also asked for support and funding of a centralized technical resource - "a `Technical Support Center,'" as Reno called
      it - within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Such a center would support federal, state and local law enforcement in
      developing tools and techniques to respond to public threats caused by terrorists and criminals who use encryption.

      TELEPOLIS, 27 July 1999 
      
      The USA urges ban of encryption products on the Internet 
      
      Janet Reno pressures Herta DΣubler-Gmelin 
      
      By Christiane Schulzki-Haddouti   
      
      The Federal Cabinet ended the smoldering uncertainties in the German encryption policy at the beginning of June with publication of five key points. However, the
      encryption debate is not ended. In the next year a further Wassenaar round of negotiations will be on the table. The US is already trying now to persuade changes in
      positions. For the US the liberal export politics of the Europeans is a thorn in the eye. It therefore tries to close the last gaps. 
      
      At the end of May US Attorney General Janet Reno requested in a letter (below) that Federal Secretary of Justice Herta DΣubler-Gmelin control distribution of coding
      software which is becoming common "over the Internet." In addition it also positions "Public Domain" products. Reno's view is that the "use of the Internet to distribute
      encryption products will render Wassenaar's controls immaterial." At the end of year 2000 the Wassenaar agreement is to be negotiated; it regulates among other things
      the export of encyption products. Until then the USA wants with the 33 Wassenaar member states to develop a broad consent. 
      
      It is strange that the letter was addressed to the Federal Department of Justice and not to the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs, which, together with the Federal
      Ministry of the Interior, is responsible for encryption policy. The Americans probably well-know that the responsibilities are distributed within the German Federal
      Government. Therefore it is to be accepted that they figure a discussion with the Ministry of Justice has a larger chance of success. 
      
      The Federal Department of Justice did not want to confirm to Telepolis the existence of the letter. From the outside the ministry it means, however, it already has given
      several letters of the same request. It is now working on a letter in reply. However, it is not well-known whether the answer to Reno's unjustified demand is to fail. Arne
      Brand of the virtual local association of the SPD is annoyed about the "concealment policy" of the Federal Government: 
      
           "a cover broad I nevertheless only over a thing out, if I do not have an own point of view, but me the line of others to attach would like". 
      
      Encryption export policy as politico-economic instrument 
      
      Also, Hubertus Soquat, adviser in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs, did not want to confirm the existence of the letter; he nevertheless referred Telepolis to
      the basis of the encyryption benchmark figures adopted by the cabinet as clearly a position: "possibly the demand" the American placed into that the area to adjust in the
      future also encryption products in the "Public Domain" category to counter German encryption policy, which is based on the free availability of encryption products. 
      
      The free availability covers the range from development up to use by the user. The Federal Government cannot therefore meet "possible American demands." Soquat is
      convinced of the fact that "encryption export policy is being handled as a politico-economic instrument of the USA, at least." 
      
      Thomas Roessler, spokesperson of the "Foerdervereins information technology and society " (FITUG), sees the Reno letter as an attempt to keep "electronic interception
      capabilities of American and allied authorities in force for as long as possible." He says that such export control would have absurd consequences: 
      
           "A computer journal, which contains a supplement CD-ROM on free cryptographic software, might not be sold at the kiosk anymore, or only by license to
           certain foreign customers. Also the publication of free cryptographic software for general access over the Internet would no longer be easily possible." 
      
      Besides, says Roessler, already the 1998 results of negotiation would contradict which cryptographic mass market software to export control, the actual purpose of the
      Wassenaar agreement. This consists of contributing "to regional and international security and stability as transparency and larger responsibility with the transfer by
      conventional weapons and dual-use goods and - technologies promoted and thereby destabilizing accumulations of such - goods and weapons are prevented." Besides
      "bona fide" civilian transactions are not to be obstructed. Roessler: 
      
           "Today, the use of strong cryptography is the best course of action, it interacts with the controlled transactions obviously in bona fide civil transactions. 
      
      The conception that an internationally destabilizing imbalance of military strength can be caused by free or mass market available encryption software, is "absurd."
      Reno's letter has to do nothing with the avowed goals of the Wassennaar agreement, "however, but with the attempt to keep in force the electronic surveillance
      capabilities of American and allied authorities," says Roessler. 
      
      Based on information of the "Electronics Frontiers Australia " (EFA) the export of "Public Domain" crypto software is already now forbidden in Australia, the USA,
      New Zealand, France and Russia, since these states do not use "the general software note" of the Wassenaar agreement. A reason is not well-known the EFA. Ingo
      Ruhmann of the "forum computer scientist inside for peace and social responsibility " (FifF) regards the attempt of Reno to subject encyption systems of stronger control
      as "thoughtless handling of essential fundamental rights of democratic states." 
      
      Already it is now foreseen that the "general software note" will play a central role in the Wassenaar preliminaries. An avowed goal of the USA is to prevent the
      download of encryption programs over the Internet. Also the treatment of "Public Domain" encryption software will be a topic. Still there are arguments about the
      definition of the term "Public of Domain." The Wassenaar agreement describes it as software which was made available "without restrictions on its further distribution."
      From a legal view it designates, however, goods, which are free from copyright rights. Critically: According to the wording it is sufficient to exclude a further spread on
      CD or without documentation so that a software no more than is not regarded "into the public domain." Is looked for now a definition for a product, which is everyone
      accessible and freely available.

      Federal Secretary of Justice Herta DΣubler-Gmelin at the end of May 
      
      Dear Minister DΣubler-Gmelin: 
      
      I wish to thank you and your Government for your efforts to achieve a fair resolution regarding multilateral export controls on encryption products at the recent
      Wassenaar plenary session on December 2-3, 1998. While no Nation, including the United States, was completely satisfied, I think we made significant progress toward
      a regime that can support the interests of national security and public safety in the face of the challenges posed by the increasing use of encryption internationally. Given
      the divergent cryptography policies that the Wassenaar Nations have supported in the past, and the continuing controversy that cryptography policy continues to
      generate, that 33 Nations managed to find common ground augurs well for our future ability to find solutions that satisfy the divergent needs of privacy, electronic
      commerce, national security, and public safety. 
      
      Much work remains to be done. In particular, I believe we must soon address the risks posed by electronic distribution of encryption software. Although the Wassenaar
      Nations have now reached agreement to control the distribution of mass market encryption software of certain cryptographic strength, some Wassenaar Nations
      continue not to control encryption software that is distributed over the Internet, either because the software is in the "public domain" or because those Nations do not
      control distribution of intangible items. While I recognize that this issue is controversial, unless we address this situation, use of the Internet to distribute encryption
      products will render Wassenaar's controls immaterial. 
      
      I look forward to our continuing discussions on these and other issues. And again, thank you for your past and future considerations of these issues. 
      
      Sincerely, Janet Reno

      In an open field next to a lake near Altlandsberg,
      outside Berlin, Germany several thousand people are
      expected to gather under tents with their computers.
      The Chaos Computer Club Camp will be taking place next
      weekend. Along with things like a 34MBit Internet link,
      discussions on cryptography and the Linux Death Match
      one of the scheduled events may be underwater lock

      Chaos Club Takes Hackers on
      Holiday 
 
      By Mary Lisbeth D'Amico 
 
      MUNICH û Hackers looking to get away from
      it all and at the same time hone their skills,
      will set up tents in a field near Berlin next
      week as part of a three-day event
      sponsored by Germany's premier hacker
      group, the Chaos Computer Club. 
 
      "Nerds, hackers and phreaks from around the
      world," as the club calls them, are gathering
      Aug. 6 through 8 in Altlandsberg, near Berlin,
      where they will split their time between
      partying, swimming in a nearby lake and
      engaging in contests that test their hacking
      prowess. 
 
      The club will provide electricity and Ethernet
      access in every tent. A special network will
      be set up so users can practice and hook up
      to the Net. 
 
      Although press is allowed, journalists must
      be on their best behavior, the club says.
      Reporters must pay like everyone else, must
      wear a badge clearly identifying themselves,
      may not take pictures and may only quote
      those who consent to be interviewed. 
 
      Pre-registration is already closed for the
      event, according to the club Web site, but
      those that show up with 150 marks (US$82)
      can try their luck. The grounds can
      comfortably fit between 1,500 and 2,000
      people. 
 
      Business visitors û defined by a club
      publication as anyone who is "rich or working
      for a company or government that wants
      you at the camp because there is a lot to
      learn or you have a certain commercial
      interest," are asked to pay 1,500 marks
      (US$820). Spaces remain for this type of
      participant. 
 
      The camp will be divided into theme villages
      û including lock picking, cryptography and
      re-engineering û where participants can
      choose the topic that most interests them.
      A typical event will be the Linux
      Deathmatch, a real-time hacking competition
      in which teams of one to three players will
      try to hack one another. 
 
      Participants can also propose their own
      topics to the event's sponsors. One group
      has also announced a "Hack the NT"
      contest, and the lock-pickers' project is
      even eyeing "underwater lock picking in the
      lake nearby."

      Man arrested over alleged hacking offence
    
      A 19-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the alleged hacking of a Web site
      owned by a Wapping-based business premises. 
    
      The man -- who has not been named by police -- was arrested last Wednesday and
      released without charge. He was bailed to appear at Holborn Police Station in October
      pending further investigations. 
    
      It is understood the arrest was part of a special operation conducted by the Computer
      Crime Unit based at New Scotland Yard. 
    
      Last month the CurrantBun.Com Web site was hacked and the personal details of 50
      people were published on the Net. 
    
      CurrantBun.com is the portal of Britain's most popular newspaper The Sun which is based
      at Wapping, London. 
    
      David Habanec claimed responsibility for the alleged break-in at CurrantBun.com. 
    
      At the time he made no secret that he was responsible and went out of his way to court
      publicity over the alleged intrusion. 
    
      He even published details of how he carried out the breach of security. 
    
      In an exclusive interview with The Register Habanec said he did it to gain notoriety among
      the Internet community. He also alleged it was part of a revenge attack against
      Cheshire-based ISP Telinco, the company that provides the network for CurrantBun.Com.

      Shouts to GRiDMAN for suggesting the topic to me
      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=
      
      01 - Intro
      
              I don't know why it wasn't obvious for me to write about it earlier.
      Although I'm sure the major audience that will continue reading after the
      intro are script kiddies, I thought about it for a while and decided to go
      ahead with releasing it.  This white paper is geared towards people who want
      to single out a system and make an organized attack.  Rather than attacking
      a random system you found to be exploitable to a certain security flaw.  I
      hope I can be of some help to new security professionals or other hacker-type
      people or anyone else who breaks into systems.  When you plan on breaking
      into someone else's system just plan on paying the consequences if you get
      caught.  If you don't want to get caught take the necessary precautions.
      You still might get caught.
      
      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      
      02 - Web browsing
      
              After you know what system you're attacking you have to get some
      general information about the system like what platform are they running,
      what applications, things like that.  A lot of times you can do this just
      by looking through their site.  As you look through the take note of what
      it's running like if it says what operating system, what web server,
      firewall, administrative tools, or CGI scripts and remember what versions
      are being used either.  The difference between version 1.0 and 3.0 can be
      the difference between a possible attack and no attack.  FTP or telnet
      banners could also reveal information about the system.
      
      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      
      03 - Port scanning
      
              Port scanning is always a good idea whether you know anything at
      all about the system or not.  The results of a port scan can in many
      cases show you what operating system is being run.  For example a Unix
      machine wouldn't be running NetBIOS and an NT machine wouldn't be running
      mountd.  In addition to this, what Internet applications are being run
      provides different ways you can break in.  Like if you know that the
      system is Linux and is running qpop or nlock or some other exploit-able
      program then there's a possibility that you can penetrate the system that
      way.  You should keep a temporary log of all port scanning that you do so
      that you can use the information when you actually make your attack.  Here
      is an example of a very short port scan:
      
      KeyRoot Port Scanner (KeyScan) v1.0 by Mnemonic
      
      Scanning ip address 127.0.0.1 on ports 21, 23, 56
      
      Scan started 3/6/2020 1:08 am
      
      127.0.0.1
        21
        23
      
      Scan completed 3/6/2020 1:10 am
      
      KeyRoot owns you
      
      I just scanned three ports on my local machine.  Two of these ports were
      open (21 and 23).  I can pretty much assume that I am running FTP and telnet.
      Other types of scans can determine what applications are being run on
      specific ports.
      
      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      
      04 - Determining the method of penetration
      
              Now you should know just about everything you need in order to make
      an attack.  When you know what the system is running you basically know what
      it's vulnerable to.  You can run some publicly-available exploit, write your
      own exploit, or use publicly-known attacks to penetrate the system.  In many
      instances a system may be running programs that are exploitable only when
      you have an account on the system.  If that's the case you're going to need
      to get a shell some how like guessing someone's password or something like
      that.  Rooting the system means you have complete control over it.  You have
      administrator rights.
      
      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      
      05 - Making the attack
      
              Ok so now you know how to attack the system go do it.  In most cases
      when you're attacking a someone you need to be running the same platform as
      they are.  This isn't the case with null connections or with platform-to-
      anotherplatform exploits.
      
      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      
      06 - Ok that's it
      
              Ummmm... yeah... peace to all my bro's in on EFNet.  NtWaK0 and
      MostHateD and everyone else.

      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      1 - Abstract
      
              As much as I like Win98 it is totally insecure.  Programs in the root directory can
      allow remote web access.  This could mean to browse your system files with possibly
      read and write permissions, upload and download files, remotely execute code, and
      whatever else you can think of.  If your system has important files on it then you could be
      in trouble.  The Access Controls in Win98 are misleading and can allow an attacker to
      access your hard drive with read/write permissions unpassworded.  Also there is no
      encryption scheme between the network components so basically anyone can sniff your
      passwords and whatever else you type, and improper permissions allow trojan horses to
      carry out instructions with no restrictions.  All of these security issues have the potential
      of giving an attacker remote administration over your Win98 system.  The possibilities
      that come with that are endless.  This advisory goes over several security problems in the
      Win98 operating system.  I think youÆll be interested reading it.  Have fun!
      
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      2 - Root
      
              In Windows we have what is called the root directory.  This is C:\WINDOWS. 
      Files in the root directory can carry out system-wide processes that may be compromising
      to the security of the system.  Explorer.exe has been exploited in past versions to allow
      remote access to Win95/98 over the web.  In fact any program in the root directory has
      the potential of being exploited.  Sometimes programs are written without security in
      mind or maybe the programmers look over parts of the code and don't realize there's a
      problem.  There could be a buffer overflow or a poorly written function that allows
      remote browsing of databases.  If you store medical or other personal information like
      credit card numbers, addresses, or company documents then this is obviously a concern. 
      Nobody wants to wake up one morning and see that their fifteen-page paper that was
      suppose to be released tomorrow has been downloaded by a teen hacker.  Windows 98
      fails to incorporate security necessary to prevent these types of attacks.  The only thing I
      can recommend at this time is that you download a free commercial firewall that's been
      released by a respectable company other than Microsoft.
      
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      3 - TCP/IP
      
              Many of today's Windows '98 users want to share files with other computers on
      their existing network.  One of the easiest ways to do this is using the TCP/IP protocol. 
      All the user has to do is go to settings in the start menu, control panel and when Explorer
      opens up, click on the network icon.  When the network config folder opens there will be
      a list of what network components have been installed.  Just one click on TCP/IP and
      then Add.. File and print sharing.. OK and it's done.  The thing most people don't realize
      when setting up shares is that they don't stop to think or don't realize that people other
      than the intended people can also access these shares and without a password.  They
      assume that the password will be the same as their Windows logon password.  Well they
      assumed wrong.  Windows '98 provides poor configuration for networks which leaves
      them succeptible to attack to anyone on the Internet or on the network.  For example if I
      were on a network and new the ip address of the computer running shares I would open
      an MSDOS window and:
      
      C:\>net use p: \\targetip\ipc$
      The command completed successfully.
      
      C:\>net view \\targetip
      Shared resources at \\targetip
      
      
      Share name   Type         Used as  Comment
      
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ADMIN$       Disk                  Remote Admin
      C$           Disk                  C Drive                                    
      D$           Disk                  D Drive
      IPC$         IPC                   Remote IPC
      NETLOGON     Disk                  Logon server share
      HPLaser4     Printer               HP LaserJet 4si
      The command completed successfully.
      
      Basically what I just did was create a null connection with the IPC$ share and view what
      shares were on the network.  Now I can map to any of these shares like C$ and browse
      them with read/write permissions.  What this means is that I can take a look at any file on
      the system.  The access control features of Windows 98 are poorly set up and make
      misconfiguration of NetBIOS easy.  To learn more about NetBIOS check out The NT
      Wardoc by Rhino9.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      4 - Encryption
      
              You would think that in cooperation with the network components of Windows
      98 that there would be some sort of encryption between host and client but there's not.  If
      you do in fact have a password set on your shares any attacker who is sniffing the
      network can see you typing in your username and password in cleartext.  Win98 provides
      no prevention of this.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      5 - Permissions
      
              In the Windows environment there are no permissions on files by default.  The
      potential of what someone might do with access to all of the files that are a part of the
      Windows 98 operating system is risky.  They could also download a program which may
      be a virus or a trojan horse that executes instructions without any restrictions.  This can't
      be good for anyone.  Your Windows 98 computer is at risk of being compromised
      because Microsoft didnÆt pay attention and didnÆt do a clean job.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      6 - Conclusion
      
              Although Win98 provides excellent point-and-click features it is far beyond not
      being secure.  Since the update from Win 95 to Win 98 Microsoft has failed to improve
      the system as far as security is concerned.  There is absolutely no protection at all.  If
      thatÆs what youÆre looking for in an operating system Windows is not the way to go. 
      Switch to Unix or something.  Basically thatÆs all you can do.  Microsoft continues to
      downplay the security concerns of Windows 98 as I write this.  I donÆt think anyoneÆs
      addressed all of these issues in one informative advisory before so I decided to.  I hope
      youÆve enjoyed this advisory!  Keep tabs on gH and me and KeyRoot.

      1 - Abstract
      
              Although there is client authentication and usually encryption
      between client and server, WLDoTrans.asp shows credit card information
      as clear text in hidden form fields.  This can be retrieved by anyone
      local to the machine by viewing the page's source.  If an attacker
      gets hold of the credit information they can buy things with your
      card.  I hope you like the advisory.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      2 - What is WLDoTrans.asp?
      
              WLDoTrans.asp is a secript used in a lot of online shopping.
      Basically it checks to see if the info a user enters in an ordering
      form is valid.  It allows a users to purchase something like a hat or
      a t-shirt or anything else in the online market.  When the user enters
      the information it gets encrypted before going to the server so that
      no one can intercept it and read it.  This is suppose to allow for
      secure online shopping.  However, as you will see, things aren't
      always secure as the little "you are in a secure area" boxes tell us.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      3 - Description
      
              Although ordering forms usually encrypt the information before
      sending it off to the server it's not secure.  Once the info reaches
      WLDoTrans.asp it gets decrypted in order to check and see if it's
      valid.  When WLDoTrans.asp loads and you view the source you can see
      in clear text the credit information you entered.  This includes the
      card type, the full credit card number, the expiration date, and the
      full name on the card.  The line with the credit card should look like
      
      &lt;INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="CARDNUM" VALUE="cardnumber">
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      4 - Impact
              Although the script is not accessible to anyone remotely, any
              time you step away from the
      computer there's nothing keeping someone from walking up to it and
      doing as they please.  Even after you log out of an online shopping
      area, an attacker can press the "back" buttonin your web browser until
      they reach WLDoTrans.asp.  All they have to do is view the source of
      the page and boom there it is.  With your credit card number, type,
      and full name they can order anything they want to anywhere.  It
      doesn't even have to be to them.  They could decide to put you in debt
      and buy a plane.  An attacker could easily run your credit card out
      and give you bad credit.  You probably wouldn't even notice anything
      until you receive a bill for $800,000 or until someone says "sorry,
      this card is no good".
      
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      5 - What to do about it
      
              The most obvious way to fix the problem is to encrypt the
      hidden form fields (HFFs) which contain the credit card information.
      This is very easy and affordable and allows WLDoTrans.asp to function
      normally.  Well encryption requires decryption on the server side and
      encryption on the web page side.  Basically this would allow you to
      encrypt the hidden values before they're submitted to WLDoTrans.asp.
      When WLDoTrans.asp loads it is imperative that it displays only the
      encrypted values or risk retrieval of the credit card information.

      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      1 - Abstract
      
              Many CGI scripts today accept hidden values that aren't correct.  When an attacker
      enters a value other than what is expected the script behaves weird and sometimes will allow the
      retrieval of passwords, credit card information, or system browsing.  Basically that's it.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      2 - Description
      
              More than half of all websites today are dependent on some sort of CGI script.  This
      could be to admin a system over the www, edit something, login, or make a payment.  Many of
      these scripts are written by an inexperienced programmer or one who is unconcerned about the
      security of the site.  Their reliance on faulty programs is a big security problem.  What happens
      most of the time is that a user inputs something to the script and the script doesn't check to see if
      the value is an acceptible value.  For example, here's a form from a system I was checking out a
      little while ago:
      
      &lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/faultyscript">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="member" TYPE=hidden VALUE="">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="membername" TYPE=hidden VALUE="myaccount">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="authentication" TYPE=hidden VALUE="abMBIV9v/bcdo">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="passwd" TYPE=hidden VALUE="">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="fulladdress" TYPE=hidden VALUE="http://www.server.com/blahblah">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="subdirectory" TYPE=hidden VALUE="">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="email" TYPE=hidden VALUE="">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="diskspace" TYPE=hidden VALUE="">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="extras" TYPE=hidden VALUE="">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="timestamp" TYPE=hidden VALUE="907100341">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="extlist" TYPE=hidden VALUE="">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="blah" TYPE=hidden VALUE="The name of the faulty script">
      &lt;INPUT NAME="filename" TYPE=hidden VALUE="index.html">
      
      ...
      
      &lt;INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="operation" VALUE="Save and Continue Editing">
      
      ...
      
              With this example, the form came with my account.  However, when I simply change the
      hidden form named "membername" from the value of my account name to the value of any other
      account name including the root and webmaster accounts.  When the page was loaded with the
      value "webmaster" replacing my account all I did was click save and a new page loaded with the
      webmaster account's password smack dab in the middle.  This kind of attack can work on any
      system running a CGI script.  All that has to happen is a kid willing to take two or three minutes
      out of his boring life and think.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      3 - Impact
      
              All this goes to show is that CGI scripts sometimes do weird things when they receive an
      input that they don't recognize.  This could mean retrieval of account passwords, credit card
      information, or browsing the system and opening files.  The impact of this problem is pretty deep. 
      If an attacker can get the webmaster's password they have total control over that site.  The
      attacker can open, alter, and delete files.  They can delete or add users, change the content of the
      main webpage, and basically do anything to the system.  If the attacker gets credit card
      information they can buy anything on someone else's credit card information and your system
      could be held responsible.  Also if the attacker can browse the system's files they can retrieve the
      passwd file or some other file that can lead to root access.  Basically it's not a good idea to have
      vulnerable CGI scripts at all.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      4 - What to do about it
      
              There only thing you can really do about this is to go back and look over the source to all
      of your CGI scripts and make sure there are checks in all of the right places.  There can't be any
      place where an attacker can enter false data and have the script accept it.  If you're at all worried
      that someone might try to exploit you then it's a good idea and it's easy.  Take a few minutes
      during lunch while you're drinking a Cherry Pepsi and eating a Philly Sub to make corrections. 
      Well that's it for this advisory.  I hope you've enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

42.0 Can my firewall protect me? by Mnemonic

      Can my firewall protect me? by Mnemonic
      7/7/99
      KeyRoot
      
              Everytime I look through a computer magazine or search the Internet, I see an advertisement
      for a firewall.  "Your solution to hackers" many of them boast.  By calling a product a firewall,
      vendors fool a lot of companies into buying something they don't know what it does, or something
      that won't help them at all.  A firewall is software that filters incoming and outgoing connections to
      a system.  It also monitors all server requests and the activity of the system's users on the Internet. 
      Although a company may feel safe running a firewall, they're still at a high risk of being attacked. 
      The firewall may very well protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and basic attempts at
      gaining root, or supervisor, access on the system, many firewalls actually increase the risk of attack
      rather than adding protection.  If a firewall is improperly setup, it may allow remote access to even
      the most stupid of hackers.  Additionally, the firewall may have its own problems without the help
      of an under-practiced administrator.
              It may contain a buffer overflow, for example, in the source code.  Or it may have some
      other problem which allows remote execution of files.  The problem is today's security standards
      are no higher than a sign that says "back off" on a fence post.  When a hacker knows that a system
      is running a firewall, they quickly check around to see what kind of firewall in order to exploit it. 
      He doesn't get worried and try the next system that looks vulnerable.  I know this from my own
      experience.
              A few days ago, I broke into a system, with permission of course, that boasted no kid could
      break into it.  It was running NT 4.0, IIS 4.0, Remote Access, some Cisco Router, and MIP 2.0. 
      The system was actually  vulnerable to several publicly-available exploits that led to admin-level
      access.  The firewall did nothing to prevent the attacks.
              If you would like to protect your system, the best way is to keep up on all of the latest
      attacks and how to protect yourself against each one individually.  This method is much more
      affective than buying something that could actually weaken your security instead of providing a
      shield.  If you'd like to get in touch with me I'm Mnemonic and I'm usually an op in #Legions on

              So you're sitting at your computer, drinking a Pepsi, reading your new magazine,
      whatever, and you decided to read this paper because it sounded cool.  Well.. it is.  No no, I
      mean it is but that's not the point.  There are so many companies out there that depend on the
      Internet to do business.  Whether their business is marketing, communication, or video games, the
      company's systems are in use by people who aren't always on-site.  Many times a programmer
      will be hired to create programs that are made to carry out purposes that are specific to the needs
      of the company.  This opens up a big security risk.  If the program is configured incorrectly, or
      used in a way other than it was designed for, the program could behave iradically and give the user
      supervisor access.  The purpose of this paper is to show how an attacker would exploit one of
      these programs, not how to eliminate the risk.  However, in knowing the means of penetration, you
      should be able to design programs that will adamantly protect against tcp/ip based intrusions. 
      Read over this paper carefully, and learn a thing or two.  If you have any suggestions or comments
      feel free to contact me.

      2)  Why it is a problem
      3)  How the programs are exploited
      4)  Why anyone would want to attack a company
      5)  Conclusion
      
      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
      
      1 - Who's at risk?
      
              There are a lot of companies out there and a lot of different work fields.  It's hard to
      narrow it down to only a handful that are at risk, because everyone is at risk.  Everyone that uses
      the Internet on a day-to-day basis that is.  Any company that does online banking or that deals
      with any type of exchange of information or requires off-site use of their systems is at risk.  For
      example, Booking Inc. might be set up in Saint Mary, Maryland and have an employee named
      Bob in Miami, Florida.  Suppose Bob needs to access Booking's server to update the information
      about an airline that was suppose to arrive in a few weeks.  Bob needs to replace it with
      information on another airline that will be arriving in its place, but he's nowhere near Booking Inc.'s
      location.  The solution is to provide Bob with an easy way to do his job from where he is:  the
      Internet.  Booking Inc. hires a programmer to write them a software suite that will allow Bob to
      connect to Booking's system and update certain things in a certain way.  This is the way most
      companies today think, but it's not a good way of thinking.
      
      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
      
      2 - Why it is a problem
      
              The problem with this solution is that someone not employed by the company can use the
      same means of access as Bob to access the company's database.  This isn't a good idea because
      from there, the attacker can flaunt around as if he were a part of your company.  He could make
      transactions in the company's name, change schedules, or any number of things that would cost the
      company anywhere from nothing to thousands of dollars.  No company can afford to leave their
      information that open.  Access to the database doesn't mean just looking around.  It means the
      ability to change things and go unnoticed.  Many times a user will alter something that may pass
      without question until that something is called on.  Then it really has an impact on the company. 
      Too many companies don't realize there is a problem until it is too late, so I'm telling you now.  If
      your company runs its own software there's a good chance that it is vulnerable to attack.
      
      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
      
      3 - How the programs are exploited
      
              Since each program is different, there are obviously more ways to exploit the programs
      than I can mention here.  Although, I will go over one of the most common methods of program
      exploitation.  It is called a buffer overflow.  A buffer is an area shared by software that can be
      called upon to recount things.  It temporarily saves necessary data.  This is where a program is
      designed to accept data, assign it a value, and store that value, that data, in a buffer.  A buffer can
      only hold a certain amount of data.  When a program receives an amount of data that is more than
      the buffer can handle, the program will not function properly.  This is called a buffer overflow.  The
      program will give the attacker privileges equivalent to that of its owner.  For example, the program
      may be "owned" by the supervisor.  That is, it can perform tasks with supervisor-equivalent
      privileges.  Let's suppose that the software Booking Inc. has given Bob is called Doober, and that
      the host side of Doober has these lines:
      
      char flightnm[168]
      printf("Change flight number to?\n", flightnm);
      strcpy(flightnm);
      
      The problem is that flightnm can only hold data up to 168 bytes and doesn't check to see if the
      input will fit in the buffer.  If Doober is owned by the supervisor, then an attacker could exploit
      Doober with a program that would input a string greater than 168 bytes.  This would easily give
      the attacker supervisor rights.  Here's another example:
      
      char buffer1[1024];
      char buffer2[1024]
      ...
      memset(buffer1, 1, sizeof(buffer1));
      memset(buffer2, 2, sizeof(buffer2));
      ...
      memcpy(buffer2, buffer1, sizeof(buffer2));
      
      If, however, you want to fix the problem, you can just add a line to make sure the input fits:
      
      ...
      memcpy(buffer2, buffer1, sizeof(buffer2));
      if ((buffer2 != 1024) && (buffer2 > 1024) && (buffer1 != 1024) && (buffer1 > 1024)) {
      printf("That was too big\n");
      exit(1);
      }
      
      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
      
      5 - Conclusion
      
              If your system is running company-specific software, I more than believe that you're
      vulnerable to attack.  I advise review the source code to all programs, and defining the type of
      access that the program has to the system.  Bob from Booking Inc. may need to update airline
      information, but not the method of payment the airline's customers are using.  So play it safe and all
      that jazz.  If you have any comments or suggestions or if shx.c for SunOS doesn't compile right
      (I've used shx.c for BSD don't e-mail me about that), I'm Mnemonic at xkyller@hotmail.com. 
      Peace out.

      Exploiting The NetWare Bindery

      Mnemonic and KeyRoot Information Security
      we'll get a webpage to go here
      xkyller@hotmail.com
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
              For those of you who follow my stuff in Keen Veracity, some of the material in this advisory
      is repeated material from previous releases.  This advisory should be accurate for versions of
      NetWare up to and including NetWare 3.x
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      1 - Abstract
      
              For a long time, NetWare has been doing very poorly in the security field.  Even with the
      many tools released by various people to bring to light NetWare's weaknesses, Novell
      continues to ignore the existance of its problems until the details of an attack have been released
      to the public.  As a wannabe admin and a repetitive Pepsi drinker, I think it is necessary for me
      to release my research on NetWare security.  The problem now is that the NetWare bindery is
      openly accessible to any NetWare user.  This means to my password, your password, and that
      idiot in the office next to you's password.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      2 - The NetWare Bindery
      
              NetWare's bindery is basically memory sectioned off for use of NetWare proccesses.  It's
      a database where NetWare keeps information about the network resources and users that
      many function groups use to store and retrieve information.  Each file server on a network
      system has its own bindery, and thus its own group of known objects.  The NetWare bindery
      can best be compared to the Force.  It binds the galaxy together.  Yeah..
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      3 - Description
      
              There are actually two things I want to discuss here.  The first is getting the password for
      someone else's account, and the other is getting the password for the account you're on.
      They're two seperate things.  Now check it out:
              NetWare represents each shared application, printer, or a logged-in user as an object in
      the bindery.  Each object has identifying characteristics, known as properties.  Properties are
      dependant on objects which have these attributes:
      
      OBJECT ID
      OBJECT NAME
      OBJECT TYPE
      OBJECT FLAG
      OBJECT SECURITY
      PROPERTIES FLAG
      
      These are the properties attributes:
      
      OBJECT ID
      PROPERTY NAME
      PROPERTY FLAGS
      PROPERTY SECURITY
      VALUES FLAG
      
      The property name is a character string of up to 16 characters, including the null terminator. 
      Propery names have the same restrictions on the use of characters as object names.
      
              The property flags are stored as a one-byte field.  They indicate whether the property is
      static or dynamic, and whether it is an item or a set.  Sets are lists of object IDs which are
      interpreted by NetWare.  Item properties are unformatted binary fields stored in 128-byte
      segments which are interpreted by applications or NetWare APIs.
              Any user can retrieve the 128-byte segment which represents an object's password, and
      then convert this binary string into clear text.  The user first calls GetObjectData() to get the
      name of the object.  This function uses ScanBinderyObject() to populate a structure of type
      OBJECT.  There are two ways of identifying objects.  You can use the OBJECT ID or the
      OBJECT NAME and OBJECT TYPE.  The last element is a dummy with all fields cleared to
      0.  Here the user calls GetUserAndApplicationData() to retrieve the password.  For example:
      
      ...
      
      GLOBAL int GetUserAndAppInfo(char *argv[], int nMaxArgs, OBJECT *pObject)
      {
      
        strcpy(aop->obj.szObjectName, argv[nMaxArgs - 2])'
        aop->obj.wObjectType = OT_APPLICATION;
        strcpy(aop->szPassword, argv[nMaxArgs - 1]);
        fread(&szPassword, sizeof(int), 1, inpf);
        printf("\nThe password for that account is ", szPassword, "\n");
      }
      
              The second thing I want to discuss is the retrieval of the password for the account that
      you're on.  To do this we use  functions in the Connection Services.  So we can call
      GetConnectionNumber() to get the number that the file server has assigned to this workstation's
      connection.  Then we call GetConnInfo() to get the name of the user among other information
      including the password.  Take a look:
      
      ...
      
      void GetMyAccountPassword(char *argv[], int nMaxArgs, OBJECT *pObject)
      {
        FS_CONNECTION_INFO *pFSConnInfo;
      
        pFSConnInfo = GetConnInfo(GetConnectionNumber());
      
        if (pFSConnInfo == NULL)
        return -1;
      
        /* this is where the user info is now */
      
        *pObject = pFSConnInfo->fsLoggedObject.obj;
        free9pFSConnInfo);
        strcpy(aop->obj.szObjectName, argv[nMaxArgs - 2]);
        aop->obj.wObjectType = OT_APPLICATION;
        strcpy(aop->szPassword, argv[nMaxArgs -1]);
        fread(&szPassword, sizeof(int), 1, inpf);
      
        printf("\nThe password for the account you're on is ", szPassword, "\n");
      
      }
      
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      4 - Impact
      
              Wow.  I shouldn't even have to go over this section.  If your network is running NetWare
      and you have private data of any sort on the network, your data is succeptible to the will of the
      attacker.  The severity of this attack is only as big as the system that is affected.  A hacker may
      decide to get the password to the supervisor account if the supervisor is logged in.  If that
      happens, the hacker will have complete control of every computer on the NetWare network. 
      The hacker may decide to change or delete your data, or nothing at all.
      
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      
      5 - What to do about it
      
              There is actually nothing that any of us can do about this right now.  We can't deny people
      access to the NetWare bindery or monitor their queries of it.  The best thing to do right now is
      to switch to something more secure until the problem is fixed in a later version of NetWare.  It
      would be wise to presume that it works on all versions of NetWare.

45.0 Tax Break for Key Escrow Crypto 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
     
     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Code Kid 
      H.R. 2617, a bill sponsored by Porter Goss (R-Florida),
      seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to
      allow a tax credit for development costs of encryption
      products with plain text capability without the user's
      knowledge. This will give companies a great monetary
      incentive to create weak crypto. (It will also allow
      people to find out what publicly traded companies took
      advantage of this tax break, so you will know which
      products to avoid.)

      A Tax Break for Snoopable Code
      by Declan McCullagh 

      3:00 a.m.  30.Jul.99.PDT
      WASHINGTON -- If anyone in Washington
      qualifies as an ardent foe of encryption,
      it's congressman Porter Goss (R-Florida). 

      Two years ago, the chairman of the
      House Intelligence committee tried to
      make it a crime to distribute
      privacy-protecting software, such as PGP
      or recent versions of Netscape Navigator
      and Internet Explorer. 

      The plan failed, but Goss didn't give up.
      On Wednesday, he and the panel's
      ranking Democrat introduced a bill to
      jump-start the US market for encryption
      products with backdoors that would
      support government surveillance. 

      The "Tax Relief for Responsible Encryption
      Act" gives companies a 15 percent tax
      break on the costs of developing
      government-snoopable encryption
      products. 

      Such products might support key
      recovery -- in which a copy of the secret
      key needed to unlock scrambled data is
      placed within reach of law enforcement
      -- or "other techniques." 

      "This legislation offers a way out of the
      stalemate between those who view
      commerce and national security as an
      'either-or' proposition," Goss said in a
      statement. 

      Goss and 22 other House members also
      sent a letter to President Clinton asking
      him to organize a "summit" of industry
      executives and government officials to
      extract an agreement on encryption
      regulation. 

      "It has become evident that your
      leadership on this issue is vital to resolve
      the equally legitimate interests of law
      enforcement, national security, privacy,
      and industry.... We believe that without
      your personal involvement on this issue
      now, our national security and public
      safety will suffer serious and needless
      consequences," the legislators said. 

      Law enforcement groups and their allies in
      the Clinton administration have long
      pressed for snoopable encryption
      products, complaining that a parade of
      undesirables -- such as pedophiles, drug
      smugglers, and money launderers -- might
      use crypto to communicate in secret. 

      But the idea of the government
      subsidizing potential privacy invasions
      doesn't appear to be wildly popular. 

      "I think the government's role is to
      protect the individual liberties of its
      citizens -- they should be giving
      companies incentives to strengthen
      encryption," said Jennifer DePalma, a
      graduate fellow at the Institute for
      Humane Studies at George Mason
      University in Arlington, Virginia. 

      "They should let the free market continue
      to put an emphasis on protecting people's
      privacy," she said. 

      For its part, the House Permanent Select
      Committee on Intelligence is insisting that
      it's pushing a voluntary approach. 

      The committee members have abandoned
      their hope for a ban on unapproved
      encryption software, a source said. The
      administration has pushed for a key
      recovery scheme, whereby law
      enforcement would gain access to
      "plaintext," or unencrypted, information. 

      But the market has rejected such
      options. 

      "Mandatory recoverability is a
      nonstarter," a committee staff member
      said. "Law enforcement doesn't need us
      to mandate access to plaintext
      domestically." 

      "The congressman does not want to
      mandate recovery of encryption
      products. He wants to encourage
      products that have societal benefits," a
      spokesman for Goss said. 

      The committee last week said in a report
      that a bill to roll back some export
      restrictions on encryption products would
      harm children while protecting "criminals
      and international thugs." 

      "Child pornographers could distribute their

           White House spokesman David Leavy on Thursday
           adamantly denied a new International Public Information
           (IPI) system would be directed at American audiences.
          IPI is a secret Clinton administration program to control
     public information disseminated by the departments of State and
     Defense and intelligence agencies.
          It is meant to "influence foreign audiences in a way favorable
     to the achievement of U.S. foreign-policy objectives," according
     to a draft IPI charter obtained by The Washington Times.
          But critics claim that IPI will be used for domestic
     propaganda. 
                 -- Continued from Front Page -- 

          "That is totally inaccurate," Mr. Leavy said. "The IPI
     initiative is designed to better organize the government and the
     instruments we have to support our public diplomacy, military
     activities and economic engagement overseas. There is no
     impact on the domestic press."
          Mr. Leavy said that U.S. information officials at home and
     abroad serve different functions.
          "There are officers who work with the media in the United
     States and officers who support the U.S. policy overseas. They
     are totally separate. They are totally different functions," Mr.
     Leavy said.
          But a former deputy chief of the U.S. Information Agency
     (USIA) under three presidents said he fears the IPI plan would
     mean U.S. propaganda aimed at foreigners would be used to
     influence American elections.
          Gene Kopp, who served under Presidents Nixon, Ford and
     Bush, said the elections of President Kennedy and President
     Carter were directly influenced by leaks of USIA foreign
     public-opinion polls showing a decline in U.S. prestige abroad.
          "I am concerned this could happen again under the IPI plan,"
     said Mr. Kopp, currently a Washington lawyer. "The
     administration is transferring all assets, except broadcasting, to
     State, where they will not be separated in any way. It will be
     very difficult to separate what is disseminated in the United
     States and overseas."
          He said that the opportunity for abusing the system will be
     great.
          "The temptation to spin this stuff in a partisan way will be
     very strong -- probably irresistible," he said. "The other ominous
     feature is that this includes the intelligence agencies. They are in
     the business of misinformation. God only knows where that
     goes."
          New allegations emerged Thursday that the Clinton
     administration has been trying to control how American news
     organizations cover foreign affairs, at least since the Bosnia
     peacekeeping mission in 1996.
          According to a former government official, who insisted on
     anonymity, the White House created a Strategic Planning
     Directorate, which used the State Department and USIA to
     pressure American reporters into favorable coverage of the U.S.
     troop deployment in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
          It came into being just prior to the 1996 presidential election.
          "I heard them talk about it in conference telephone calls
     --how they had to control the media out there, the bureau chiefs,
     because if the Republicans picked this up [the Clinton
     administration] would be exposed as having no foreign policy,"
     said the former government official.
          Shortly after President Clinton won re-election in 1996, the
     administration announced that U.S. troops would not be home by
     Christmas, as promised. Today, nearly three years later, some
     7,000 U.S. troops remain in Bosnia.
          "The U.S. public wanted to know how long American troops
     had to be there," said the ex-official. "The Clinton people said
     'only one year,' and [that] they would be home in December,
     after the election. But everyone knew the only way to keep the
     warring sides apart was robust international and American
     presence."
          This former official said this was widely discussed.
          "In the conference calls, they openly discussed how they had
     to prevent American journalists from discussing this," he said.
          The source said that USIA officials and National Security
     Adviser Samuel R. Berger tried to convince American editors
     not to publish accounts by their reporters who wrote that Bosnia
     was unsafe for Americans, that Muslim extremists were a
     threat, and that the warring sides would never be pacified.
          Ivo Daalder, who was a staffer on the National Security
     Council at the time, said discussions had no ulterior motives.
          Mr. Daalder, who is now at the Brookings Institution, said the
     talks among the USIA, National Security Council and other
     agencies "had the sole purpose of making sure they share
     information among them, and when the U.S. government speaks
     to the outside world, it does so in a coordinated manner."
          Mr. Daalder said "there was no deliberate campaign
     designed to put out false information prior to the 1996
     presidential election."
          He said that USIA did increase staffing and efforts to
     convince American reporters in Bosnia of the administration's
     perspective in September, prior to the Bosnian elections.

47.0 Jail Time for Users of Crypto 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
     
      contributed by Code Kid 
      The Electronic Communications Bill, proposed in Britain,
      could send users of encryption products to jail for up to
      two years. Basically if you send encrypted mail to
      someone who is being investigated by the police the
      police can ask you for your keys. If you refuse you
      could get up to two years in jail. Tip off the person who
      received the encrypted message and get five years.

      Use encryption, go to jail? 

      July 29, 1999
      Web posted at: 11:11 a.m. EDT (1511 GMT)
 
      by Douglas F. Gray 
 
      LONDON (IDG) -- Encryption users
      could face up to two years in prison
      for refusing to hand over the keys to
      their code, according to Britain's
      proposed Electronic Communications
      Bill. 
 
      The bill is causing concern among
      privacy advocates and opposition
      parties, who say the bill gives law
      enforcement wide-reaching power
      over private Internet communications.
 
      Most aggravating, the bill calls for a
      possible two years in prison for
      anyone refusing to turn over the
      encryption key or the message in
      plain text to law-enforcement
      officials. It also calls for a five-year
      prison term for tipping off senders
      that they are being investigated,
      according to Caspar Bowden,
      director of the London-based
      Foundation for Information Policy
      Research. 
 
      Even discussing an investigation in public, such as complaining about alleged
      abuses of law enforcement to the media, may also be punishable by
      imprisonment, said Bowden. "Let's say that someone under investigation sends
      me a message with encryption that can only be decrypted by the receiver. The
      authorities come to me and tell me that they are investigating someone, but
      won't tell me who, so they ask for all my private keys," Bowden said. Refusing
      this request from the authorities could get him two years in prison, said
      Bowden. 
 
      In such a case, the authorities would have all of Bowden's private keys,
      enabling law enforcement to read all encrypted correspondence that was sent
      to him. Bowden would then have no choice, he said, because by informing
      anyone of this, and asking them to change their key, he would break the
      "tipping off" clause of the bill and in turn and face five years imprisonment. 
 
      "I can't complain to the newspaper, otherwise
      it's five years in jail. All I can do is go to a
      secret tribunal," Bowden said. He's not joking:
      The tribunal is five judges, only two have to
      participate, and only one has to lay the
      groundwork, he added. 
 
      Bowden feels that the entire bill needs to be
      re-examined by the U.K.'s Department of
      Trade and Industry. "We would like to see the
      Electronic Communication Bill be about
      e-commerce, which is what they said; the
      law-enforcement section doesn't even belong
      in it," he added. 
 
      There is also another method of hiding
      messages, called steganography. It's not really
      clear to commentators such as Bowden
      whether or not steganography is covered by
      the bill. With steganography, users can
      "sprinkle an encrypted message" into a
      photographic format, such as JPEG, or a
      music format such as MP3, both of which are very popular online. In actuality,
      the message does not necessarily need to be encrypted, just concealed within
      the file, according to Bowden. 
 
      Although the bill does not mention technologies such as steganography,
      Bowden speculated that the authorities could enforce regulations in those
      cases by proving that there was a reason to search, such as the existence of a
      steganography program on the suspect's computer.

      Thursday evening

     THE VULNERABILITY IS CONTAINED in the Jet
     3.51 driver (ODBCJT32.DLL) that was shipped with the

            Juan Carlos G. Cuartango, a Spanish Web developer
     who has discovered other important security holes, reported
     the problem to the NTBugTraq mailing list Thursday
     afternoon. Later Thursday, the Microsoft Security Team
     confirmed the bug in a posting to the same list.
            ôIf you open a malicious Excel worksheet implementing
     this vulnerability it will send shell commands to your operating
     system (Windows NT, 95 and 98 are all affected) that can:
     (infect) you (with) a virus, delete your disks, read your files,ö
     Cuartango said in his posting to the list. ôà(T)he worksheet
     will get full control over your machine.ö
            The Microsoft posting said the company is preparing to
     release a security bulletin dealing with the vulnerability.
     Shortly before 5 a.m. ET Friday, the bulletin had not
     appeared on the Microsoft Office Update site or the
     Microsoft security site.

     exist, and urge all customers who are using Jet 3.51 to
     upgrade to Jet 4.0,ö the Microsoft mail to NtBugTraq said.
     ôThis vulnerability should be taken seriously. Office 97 users
     in particular should consider immediately upgrading their
     database driver to Jet 4.0, as Jet 3.51 is installed by default in
     Office 97. Office 2000 users do not need to upgrade, as
     Office 2000 installs Jet 4.0 by default.ö 

            An Excel worksheet that contains code to take
     advantage of the vulnerability could be hidden in a frame on a
     Web page or sent in an e-mail. As long as the worksheet
     contained no macros, there would be no indication to the user
     who visited the Web page or opened the e-mail that any code
     had been executed, Cuartango reported. If the file is sent in
     e-mail, the recipient must be on-line to be affected,
     Cuartango said. He recommended not opening documents
     you are not expecting to receive and going off-line before
     opening e-mail.
            If the worksheet were instead sent as an attachment to
     e-mail, the recipient could avoid ill effects by not opening the
     attachment.

     four years in jail in what is believed to be
     the country's first criminal case involving
     software piracy, state media reported

50.0 MITNICK: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MANIPULATED THE FACTS

     Did the US government manipulate the facts on the subject of Kevin Mitnick? He and

     claim proves this. Full story below.

      Mitnick: 'I was never a malicious person'
      By Kevin Poulsen, ZDNN
      July 30, 1999 4:36 PM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2306704,00.html?chkpt=zdnnstop
      
      Kevin Mitnick and his attorneys are asking a federal judge to unseal a court filing that they claim
      proves the government was guilty of misconduct while building its case against the hacker. The
      goal, says Mitnick in a rare interview, is to clear his name. 
      
      "At the beginning of this case the federal government manipulated the facts to allege losses that
      were grossly inflated," Mitnick said in a telephone interview Thursday night from the Los Angeles
      Metropolitan Detention Center. "Hopefully, if the court considers this motion and rules upon its
      merits, it will clear me publicly of the allegations that I caused these significant losses." 
      
      The motion, filed by defense attorney Don Randolph on July 22, is the latest conflict in a case
      that's remained unusually acrimonious, considering that both sides reached a plea settlement in
      March. Under the terms of the agreement, Mitnick pleaded guilty to seven felonies and admitted
      to penetrating computers at such companies as Motorola (NYSE:MOT), Fujitsu and Sun
      Microsystems, (Nasdaq:SUNW) and downloading proprietary source code. On Aug. 9, he's
      expected to be sentenced to 46 months in prison, on top of the 22 months he received for cell
      phone cloning and an earlier supervised release violation. 
      
      Mitnick vexed by 'snowball effect'
      The only sentencing issue left unresolved is the amount of money Mitnick will owe his victims. 
      
      Prosecutors are seeking $1.5 million in restitution -- a modest figure compared to the more than
      $80 million the government quoted to an appeals court last year, when it successfully fought to
      hold the hacker without bail. That figure, though no longer promulgated by
      prosecutors, vexes Mitnick, who sees a "snowball effect" of bad press that
      began with a 1994 front-page article in the New York Times. 
      
      "Because of this assault that was made upon me by John Markoff of the New
      York Times, then the federal government grossly exaggerating the losses in
      the case and the damages I caused, I have a desire to clear my name,"
      Mitnick said. "The truth of the matter is that I was never a malicious person. I
      admit I was mischievous, but not malicious in any sense." 
      
      Markoff reported on Mitnick for the New York Times, and went on to
      co-author Tsutomu Shimomura's book, "Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture
      of America's Most Wanted Computer Outlaw -- By The Man Who Did It,"
      slated as an upcoming movie from Miramax. Markoff's portrayal of Mitnick,
      and the profit it ultimately earned him, has been the subject of some criticism from Mitnick's
      supporters, and raised eyebrows with a handful of journalists. 
      
      Markoff's most enduring Mitnick anecdote is the story that the hacker cracked NORAD in the
      early 1980s, a claim that was recycled as recently as last May by another New York Times
      reporter. "I never even attempted to access their computer, let alone break into it," Mitnick said.
      "Nor did I do a host of allegations that he says I'm guilty of." 
      
      For his part, Markoff says of the NORAD story: "I had a source who was a friend of Kevin's who
      told me that. I was not the first person to report it, nor the only person to report it." 
      
      Government collusion?
      The July 22 motion filed by Mitnick's attorney accuses the government of coaching victim
      companies on how to artificially inflate their losses. The filing is based on documents Randolph
      subpoenaed from Sun, which show that shortly after Mitnick's February 1995 arrest, the FBI
      specifically instructed Sun to calculate its losses as "the value of the source code" Mitnick
      downloaded, and to keep the figure "realistic." 
      
      Following the FBI's advice, Sun estimated $80 million in losses based on the amount they paid to
      license the Unix operating system. Six other companies responded, using software development
      costs as the primary calculus of loss. The total bill came to $299,927,389.61, significantly more
      than the $1.5 million the government says Mitnick inflicted in repair and monitoring costs, and theft
      of services and the $5 million to $10 million both sides stipulated to for purposes of sentencing. 
      
      "At the beginning of this litigation, the government misrepresented to the federal judiciary, the
      public and the media the losses that occurred in my case," Mitnick said. 
      
      To Randolph, it all smacks of collusion. "What comes out from the e-mails that we have, is that the
      so-called loss figures solicited by the government were research and development costs at best,
      fantasy at worst," he said. "I would classify it as government manipulation of the evidence." 
      
      However, prosecutor David Schindler dismissed Randolph's claims as "silly and preposterous." 
      
      "What would be inappropriate is to tell them what dollar amount to arrive at. In terms of the
      methodology, in terms of what is to be included in loss amounts, that direction is something we
      often provide because we're aware of what components are allowable under law, and which
      components are not," he said. 
      
      Schindler said development costs are a valid indicator of victim loss, but acknowledges that
      putting a dollar figure on software can be difficult. 
      
      Mitnick claims cover-up
      Mitnick and his attorney both say there's more to the story, but they can't talk about it. At
      Mitnick's last court appearance on July 12, the judge granted a government request that any filings
      relating to victim loss be sealed from the public. 
      
      "As much as the government would like to, you can't take the recipe for ice and file it under seal
      and have it become confidential," said Mitnick, who, along with his attorney, is challenging the
      confidentiality of the loss information, and asking for the motion to be unsealed. 
      
      Mitnick claims he smells a cover-up. "The government should not be permitted to bury the truth of
      the case from the public and the media by seeking and obtaining a protective order to essentially
      force me to enter a code of silence," he said. 
      
      "Our only concern, as it has been from day one, is the protection of the victims of Mitnick's
      crimes," prosecutor Schindler said. "Why Mitnick and his lawyers want to continue to harass,
      embarrass and abuse them remains a mystery to us, but it's something that we will continue to
      oppose vigorously." 
      
      Although the software costs are no longer being used against his client, Randolph claimed that by
      "manipulating the loss figures," the government raises the issue of whether even the more modest
      $1.5 million calculation is accurate. In the sealed motion, he's seeking an evidentiary hearing to
      explore the matter, and asking that Mitnick be released on a signature bond pending that hearing. 
      
      And if Mitnick winds up owing money anyway? "We're asking for sanctions that the government
      pay the restitution," Mitnick said, "and that the judge recommend that I be immediately designated
      to a halfway house for the government's misconduct in this case." 
      
      Excerpt of the Sun documents are available on the Free Kevin Web site, maintained by members
      of a tireless grass-roots movement that's protested the hacker's imprisonment for years. "I'd like to
      sincerely thank all my friends and supporters for all the support they've given me over this long
      period of time," Mitnick said. "I'd like to thank them from my heart."

51.0 ISPS ACCUSE CHINA OF INFOWAR

     Two Canadian ISPs claim they've traced DoS attacks on their network back to
     Chinese government offices in Beijing and now accuse "Chinese government crackers
     with a political agenda" as Wired puts it. The attacks are thought to be motivated
     because of the ISPs hosting sites of the, last week in China outlawed, Falun Gong
     religious group. Full story below.

     ISPs Accuse China of Infowar
     by Oscar S. Cisneros 
     
     12:00 p.m.  30.Jul.99.PDT
     Two Canadian ISPs said Friday that their networks were attacked this week by Chinese government crackers with a political agenda. 
     
     "The hack attempts I could trace [originated with] Chinese government offices in Beijing," said Eric Weigel, director of Bestnet Internet, a Hamilton,
     Ontario-based ISP. 
     
     Weigel said he suspected that the "denial of service" attack, which ended at 4 a.m. EST Friday, was motivated by his organization's hosting a Web
     site for a religious group outlawed in China. 
     
     "I know the Chinese government doesn't like the Falundafa Gong religion. They've arrested some people, but I don't know if anybody's been shot." 
     
     The Chinese government last week banned the "wheel of law," or Falun Gong, sect, stating that the group corrupted people's minds, disrupted
     social order, and sabotaged stability. The nation's state-run television network launched a negative media blitz against Falun Gong. 
     
     The group, which claims more than 2 million members, advocates meditation and exercise. In April, in a protest at Beijing's Zhongnanhai leadership
     compound, more than 10,000 Falun Gong members demanded protection for their religion. The government responded by destroying more than a
     million of the sect's books, tapes, and CDs. 
     
     If Weigel's hunch is correct, that fury has now extended into the world of the Internet. 
     
     "The Chinese government didn't even phone me up and say, 'Please remove this site,'" Weigel said. "That's pretty rude." 
     
     Weigel said he traced the hack attacks back to the Beijing Application Institute for Information Technology and the Information Center of Xin An
     Beijing. 
     
     The attackers used two common techniques to take on Bestnet and Nebula Internet Services, a smaller ISP in the nearby town of Burlington: They
     attempted to penetrate the ISPs' systems and also to flood their servers with incomplete requests for data -- a technique that overwhelms a Web
     server such that it is unable to serve up a Web site (in this case, Falun Gong's). 
     
     Neither effort was successful at Bestnet, Weigel said. But the denial of service attack did thwart Nebula Internet Services, which hosted Falun
     Gong's site until last week. 
     
     "They didn't have enough bandwidth to handle them, plus they're using a Windows machine," said Weigel. "I couldn't even copy the site using FTP
     -- they had to physically bring the files on a hard drive." 
     
     Nebula's owner, Greg Alexander, said that the attacks started a month ago and coincided with media reports of a government crackdown on the
     sect. 
     
     "The Chinese government has called the Falun Gong an enemy of the state and so we assumed that it's the Chinese government," he said. "They
     actually swamped our lines for two days -- we were maxed right out." 
     
     Alexander also said a US Department of Transportation official contacted him to ask about an attack on a server at the Federal Aviation
     Administration. The unnamed official told him that the "probe" of the FAA's server originated from one of Nebula's machines. Alexander added that
     the specific IP address was at the time assigned to Falun Gong. 
     
     "We didn't have control of our own IP address," he said. 
     
     The Department of Transportation could not be reached for comment late Friday afternoon. Alexander speculated that if someone made the attack
     look as if it originated from Falun Gong's IP address, they did so to make "the US government think that these people are bad people."

      Former hacker and FBI informant Justin Petersen is back in the news -- claiming that he is leaving
      behind a life of cybercrime to join the cyberporn business. 
      
      CNN and Time is promoting an "exclusive interview" with Petersen, who gained notoriety for
      informing on hackers Kevin Mitnick and Kevin Poulsen, and was recently released from prison
      after spending time in custody for parole violations. 
      
      According to a CNN press release, Petersen talks at length about his life as a "high-tech thief" and
      Internet pioneer, saying he was "trolling around on the information superhighway when it was just a
      dirt road." Petersen has multiple convictions for computer crimes, including an attempted
      electronic bank heist. 
      
      But Petersen tells CNN he now plans to begin a new life online, free of crime, with an adult Web
      site. The interview airs on CNN Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m. ET and 10 p.m. PT.

     Fact: PCs come with dangerous security holes. One of the major problems still is the
     scripting ability of machines, the ability to run applets and all of this in combination
     with the Web represent some serious security and privacy issues of which the
     regulare home user is not always aware of. And it doesn't stop there. This article
     discusses this with some examples and quotes from major manufacturers. Read it
     below.

     Ghosts in the Machine
     by Chris Oakes 
     
     3:00 a.m.  30.Jul.99.PDT
     When Richard Smith bought a new Compaq Presario last Friday, he suspected there might be a few holes in the security of the computer's Internet
     software. 
     
     Sure enough. Within ten minutes of booting up the PC, Smith had flushed out the software equivalent of an assassin for hire. 
     
     "I think this is one of the worst problems I've ever seen," said Smith, who has made a side-career during the last year of sniffing out major software
     holes. 
     
          
     Compaq had granted its Internet software potent capabilities. A clever Web page or email message could put out an electronic hit on an unwitting
     Presario owner using a software demon that comes in the guise of an applet. 
     
     The applet, called "SpawnApp," was installed by Compaq on its Presario line of PCs as part of its customer service applications. 
     
     While Compaq intended to streamline customer support over the Net using handy Web tools -- Internet Explorer 4 and Java applications -- the
     company unwittingly put its customers at risk. 
     
     "All you need is a little bit of JavaScript to misuse the control. They've left it wide open, so you can run anything. You can give a delete command
     that deletes everything in the [Windows] My Documents directory." 
     
     "Anybody can use it because [Compaq's] told the world it's a safe thing." 
     
     SpawnApp is a bridge, launching any DOS or Windows application. With simple coding, a rogue programmer could access the Java applet from the
     Net to launch any application on the computer. Programmers could use the applet to mess up some data -- perhaps nab some files and email
     messages, or change the PC's security settings for further breaches. 
     
     The problem is apparently the tip of an iceberg that may plague more PCs than even manufacturers know. These ghosts in the software machine
     only get noticed when people like Smith do some digging. Companies often don't respond in force to alarms until the media spreads the word. 
     
     Smith said he wasn't the first to arrive on the scene of the dangerous applet. Another programmer, Frank Farance, originally discovered the applet
     in November 1998, and yet the problem remained. 
     
     Smith turned up a similar vulnerability on Hewlett-Packard's Pavilion line of PCs only a week earlier. HP moved quickly and provided a fix; Compaq is
     considering doing the same. 
     
     With or without fixes, Smith sees the trend as a dangerous one. 
     
     "If you take HP and Compaq together, they're in the top three or four manufacturers in the United States. They've both been shipping machines for
     a year which have pretty big openings ... So you've got some pretty big players messing up here." 
     
     Compaq "signed" its applet, which is a standard security function meant to indicate the program's tasks were designed by the company and
     therefore safe to execute. But because further steps weren't taken, anyone could misuse the potentially dangerous set of functions, Smith said. 
     Compaq confirmed that under some scenarios, the user may not see any warning if their browser or email program were to encounter malicious code
     that invokes the applet. 
     
     "Compaq is looking at the possibility of updating [the system software] so that something like this could not occur," said Jim Ganthier, director of
     engineering for Presarios. 
     
     He called the actual exploitation of the security hole highly unlikely, however. 
     
     Smith said a simple solution to the problem is to delete the .REG (registry) file that makes Compaq a trusted publisher. That file can be found by the
     name CERTREG.REG, he said. 
     
     Smith contends the security hole is the latest -- and most serious -- in a growing legacy of dangerous knotholes in standard-issue PC software. 
     
     Other holes have largely centered on potential access to personal data, such as Microsoft's extraction of hardware-tracking ID numbers during the
     Windows registration process. 
     
     Smith and others have also turned up a myriad JavaScript and ActiveX vulnerabilities that can crack a PC's file directories by way of Netscape
     Navigator or Internet Explorer. 
     
     Smith considers the latest example severe because of the ability to launch any application on the PC -- without the user ever noticing. 
     
     So with all these dangers -- caught only when a programmer like Smith pays close attention -- what are the prospects for security in a networked,
     e-commerce age? 
     
     The current chain of events -- discovery, disclosure, and company reaction -- is the best, according to free marketeer Justin Matlick, author of
     Governing Internet Privacy: A Free Market Primer. 
     
     "The best solution is going to let privacy-conscious consumers and organizations ferret these problems out and force the companies or industries to
     respond," Matlick said. "I think that the free market is much more responsive to these concerns than regulation could ever hope to be." 
     
     If that means consumers can expect only a certain level of security on the computers they buy, so be it. 
     
     "It's more important to me to use the product than it is to protect my privacy -- up to a certain level," Matlick said. 
     Brooke Partridge, electronic support programs manager for Hewlett-Packard, agrees. 
     
     "We're not going to sell a lot of computers if people are worried about whether or not our systems allow access to their information. Really there is
     an inherent economic incentive." 
     
     Trust the market to find and fix holes in time? Nay, industry regulation is the only fix, if you ask electronic privacy advocate Jason Catlett. 
     
     "That's completely wrong. There are far too few people paying attention to this to bring even a hundredth of the incidents to the attention of the
     media -- or even the companies themselves." 
     
     The public has a right to a baseline standard of behavior that's determined by the best principles, Catlett argues. 
     
     "All that's needed is a simple private right of action for individuals." For example, a PC customer should have the right to go after a company for
     US$500 if his data is exposed by negligence, he said. 
     
     "That simple economic incentive would make a lot of companies clean up their act. That's exactly one of the risks that they should have as a
     routine part of their engineering." 
     
     Nancy Wong of the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office said information technology moves too fast for regulations. 
     
     "There are so many different ways of opening up systems and inserting vulnerabilities unknowingly that it's very difficult to say that government
     regulation is going to be able to address that. 
     
     "One of the reasons why I believe it's [a reactive situation] right now is because people really aren't thinking about security on an ongoing basis, or
     making systems secure at the same time they install systems." 
     Meanwhile, Peter Neumann, a scientist with SRI International and a consultant to the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection,
     said Smith's findings are not news -- and only a fraction of the story. 
     
     "Computer security is an oxymoron -- it doesn't exist. It's a joke. There's no way of fixing it short of producing new operating systems." 
     
     Neumann predicts that e-commerce will fall on its face when massive dollar transactions begin to depend on the security of today's inadequate
     networked PCs. For true network security, airtight components like encryption must be built into any Internet computer, Neumann said. 
     
     "When millions or trillions of dollars [are] going down the tube, people will start paying attention." 
     
     But according to Compaq's Ganthier, all this worrying is overblown. Vulnerabilities are one thing; actual exploitation is another. 
     
     "There's a whole bunch of if-then-else statements in there. To me it's like the Intel processor's serial numbers -- nobody's actually been able to
     demonstrate [an exploit]." 
     
     Software sleuth Smith said Ganthier's argument is true enough, but only for the time being. 
     
     "I've been looking at virus stuff for a while, but it's only been since the beginning of 1999 that virus writers have been exploiting email. Yet the
     capabilities have been there for three or four years." 
     
     Everyday sabotage exploits may be just down the road in a cyber-crime future. 
     
     "We just can't say," Smith said. "But we just need to close them up. There are a lot of vulnerabilities out there -- we just can't say which one is
     the one that will be used."

54.0 DATABASE PROTECTIONS OK-D

     A bill which is supposed to give providers of database information a weapon against
     electronic pirates and hackers got approved by a House panel yesterday. The bill
     gives the FTC the authority to prevent people from obtaining and distributing
     databases without permission and gives disseminators of real-time stock market
     information the right to sue hackers and pirates for that same offense. Full story below.

     Commerce subcommittee OKs database protections 
     By Bloomberg News
     Special to CNET News.com
     July 29, 1999, 3:15 p.m. PT 

     WASHINGTON--A House panel approved a bipartisan bill to give providers of database information such as mortgage
     rates or stock quotes a weapon against electronic pirates and hackers.

     The measure, passed on voice vote by the Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protections Subcommittee, gives the
     Federal Trade Commission authority to prevent people from obtaining and distributing databases without permission. 

     A section of the bill, approved last week by the same committee, gives stock exchanges and other disseminators of real-time
     stock market information the right to sue hackers and pirates.

     "This bill would, for the first time ever, create a federal stop sign to database privacy," said Rep. Tom Bliley (R-Virginia), who
     sponsored the bill. "But just as important, the bill will continue to protect consumers' access to information."

     A coalition of database owners, including financial data compilers, Internet companies, universities, and libraries, has lobbied in
     favor of the Bliley bill. Bloomberg, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has testified in favor of the bill.

     "[The bill] represents another arrow...you can seek if your information has been illegally pirated," said Skip Lockwood, coordinator
     of the Digital Futures Coalition, a lobbying firm that represents the shared interests of the educational and research communities
     and the computer industry.

     Support for an alternative bill
     The New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Realtors, and other owners of large databases have championed
     another bill with broader information protections.

     That bill, sponsored by Rep. Howard Coble (R-North Carolina), has passed the full Judiciary Committee and is awaiting
     consideration by the full House. The Coble bill affords a wider range of legal protection to database compilers than the Bliley bill,
     said Edward Miller, policy analyst for the National Association of Realtors.

     Coble's bill allows database creators to go after pirates through the courts, while the Bliley bill puts the FTC in charge of policing
     piracy on most databases. The FTC bureaucracy could bog down attempts by real estate agencies to go after hackers who steal
     their listings, Miller said.

     In addition, the Bliley bill's definition of "database" could allow pirates to take substantial portions of information with no
     consequences, he said.

     "To us, [the Bliley Bill] looks like they have provided a textbook on how to pirate data and do it legally," Miller said. "It's just the
     wrong approach."

     Internet companies such as Yahoo and Lycos and financial data companies such as Bloomberg oppose Coble's bill because they
     say it gives too much protection to companies that compile information, such as the NYSE. They also think it will concentrate
     ownership of facts in the hands of a few, Lockwood said.

     "With Coble's bill, there's nothing through the Internet pipelines. There's nothing to pass around," Lockwood said. "You are going
     to allow a few large owners of mass amounts of information to lock out everybody else."

     Digital signatures
     The telecommunications subcommittee also unanimously approved legislation today to give electronic signatures the same legal
     validity as those penned in ink. The bill would allow e-commerce and trades to take place online without requiring handwritten
     signatures for documentation.

     The electronic signatures bill doesn't set a standard for what types of technology would be acceptable as "signatures." While
     electronic pens, fingerprint scanners, and iris scanners are all currently available, legislators said they didn't want to stifle the
     technology by setting a standard before the electronic signatures industry had fully developed.

     Last week, the subcommittee added an amendment to the electronic signatures bill allowing the Securities and Exchange
     Commission to still require some records filed with the agency to be signed by hand.

     If the Commerce Committee approves the subcommittee's two bills, they will be submitted to the full House.

     An adult Web site is, due to a malconfiguration, spitting out the names, addresses,
     emails and credit card numbers of nearly 1000 of its members to anyone with a Web
     browser. This story also once again proves some people's unwillingness to put some
     effort in security, "I had informed them about this security issue ... but for some
     reason they needed to have ... [the site set up that way]." Story below.

      Italian Smut Site Left Unzipped
      by James Glave 
      
      2:45 p.m.  29.Jul.99.PDT
      An adult Web site run by the man who launched the career of Italian porn queen Cicciolina is showing more than just cheek. 
      
      It's also revealing the names, addresses, emails, and credit card numbers of nearly 1,000 of its members. 
      
      The site, Diva Futura, is configured in such a manner that several databases containing confidential user information can be easily accessed by
      anyone with a Web browser. 
      
      Diva Futura is owned by Italian porn king Riccardo Schicci, who last November was jailed in Italy on charges of running a prostitution racket. He is
      widely credited as the man who brought the porn movie industry to Italy. 
      
      "As soon as I figured out that was [Schicci's] site, I smelled something bad and figured out that I wanted to get away," said a former Diva Futura
      member, now a student of European Studies at a Washington DC university. 
      
      "I was so stupid and I was right," said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I did this thing two years ago when this kind of stuff was
      starting, and now I don't leave my credit card in any adult sites." 
      
      Schicci was released from prison soon after he was incarcerated. Efforts to reach Diva Futura's current site administrators were unsuccessful and
      the page remained vulnerable as of Friday morning. 
      
      Until recently, Web Creations, a New Jersey Web development firm, hosted the site. 
      
      But the man listed as the site administrator in the Internet Network Information Center database said that the site's current owner had not paid the
      firm's past-due bill. Anil Gurnani said that the site's owners have moved the operation elsewhere. 
      
      Gurnani told Wired News in an email, "This site is maintained by the client." 
      
      He said that the site's technicians knew of the security issue and insisted on leaving the site configured that way. "I had informed them about this
      security issue ... but for some reason they needed to have ... [the site set up that way]." 
      
      "This utter and complete lack of respect for private financial data is beyond reprehensible," said the Australian Web site developer who discovered
      the problem. "It is wildly reckless, and I find it inexcusable," he said in an email directed to the site's administrators. 
      
      Responding to an email query, one member of the site said that e-commerce is still not widespread in Italy. The member, who lives in Pavia, Italy,
      said in broken English that he hoped the site would be fixed soon, but took the whole matter in stride. 
      
      "What can I say?" he wrote. "Me and my friends a night still surfing on the Net, and we seek that URL ... you know who the Italians are ... geek ...
      really attracted about sex and so on, so I put my [card] number [on] the Net." 
      
      An examination of the site's data reveals that between December 1997 and June 1998, the site handled approximately US$22,000 worth of
      membership transactions. 
      
      As a member of the European Union, Italy is a signatory to the Data Protection Directive, a series of rules that protect the personal data of
      European consumers. 
      
      Article 17 of the directive compels companies to secure the personal data of their customers, though specific enforcement measures are left to the
      discretion of each member nation. 
      
      Diva Futura hosts images from Italian adult magazines Diva Futura, Bamby, Fans Club, and Le Aventure di Eva Henger. It also features streaming
      video, chat, and many images of Ilona Staller, more commonly known as Cicciolina. 
      
      Agence France Presse last fall reported that in 1989 Riccardo Schicci spent time in prison for shooting a hard-core porno film on a public beach. 
      
      Editor's Note: This story has been corrected. The original article incorrectly stated that Riccardo Schicci was once married to Cicciolina. Wired
      News regrets the error.

     Gov. Gray Davis yesterday signed a bill into a California law which allows contracts
     with electronic signatures to count as legal documents. The new law applies to firms
     doing business in California and their customers in all 50 states, according to a
     statement released by one of the bill's sponsors ETrade Group Inc. Read more.

     Calif. adopts digital-signature law
     By Kathleen Ohlson


     California brokerage firms may enter into contracts with
     their customers through digital signatures, rather than
     filling out a pile of paperwork. 

     Gov. Gray Davis yesterday signed into California law a
     bill that allows contracts with electronic signatures to
     count as legal documents, according to a statement
     from ETrade Group Inc., one of the sponsors of the bill.
     The new law applies to firms that conduct business in
     California and their customers in all 50 states, ETrade
     said. 

     The Menlo Park, Calif.-based brokerage plans to use
     digital signatures to open and transfer customer account
     information, as well as add new privileges, such as
     margin agreements, ETrade said. The company doesn't
     know which digital signature technology it will use, but
     expects to use digital signatures "sometime in 1999,"
     said Tim Alban, a spokesman for ETrade. 

     Gomez Advisors' John Robb said while brokerages may
     sign up customers faster, they will have to overcome a
     few obstacles. There isn't any good digital signature
     technology available now for such applications, and
     digital signatures are currently not widely adopted, Robb
     said. Adopting digital signatures is a "state-by-state
     battle," since brokerages need to register in each state
     individually. However, this law is a "good first step," he
     added. 

     Online brokerages will benefit if they can automate more
     account processing and keep costs down, Robb said.

     When Melissa hit, a lot of companies just pulled the plug on their (e-mail) servers,
     losing a lot of money because of this. This is definately not the way to go in the future
     according to the security branch which is shown in the latest network security
     products. A more proactive way of working is needed and that's just what these new

     More Ammunition Used In Fight Against Viruses
     By David Drucker, InternetWeek

     In hindsight, IT managers weathered the Melissa virus pretty well. Even so, theirdefensive tactics were less than optimal.
     
     "A lot of people just disconnected [their e-mail servers], and that can't happen in the future," said Hurwitz Group analyst Diana Kelley. "The pulling-the-plug option is
     going to mean a huge loss of business, so being more proactive is going to be the way to go." 
     
     The latest network security products are designed just for that purpose. 
     
     Trend Micro is readying version 3.0 of ScanMail for Exchange, which includes tools to block unwanted file traffic until vendor patches are delivered. 
     
     When a virus outbreak begins, antivirus vendors usually design patches specifically for the new virus and distribute them to customers within a few hours. But the
     delay can be long enough to significantly stall operations. 
     
     "What we've learned from Melissa is that companies can't wait until we come up with a pattern file," said Dan Schrader, Trend Micro's vice president for new
     technology. 
     
     ScanMail for Exchange 3.0 includes the eManager plug-in, a set of content-filtering controls that let users block files based on details such as file type, file name, or
     specific wording within messages. 
     
     David Shaffer, IT manager at Power Construction, began using ScanMail a year ago when his company implemented Microsoft Exchange for its mail system. He
     said he believes the new features in version 3.0 will help him act faster the next time a major virus hits. 
     
     "This gives us a way to respond in those critical three or four hours before a patch can be released, without shutting down internal or external mail," Shaffer said. 
     
     Network Associates is also juicing up its virus-protection software. The updated version of GroupShield for Exchange can detect previously unknown viruses
     without raising excessive false alarms, the company said. The software uses so-called double heuristic technology, which detects new viruses by monitoring virus-like
     behavior. It is available now.
     
     According to a study on virus prevalence recently released by ICSA.net (formerly known as the International Computer Security Association), the rate of virus
     infections is doubling every year. The study found that a 1,000-person company experiences about 80 virus incidents per month.
     
     "espite good antivirus products, it's clear that the risk is growing," said ICSA.net chairman Peter Tippett. 
     
     The speed with which viruses are spreading is the biggest danger, Tippett said. 
     
     "It used to take a year or two for a virus to become predominant," he said. "Now it takes a day or two for Net-enabled viruses to spread. Users now have very little
     time to prepare." 
     
     Trend Micro's ScanMail for Exchange 3.0 is scheduled to ship Aug. 15. The software is priced at $5,000, without the eManager plug-in, for up to 250 users; the
     plug-in is an additional $1,250 and can be purchased for previous versions. 
     
     Network Associates' GroupShield for Exchange is available as a one-year subscription for 250 to 500 users, at a price of $29 per node, or $19 per node for 5,000
     or more users.

     Energy Secretary Orders Security Training
     
     By Tabassum Zakaria
     
     WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will announce Thursday a department-wide work stoppage to focus on security issues in August as
     another step to increase employee awareness since the China spying scandal hit the nuclear labs.
     
     The nuclear weapons research laboratories have been the focus of security concerns after a congressional report said China stole U.S. secrets on seven nuclear
     warheads and the neutron bomb. China has repeatedly denied those allegations.
     
     The labs have already had two security stand-downs this year in which work stopped so employees could focus on security issues, and will be exempt from the
     August action.
     
     Every employee must realize ``that every job carries with it a security obligation,'' Richardson said.
     
     ``I'm ordering this action to ensure that (the Energy Department) is doing everything possible to protect America's secrets and sensitive technologies,'' he said.
     
     Richardson has taken other steps such as creating a ''security czar'' position within the department and hiring a retired four-star general to fill it.
     
     The Energy Department has been criticized as having an unwieldy bureaucracy that did not pay enough attention to security concerns raised in past years.
     
     And some members of Congress want broader change and have proposed restructuring the Energy Department so the nuclear weapons programs are separated into
     a semi-autonomous agency within the department. Others have called for totally removing the nuclear programs from the department which considers the labs its
     ``crown jewels.''
     
     Energy Department sites with classified national security activities, excluding the labs, will stop routine work activities on Aug. 3 to participate in a daylong security
     training.
     
     Those sites include the Nevada Test Site, the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the Kansas City Plant, and the Pantex operation in Amarillo, Texas.
     
     By the end of August all other Energy Department facilities, including those that conduct unclassified work, will participate in a similar stand-down.
     
     Topics for non-classified areas will include computer network security, responsibilities for hosts of foreign visits, export control regulations, computer hackers and
     disgruntled employees.

     The European Commission is proceeding with infringement proceedings against nine
     member states because of their failure to comply with the data-protection directive

         Most EU states not following
              data-protection rules
                      By Elizabeth de Bony


     BRUSSELS -- The European Commission is
     proceeding with infringement proceedings against nine
     member states of the European Union for failing to
     comply with the data-protection directive that took effect
     last October, the Commission announced today. 

     The Commission has given France, Luxembourg, the
     Netherlands, Germany, the U.K., Ireland, Denmark,
     Spain and Austria two months to comply with the
     directive. Failure to meet this deadline will prompt the
     Commission to proceed with the final stage of EU
     infringement proceedings involving a complaint to the
     Luxembourg-based Court of Justice. 

     Condemnation by the Court of Justice can lead to the
     imposition of fines. 

     The data-protection directive took effect on Oct. 25,
     1998, and establishes a common regulatory framework
     for data transmission that aims to ensure both a high
     level of privacy for the individual and the free movement
     of personal data within the EU. Provisions also limit the
     transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU that
     respect similar standards of data protection. 

     These provisions have led to more than two years of
     negotiations between the EU and the U.S. over whether
     the U.S. data-protection standards -- which depend
     largely on voluntary self-regulation -- meet the directive's
     standards. These discussions are continuing, but the
     fact that nine of the 15 member states have not even
     complied with the directive has taken much of the
     urgency out of these trans-Atlantic talks. 

     To date only Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Belgium
     and Finland have fully implemented the directive.

60.0 EXPERTS WARN ABOUT NEW Y2K-THREAT

     Two of the government's top computer security experts said today at a hearing on
     Y2K and cyberterrorism before a US Senate Committee that some programmers
     hired to fix Year 2000 problems may be quietly installing malicious software codes to
     sabotage companies or gain access to sensitive information after the new year. More.

     Experts Warn of New Y2K Threat
     
                     By TED BRIDIS Associated Press Writer 
     
                     WASHINGTON (AP) - Two of the government's top computer security experts said today that some programmers
     hired to fix Year 2000 problems may be quietly installing malicious software codes to sabotage companies or gain access to sensitive
     information after the new year.
     
     The alarms were sounded at a hearing on the ``Y2K glitch'' and cyberterrorism before the Senate Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem.
     
     ``Many of these (rogue programmers) have no security clearance, do not work for the government, and yet they have access to critical systems that if sabotaged
     could wreak havoc to our financial institutions and our economy,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the committee's vice chairman.
     
     A recent analysis by the Gartner Group predicted electronic thefts worth at least $1 billion, noting that the computer networks of financial institutions, corporations
     and governments handle transactions worth $11 trillion annually.
     
     Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, said experts hired by U.S. companies to fix their computers could secretly program
     ``trap doors'' - ways to let them gain access later - or add malicious codes, such as a logic bomb or time-delayed virus that could disrupt systems.
     
     ``While systems have been and will continue to be extensively tested, the probability of finding malicious code is extremely small,'' agreed Richard Schaeffer, director
     of the Defense Department's Infrastructure and Information Assurance program.
     
     Neither expert suggested the possible scope of the problem.
     
     Schaeffer said problems are complicated by the New Year's rollover, when some computers programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year may mistake
     2000 for a full century earlier.
     
     ``It may be difficult to distinguish between a true Y2K event and some other anomaly caused by a perpetrator with malicious intent,'' Schaeffer said.
     
     Both experts said the risks were exacerbated by the amount of software repaired by companies overseas. Vatis called the situation ``a unique opportunity for foreign
     countries and companies to access, steal from or disrupt sensitive national and proprietary information systems.''
     
     Vatis recommended that companies thoroughly check the backgrounds of companies they hire for software repairs. He also said they should test for the existence of
     trap doors after the repairs, possibly even hiring teams to try to electronically crack into their own networks.
     
     The latest warnings come on the heels of new disclosures about White House plans to create a government-wide security network to protect the nation's most
     important computer systems from hackers, thieves, terrorists and hostile countries.
     
     The 148-page proposal from the Clinton administration describes building an elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to prevent and watch
     for potentially suspicious activity on federal computer systems.
     
     Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said today that the scope of the Y2K problem shows that a successful attack on a computer system - such as the network that
     controls the traffic lights or subway in New York - ``could have as much impact on the economy as if somebody actually dropped a bomb.''
     
     Civil liberties groups complain that the security tools also would make possible unprecedented electronic monitoring, especially because of the increasingly
     widespread use of computers by the government in almost every aspect of its citizens' daily lives.
     
     The White House defended the proposal.
     
     ``We are very concerned about protecting privacy rights,'' said Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger. ``But there is also a privacy right in not having
     hostile entities attack systems. We're not only talking about 17-year-old kids in their basement. We're talking about governments that we know are developing
     systems to get access to our computer systems.''
     
     The first 500 intrusion monitors would be installed on nonmilitary government computers next year, according to a draft copy of the proposal obtained by The
     Associated Press. The full system would be completed by May 2003.
     
     The plan also suggests ways to convince private companies to monitor their corporate computer networks and share information about threats. But it said explicitly
     that the government will not force companies to permit federal monitoring of their systems. ◘

61.0 WILL YOUR CABLE MODEM CENSOR THE WEB?

     According to marketing materials from Cisco Systems cable companies can make
     use of certain features in Cisco products to behind the scenes slow down and limit
     access to selected Web sites. A Cisco spokesperson said the technology is
     available to phone companies, satellite firms and major Internet service providers to
     protect customers. Protect them from what? Offensive content or the competition of

     Will Your Cable Modem Censor the Web? 

     Consumer groups balk at Cisco back-end equipment that can limit access to selected sites.
     
     by Reuters 
     July 29, 1999, 4:34 a.m. PT 
     
     A leading supplier of Internet gear for the cable industry is touting products to allow cable companies to block or restrict consumers from reaching any Web site they
     choose, drawing sharp criticism from public advocacy groups. 
     
     The revelations comes at a critical juncture for the industry, which is spending billions of dollars to roll out high-speed Internet service over cable lines while fighting national
     and local efforts to regulate their fledgling new product. 
     
     The industry has so far blunted the calls for regulation in all but two cities across the country, in part by committing to allow their customers to reach easily any Web site
     anywhere on the Internet, whether owned by a cable company or not. 
     
     Putting the Brakes on Rival Sites
     
     But according to marketing materials from Cisco Systems, the top maker of computer networking equipment, cable companies will be able to work behind the scenes with
     sophisticated software included in Cisco products to slow down and limit access to selected Web sites. 
     
     Without fully cutting off access to unaffiliated sites, the technology allows a cable company to make such destinations appear much more slowly on customers' computers
     than preferred sites, Cisco claimed in brochures distributed at a recent cable convention in Chicago. 
     
     Consumer Groups Call for Regulation
     
     "This is the owner's manual that they're providing to the cable industry to monopolize the Internet," said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education. 
     
     The non-profit Washington group, along with Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America and the Media Access Project, sent a letter Thursday to the Federal
     Communications Commission calling for regulation of cable Internet services. 
     
     The FCC has so far decided to monitor closely the cable Internet market of less than one million subscribers, compared with almost 40 million going online over ordinary
     phone lines. 
     
     The latest controversy appeared unlikely to change many minds at the agency. 
     
     "We share the same goals as the consumer groups and we believe that there should be an open system as well," said Debra Lathen, head of the agency's cable bureau.
     "Where we diverge is how you get there. We believe the market is going to mandate--to require--an open system." 
     
     "We will be very watchful; that is our obligation," Lathen added. 
     
     Thanks, But No Thanks
     
     AT&T, whose ExciteAtHome Internet provider has used some Cisco products, pledged not to use the features to discriminate against other Web sites. 
     
     "We are not in the content-management business; we're in the network management business," said spokesman Mark Siegel. 
     
     Asked if AT&T would utilize the Cisco products to limit access to any Web sites, Siegel replied: "No, we don't do that." 
     
     Cisco On the Defensive
     
     A Cisco spokesperson said the same technology was made available to all players, including phone companies, satellite firms and major Internet service providers. 
     
     "This is consistent with Cisco's open standards philosophy and commitment to competition in the marketplace," spokesman Tom Galvin said. "This technology was
     designed with customers in mind who clearly want tools to protect against offensive content such as hate or obscene material." 
     
     Cisco's marketing materials cited clearly commercial uses of the software, giving as an example a "push" Web site, which automatically downloads fresh news or other
     information to a customer's computer at set intervals. 
     
     "You could restrict the incoming push broadcasts as well as subscribers' outgoing access to the push information site to discourage its use," Cisco's brochure said. "At
     the same time, you could promote and offer your own partner's services with full-speed features to encourage adoption of your services while increasing network efficiency."

62.0 UNMASKING ANONYMOUS POSTERS
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
     From http://www.net-security.org/

     by Thejian, Thursday 29th July 1999 on 1:30 pm CET
     A new legal trend can be seen nowadays now attorneys more and more often use
     subpoenas to unmask the identities of anonymous posters to online discussion
     forums. Anyone can use that method in hopes of finding out the identity of an
     "anonymous" poster, it's a lot harder to defend yourself against it and then there are
     the other implications. Are certain groups trying to "chill" free speech? Read more
     about it here. 
     
     http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/20983.html
     
     Unmasking Anonymous Posters
     Oscar S. Cisneros 
     
     3:00 a.m.  29.Jul.99.PDT
     A new legal trend has privacy advocates up in arms: Attorneys are using subpoenas to unmask the identities of anonymous posters to online
     discussion forums. And the people whose identities are at stake rarely have the chance to fight back. 
     
     Anonymous posters can seek to quash the subpoena and preserve their anonymity, said David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy
     Information Center. But first, they have to have notice that the subpoena has been served. 
     
     
                                                     See also: Not-So-Privileged Info 
     
     
     Without notice, "there's no one in the picture that's ready to challenge the subpoena and bring it before a judge," he said. 
     
     Since subpoenas in civil lawsuits typically do not require a judge's stamp of approval, Sobel is concerned that individuals and companies are filing
     bogus lawsuits just to peel back the veil on a user's alias. 
     
     "Anyone can file a lawsuit," Sobel said. "You get a lawyer. You file a lawsuit against John Doe. And suddenly you have the authority to issue a
     subpoena." 
     
     Under their terms of service, many forum operators and ISPs promise not to divulge their users' personal information unless requested by a
     subpoena or court proceeding, Sobel said. But not all forum operators provide notice when a subpoena has been served. 
     
     Although it's not written into their terms of service agreements, both America Online and Microsoft's MSN let users know about pending subpoenas,
     Sobel said. "At least the subscriber has a fighting chance. At least they know what's going on." 
     
     Other forum operators -- notably Yahoo -- don't provide user notice. That's raised the ire of privacy advocates like Sobel and prompted users to
     erect a discussion group about the topic in one of Yahoo's forums. 
     
     "When people start to get the awareness that Yahoo is doing nothing to protect their privacy, that's going to start affecting their traffic," Sobel
     said. 
     Les French moderates a Yahoo discussion board for "Anonymous Yahoo message posters who are being sued." French started the forum after a
     former employer used a subpoena to reveal the identities behind his and other users' anonymous posts. 
     
     "They went down to court, filed a lawsuit, and subpoenaed Yahoo. They didn't send any notice to their users," French said. 
     
     "In my case, Yahoo provided them information which enabled [the company] to trace me back to Compuserve. And Compuserve, without notifying
     me, just turned over all the information in my account, including my credit card numbers. The only thing they didn't get was the password to my
     account." 
     
     Yahoo could not be reached for comment. But an attorney for the company who brought suit against French said that the company is well within
     its rights to unmask anonymous posters. 
     
     French and the other targets of the suit "essentially mixed fact with fiction" when describing the company online, said Stephan Pearson, assistant
     general counsel for Itex Corporation. Portland, Oregon-based Itex manages the records of bartering transactions between companies. 
     
     "We made the decision to unmask the identities of people who we thought were making defamatory statements about Itex Corporation," Pearson
     said. 
     
     French said that Itex has a different motivation: silencing criticism of the company's many business foibles. He said Itex has been beset by
     difficulties, including shifts in leadership, an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and being de-listed from the Nasdaq stock
     exchange for failing to file an annual report in 1998. 
     
     "I believe the reason Itex filed the suit was to chill speech -- free speech -- there on Yahoo's boards," French said, adding that financial discussion
     boards are one way to keep companies honest, and remind the board of directors that investors are watching their every action. 
     
     Pearson disagreed. 
     "Our action is a defamation-of-business kind of action and defamation has never been protected speech," he said. Some defendants named in the
     suit after they were unmasked were dropped from it when it was determined that their comments didn't harm the company in an illegal way, he
     added. 
     
     Regardless of the outcome of French and Itex's suit, privacy experts are worried the trend will only escalate without additional protections for
     consumers. 
     
     EPIC's Sobel drew into question not only Yahoo's practices, but TrustE's as well. TrustE awards seals to Web pages and companies who adhere to
     their strict privacy policy standards. 
     
     How can TrustE grant Yahoo a privacy seal when the company coughs up personal information without providing notice of a subpoena to users,
     Sobel asked. 
     
     "It's not part of our program to require that they do put the user on notice of a subpoena," said Paola Benassi, TrustE spokeswoman. "If it becomes
     an issue, we'll definitely see what makes the most sense." 
     
     Benassi defended Yahoo's privacy policy because she said it gives users notice that their information will be given out when Yahoo is served with a
     subpoena. She speculated that one cause for the lack of subpoena notice may be the volume of subpoenas, and the fact that many users are likely
     to set up accounts with false information. 
     
     Privacy advocates remain concerned. 
     
     "I think the word is rapidly spreading in the legal community that this is a great way to get information," said Sobel. "I think it is only matter of time
     before it becomes the norm in divorce cases -- the possibilities are endless."

63.0 AOL Y2KFIX: A HOAX DISGUISED AS A HOAX?

     A hoax disguised as a hoax warning is making its rounds around AOL users. It
     describes a fake "America Online Year 2000 Update" called Y2KFIX.EXE and
     allegedly fools users into giving up information on their accounts and credit cards.
     According to Symantic Y2KFIX.EXE doesn't match the characteristics of any known
     viruses. AOL also denies the existence of such an update. Story below

     AOL users hit by unusual hoax
     By Matthew Broersma, ZDNN
     July 27, 1999 3:44 PM PT

     A new hoax is making the rounds of AOL users, posing -- confusingly enough -- as a hoax
     warning. 
     
     The message, which seems to be sent by a concerned AOL (NYSE:AOL) user, describes a fake
     "America Online Year 2000 Update" called Y2KFIX.EXE. The fake message allegedly fools
     users into giving up information on their accounts and credit cards. But no such fake update exists.
     
     "There is currently no virus that has the characteristics ascribed to Y2KFIX.EXE," wrote Motoaki
     Yamamura of Symantec, in a briefing on Symantec's AntiVirus Research Center. "It is a sham,
     meant only to panic new or inexperienced computer users."
     
     Hoaxes thrive on the Internet like nowhere else, since it is so easy to pass along authentic-seeming
     messages without eliciting a closer examination. As outlined on the Department of Energy's
     "Internet Hoaxes" page, previous Internet frauds have involved everything from Blue Mountain
     Cards' greeting cards to a supposed tax on e-mail. 
     
     Message sounds real
     The Y2KFIX prank is especially perplexing because there are, in fact, many schemes designed to
     trick people into revealing their AOL passwords or other personal information. 
     
     "It sounds absolutely plausible," said AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato. 
     
     The "AOL Year 2000 Update" hoax e-mail even includes a copy of the scam
     message it is supposedly warning against. This begins, "Hello, I am Richard
     Brunner of the AOL TECH Team and we have recently finished work on this
     project which is the AOL Year 2000 Update." 
     
     This message is said to include an attachment called Y2KFIX.EXE, which,
     when executed, causes a fake AOL billing window to pop up, asking users
     for their names and credit card numbers, among other information. 
     
     "It looks very legit. It says your billing cycle was up and they need more info," the hoax e-mail
     warns. 
     
     Layers of deception
     AOL representatives say users can double-check the reality of scams at the service's
     "Neighborhood Watch" section. 
     
     "This is a rumor perpetuating a hoax pretending to be a virus," D'Amato commented. "Plato
     wouldn't even accept that as poetry." 
     
     The same trick e-mail also warms about a "flashing IM," or instant message, that will automatically
     steal your password unless you "sign off immediately." But AOL said that not only is the "flashing
     IM" a hoax, it isn't technically possible.

64.0 NO FBI SURVEILLANCE AFTER CRITICISMS

     The US Government has decided to not to blindly go through with a plan to create two
     broad, FBI-controlled computer monitoring systems to protect the nation's key data
     networks. Critics were afraid that the plan could lead to a surveillance infrastructure
     with grave potential for misuse. Some inquiries are now first more at place. ZDNet.

     U.S. backs off private monitoring
     By Maria Seminerio and Margaret Kane, ZDNN
     July 28, 1999 2:26 PM PT
     URL: 
     
     With criticism rolling in from all quarters, U.S. government officials on Wednesday backed away
     from a controversial plan to monitor private-sector networks for hacking activity. 
     
     The proposed Federal Intrusion Detection Network (FIDNET) plan, details of which were
     revealed by the New York Times Wednesday, has been in the works for at least a year, a
     National Security Council spokesman told ZDNN. The proposal for the government to monitor
     critical systems for security breaches arose out of concerns about the growing vulnerability of
     government computer networks and sensitive private-sector networks to hackers, the spokesman
     said. (The NSC advises the president on national security issues.) 
     
     But in spite of indications in a government document on the plan obtained by
     the Center for Democracy and Technology -- which indicates that private
     networks would also be watched -- the NSC spokesman denied that there is
     any plan for the surveillance of private online data. 
     
     The document outlining details of the plan says the FIDNET monitoring
     system would cover "critical government and ultimately private-sector
     information." Information gathered about network security breaches within
     one of the plan's three "pillars" -- the Department of Defense computer
     network, other federal networks and private sector networks -- "would also
     be shared with the other two pillars," according to the document. 
     
     The document coalesces with comments made by Jeffrey Hunker, senior
     director for critical infrastructure at the National Security Council, at the Black Hat Security
     Conference in Las Vegas earlier this month. "We depend on systems that were never meant to
     protect data from an organized threat," he told ZDNN. "The truth of the matter is that you all [the
     industry] own the systems that are going to be the target. It is not the federal government systems."
     
     However, in an interview with ZDNN, Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel at CDT, said: "We feel
     the government should spend its resources closing the security holes that exist, rather than to
     watch people trying to break in," Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel at CDT, said in an interview. 
     
     In spite of assurances from government officials that any monitoring would be largely automated,
     somewhere down the line a person would have to step into the process, Dempsey said -- and this
     is where such a system could be abused. 
     
     The government document detailing the plan acknowledges that "trained, experienced analysts" will
     have to step in to determine the nature of any suspected security breaches. 
     
     Looking for 'anomalous activities'
     But the NSC spokesman said the government does not plan to monitor private networks or read
     e-mail messages, but rather to "look for anomalous activities" such as evidence of denial of service
     attacks on military and other government networks. 
     
     This was little comfort to civil libertarians and other high-tech industry watchers, who blasted the
     plan as an Orwellian attack on privacy. 
     
     "I think this is a very frightening proposal," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the
     American Civil Liberties Union, in an interview. "The FBI has abused its power in the past to spy
     on political dissenters. This type of system is ripe for abuse," Steinhardt said. 
     
     "I think the threats (of network vulnerability) are completely overblown," said David Sobel,
     general counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, in an interview. The perceived
     security threat is leading to "a Cold War mentality" that threatens ordinary citizens' privacy, Sobel
     said. 
     
     "The most serious concern about this is that it could move us closer to a surveillance society," said
     Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, in an interview.
     "It's critical that if they do this, they should not retain any of the information that is gathered." 
     
     ZDNN's Robert Lemos contributed to this report.

     US regulators (read: Federal Trade Commision) yesterday took action against a
     Canada-based company that allegedly sold phony Y2K credit card protection against
     Y2K-related problems. This is said to be a first in a series of Y2K-fraud prevention by
     the FTC. The case was settled with $ 100.000 fine. Wired.

     US regulators took action Wednesday against a company that allegedly sold phony Y2K credit card protection packages through a large-scale
     telemarketing effort. 
     
     The Federal Trade Commission said the company, Canada-based NCCP Ltd., pretended to represent customers' credit card companies, and offered
     plans to cover theft of cards and special packages to protect against Y2K-related problems. However, the so-called packages contained only
     adhesive stickers, the FTC said. 
     
     FTC officials said Wednesday's action was its first enforcement measure concerning a Y2K-related fraud. 
     
     As part of an agreement with regulators, NCCP agreed to pay US$100,000 to settle charges that they falsely represented a credit card protection
     program.

     Red Hat, a maker of Linux open source software, introduced an e-commerce server package Tuesday that's designed to move small businesses more quickly onto
     the Internet. The Red Hat Linux E-Commerce server combines Red Hat's Linux 6.0 open source operating system, which supports up to four processors with
     symmetric multiprocessing configuration, with the Apache Web open source server. Integrated into the e-commerce server is RSA Data Security's 128-bit
     encryption engine. 
     
     The server package includes Red Hat's Linux 6.0 applications CD, containing applications such as Star Division's StarOffice, which offers word processing,
     spreadsheet, graphic design, presentation, HTML editor, e-mail/news reader, event planner, formula editor, and other applications. The CD also features IBM's
     ViaVoice voice-recognition software and Applix's Applixware for Linux, a full-office suite including a developer bundle. 
     
     Also included in the server package is an e-commerce directory with offerings such as HP's WebQoS, which lets users prioritize Web server traffic based on
     business criteria, electronic shopping-cart software from MiniVend, and a credit card processing engine from CCVS. 
     
     As part of the Apache Web server, the Apache ASP module offers multiplatform development, while the Apache DAV module lets users edit, manage, and publish

67.0 HACKING IN 1999 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/       
     
     by BHZ, Monday 26th July 1999 on 4:42 pm CET
     Our new Special Report, written by anonymous, gives you a retrospective on the past
     year's underground happenings. "What is a hacker these days? Someone who uses a
     web browser to hack remote systems? Or is a hacker still defined as it was originally.
     Hacking is mostly about gaining access to a remote system, not showing off that you
     outsmarted an admin". You can read about security bugs, hack groups and incidents
     that marked 1999, in our Special Report entitled Hacking in 1999 | The Current State
     of Hacking.      
     
        
           Hacking in 1999 | The Current State of Hacking. 
     
                                     
     
      Major Exploits released in 1999
     
      In 1999, many things have happened, the allaire cold fusion bug has been widely
      advertised and put to use, many servers were compromised by using it, if
      you look to allot of the website defacement mirror sites, almost all were done
      by the cold fusion method. Yet another easy bug has been released in 1999
      by eEye Digital Security Team, this bug was for the Microsoft IIS server, and
      again many people have used this method to make a name for themselves.
      After looking at exploits like this, it makes you wonder what a hacker is these
      days? Someone who uses a web browser to hack remote systems? Or is a
      hacker still defined as it was originally. Hacking is mostly about gaining
      access to a remote system, not showing off that you outsmarted an admin.
     
       
     
      Major Incidents that have Affected the 'Scene'
     
      The first major incident the busting of Eric Burns AKA Zyklon. When companies
      pressed lawsuits against him for thousands of dollars because he broke into their
      servers.Up to now he is still not allowed to touch a computer I assume.
     
       
     
      The second incident was the raiding of members of the well known group gH a.k.a
      global Hell. An approximate 19 people were raided if not more, not only from
      gH but from other groups such as Level Seven, team spl0it, milw0rm and
      IL(Iron Lungs) from HcV/Legion2000 and forpaxe. 
     
       
     
      Kevin Mitnick was screwed around 2+ times, with them changing his court
      date around continuously and him now having to owe 1 mil.
     
      Read more about it at 2600, also support the FREE KEVIN movement.
     
       
     
      Just recently, a few incidents have happened as a result of John Veransevich
      otherwise known as JP from AntiOnline. First, Attrition makes a good
      accusation that JP indeed funded a hacker known as 'so1o' to deface the
      Senate Government website for him just to make a breaking news story
      (Although, I am not accusing him of doing this, because it was never
      proven). Another thing you notice about the "Anti Network" is the AntiCode
      website, which claims to be "the only place you need" for all of your
      exploits/network/security tools and utilities. But in reality this site is nothing
      more than an archive compiled from other known sites and the code ripped
      by AntiOnline it's self. Second MAJOR incident was when JP shut down a
      popular IRC server. And the third, probably most devastating to the
      underground community, was when JP caused Packetstorm Security to
      shut down, all of Ken Williams files were deleted forever, his work ruined.
      Not to mention many other things. You can read all those other things at : 
     
      http://www.attrition.org/negation/index2.html
     
       
     
      A few conventions have passed, such as Defcon, Defcon is probably the most
      recognized of all hacker conventions, this year some major things happened
      at this convention, they had a line-up of great speakers, Carolyn P. Meinel
      showed up and was not allowed in because she was accused of not being a
      'real' reporter (which I will not comment on), and shortly into the Defcon
      convention, their website was defaced by the very well know coding group
      known as ADM. Also Rootfest and the Blackhat Briefings have recently
      passed by.
     
       
     
      Who has showed up?
     
      Many new groups and individuals have showed up in 1999 up to now. To mention a
      few. and give a decent description of them and their actions + skills.
     
       
     
      Groups
     
      Forpaxe - Forpaxe showed up in early 99, they have been responsible for hitting a
      record number of .edu domains also quite a few .gov/.mil and numerous others. They
      are well known to all hackers and media. A member of the past groups Legion2000
      and HcV was a part of this group in the beginning, Iron Lungs, which later got raided
      by the FBI. Now it appears to just be 2 individuals (m1crochip/in0de) which they state
      on all of their webpage defacements. They do what they do for a reason, so they are
      a decent group of individuals as far as I am concerned.
     
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements
      http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/forpax.html
     
       
     
      Goat Security - This organization is a definite mentionable, everybody knows and
      remembers the goat team, it consisted of members of gH, HcV and I think even a few
      from LoU. They defaced a good amount of websites and made a widely known name
      for themselves. They definitely knew what they were doing, not like all of the CF(cold
      fusion) kiddies you see around these days.
     
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements
      http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/goat.html
       
     
      gH (global Hell) - Possibly the most world wide known hacker group and most
      media exposed, gH defaced allot of high profile websites such as Macweek,
      Peoples Court, The Main Army Page and the Whitehouse. Many members
      were later raided by FBI agents due to the defacing of the Whitehouse
      website. They have skill and as far I saw it a very good team of people. This
      group will always be remembered.
     
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements
      http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/gh.html
       
     
      Level Seven - This crew was responsible for numerous defacements, it is rumored
      also and stated on some of their defacements that members of this group were a part
      of gH (global Hell) and got raided. This group was another group that hacked for a
      decent reason. Mentionable mostly because of their tie-ins with gH. None the less
      they are a good group.
     
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements
      http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/l7.html
       
     
      Stonehenge Crew - Not very much to say about this group other than they have a
      purpose for what they do. They always have a reason for defacing a website they hit.
      They have done around 14 webpage defacements. It is rumored they are also 'tight'
      with the known group gH. This is another good group.
     
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements
      http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/henge.html
     
       
     
      Keebler Elves - Well, this group is probably the most skilled up to now in 1999.
      Many skilled individuals, coders and hacker alike in it, from what is said at least.
      They are best known for their hacks of the Department of Education, Virgin
      Records and the Monmouth Army Base. Probably has done the most
      recognized sites in 1999. And I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to hack
      big time names. This group deserves allot of respect. Why? Because they
      aren't like the rest.
     
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements
      http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/keebler.html
       
     
      HFD (Hacking for Drunks) - This is another group well known for it's choice of sites
      to deface. Probably most well recognized for their 20th Century Fox International,
      Gibson and Blair Witch website hacks. They seem to have a good sense of
      humor and have done some entertaining defacements. Very good group. But
      name/logo kind of ripped from HFG(Hacking For Girls).
     
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements
      http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/hfd.html
       
     
      bl0w team - A good Brazilian hackers group, consisting of 5 individuals, best noted
      for their 2600.co.uk and Telemar hacks. They do it all for an adequate reason
      and do not give up. I think there patriotism is admirable. They also seem to
      have a good amount of skill dealing with Solaris/NT systems.

      INDIANHackers/EHA/Ant1 S3cur1ty Tskf0rc3/MST(Moscow Security Team)
     
      Nothing special, not really even worth the time, they did a 'few' sites and were never
      heard from again. None of them had really any reason for defacing websites other
      than to make themselves look big. Ant1 S3cur1ty Taskf0rc3 did a few with reason,
      but it was rare with these 4 groups.

      There are other individuals I missed and they all deserve respect and to be noticed, I
      didn't for get them because I dislike them, just because this part of the article has
      gone far enough.
     
       
     
      What was hit?
     
      Aside from all the no-name sites that were hacked. In 1999 there has been several
      HIGH PROFILE web defacements. Below is a list with a link to the defaced site,
      provided by Attrition.
     
         - Klu Klux Klan 
         - LOD Communication 
         - 200cigarettes Movie 
         - Whitepride 
         - No Limit Records 
         - Hotbot Search Engine 
         - Summercon 
         - eBay 
         - Coca Cola (BE) 
         - US Senate 
         - HBO, Latin America 
         - The White House 
         - Army Main Site 
         - and so many more.... 
     
       
     
      Why do they do it?
     
      MOST of the time it is to make a name and become known/noticed, but on some
      occasions people do it for a reason, to prove faulty security, to protest against a
      certain problem in the world or a personal dispute. 
     
      Well that pretty much covers 1999. Most of the remembered parts up to now
      anyways.

     Y2K TEST for DOS is a millennium bug diagnostic and repair utility used to test how
     a PC will handle year 2000 dates and beyond. The included fix restores year 2000
     compliance by installing a device driver that compensates for non-compliant real-time
     clocks, thereby fixing BIOS bugs including the Award 4.50G BIOS problem. Just to
     note it is updated version of the program we wrote about earlier.

70.0 BELL CANADA Y2K TEST
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/
     
     by BHZ, Saturday 24th July 1999 on 11:05 pm CET
     Bell Canada (www.bell.ca), telephone operator in Canada was working hard on
     preparing new Y2K-ready system, and yesterday they transferred 7500 customer to
     the new system. It all worked good for 3 hours, but then the system crashed. So
     those "lucky ones" couldn't use their phone services for couple of hours, until it was
     all fixed.

     Synopsis:     Potential misuse of squid cachemgr.cgi
     Advisory ID:       RHSA-1999:025-01

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     
     1. Topic:
     
     
     cachemgr.cgi, the manager interface to Squid, is installed by
     default in /home/httpd/cgi-bin. If a web server (such as apache)
     is running, this can allow remote users to sent connect() requests
     from the local machine to arbitrary hosts and ports.
     
     
     2. Bug IDs fixed:
     
     
     3. Relevant releases/architectures:

     Red Hat Linux 5.2, all architectures

     5. Conflicts with:
     
     
     6. RPMs required:
     
     
     Red Hat Linux 6.0:
     
     
     Intel:

     7. Problem description:
     
     
     A remote user could enter a hostname/IP address and port
     number, and the cachemgr CGI would attempt to connect to that
     host and port, printing the error if it fails.
     
     
     8. Solution:
     
     
     For each RPM for your particular architecture, run:
     rpm -Uvh &lt;filename>
     where filename is the name of the RPM.
     
     
     Alternatively, you can simply disable the cachemgr.cgi,
     by editing your http daemons access control files or
     deleting/moving the cachemgr.cgi binary.
     
     
     9. Verification:

     1999-07-29: Add note about %postun of Red Hat Linux 6.0 samba release.
     
     
     1. Topic:
     
     
     Samba 2.0.5a has been released. Among the fixes in this release
     are several security issues present in previous Samba releases.

     4. Obsoleted by:
     
     
     5. Conflicts with:
     
     
     The smbmount code shipped with Samba 2.0 is only compatible
     with the Linux 2.2 kernel, so it has not been built for
     the Red Hat Linux 4.2 and 5.2 releases. If smbmount
     support for the 2.2 kernel is needed under Red Hat Linux
     4.2 or 5.2, the source RPM can be rebuilt with the following
     command line (RPM version 3.0 is required):
     
     
     rpm --define "KERN22 yes" --rebuild samba-2.0.5a-&lt;release>.src.rpm
     
     
     
     The samba package shipped with Red Hat Linux 6.0 (samba-2.0.3-8)
     has an erroneous post-uninstall script. If this package is upgraded
     to the errata release, it could cause  /var/log/samba and
     /var/lock/samba to be missing. It is recommended that users
     of samba under Red Hat Linux 6.0 uninstall the previous release
     using 'rpm -e samba' before installing the errata release.
     
     
     6. RPMs required:

     7. Problem description:
     
     
     Several security issues were present in earlier samba releases.
     - a denial-of-service attack could be performed against nmbd.
     - a buffer overflow was present in the message service in smbd
       (not enabled by default under Red Hat Linux)
     - a race condition was present in smbmnt that could cause problems
       if installed setuid root (it is not installed setuid root by
       default under Red Hat Linux 6.0, and is not present under Red
       Hat Linux 4.2 or 5.2)
     
     
     Thanks go to Olaf Kirch (okir@caldera.de) for discovering the
     security holes, as well as the Samba team.
     
     
     8. Solution:
     
     
     Install the updated RPMs, and restart the affected services by
     running:
     
     
     /etc/rc.d/init.d/smb restart
     
     
     For each RPM for your particular architecture, run:
     rpm -Uvh &lt;filename>
     where filename is the name of the RPM.
     
     
     9. Verification:

                    Systems Affected

                         Cobalt Networks RaQ2 single rack unit Internet servers 

       I. Description

       A vulnerability has been discovered in the default configuration of Cobalt Networks RaQ2 servers that allows remote users to install arbitrary software packages to
       the system. RaQ2 servers are configured with an administrative webserver to process remote requests to manage the unit. Systems installed with the default
       configuration have insufficient access control mechanisms to prevent remote users from adding arbitrary software packages to the system using this webserver. 

       A document published by Cobalt Networks describes the vulnerability and solutions in more detail: 

            http://www.cobaltnet.com/support/security/index.html 

       II. Impact

       Any remote user who can establish a connection to an administrative port on a vulnerable RaQ2 server can install arbitrary software packages on the server. This
       access can then be used to gain root privileges on the system. 

       III. Solution

       Configure your Systems to Guard Against this Vulnerability 

       Install the patches provided by Cobalt Networks:

     Summary
     
     ======
     
     Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in the Phone Dialer accessory in Microsoft« Windows NT«. The
     vulnerability could be used to run arbitrary code in a userÆs security context on Windows NT systems.
     
     Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found

     Issue
     
     ====
     
     Dialer.exe has an unchecked buffer in the portion of the program that processes the dialer.ini file. This vulnerability could be used to run arbitrary
     code via a classic buffer overrun technique.
     
     The circumstances of this vulnerability require a fairly complicated attack scenario that limits its scope. Dialer.exe runs in the security context of
     the user, so it would not benefit an attacker to simply modify a dialer.ini file and run it, as he or she would not gain additional privileges. Instead,
     the attacker would need to modify the dialer.ini file of another user who had higher privileges, then wait for that user to run Dialer.
     
     Although the unchecked buffer is present in all versions of Windows NT 4.0, the attack scenario would result in workstations that have dial-out
     capability being chiefly at risk. The FAQ discusses this in greater detail.

75.0 Senate asks for input into information infrastructure protection plan

     JULY 29, 1999 . . . 18:15 EDT 


     Citing privacy concerns, Senate asks for input into
     information infrastructure protection plan

     BY DIANE FRANK (diane_frank@fcw.com)

     The Senate today urged federal officials to brief Congress on a Clinton
     administration plan to protect the federal information infrastructure from
     cyberattacks. The request followed stories this week in the general press that
     inaccurately reported that the draft plan would have the FBI monitor
     interactions with government computers.

     During a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on
     the Year 2000 Technology Problem, Sen. Bob
     Bennett (R-Utah) and Sen. Christopher Dodd
     (D-Conn.) both called for the draft plan to be released
     to Congress and asked for a closed briefing within the
     next few weeks.

     The National Plan for Information Systems Protection is being developed by the
     Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO), the National Infrastructure
     Protection Center (NIPC), and other high-level officials and groups within the
     government. It is based on the critical infrastructure protection plans from
     agencies and industry required by Presidential Decision Directive 63 and was
     originally scheduled to be sent to Congress and the president this fall, according
     to John Tritak, director of the CIAO.

     Published stories based on a copy of the June 7 draft of the plan that was
     leaked to a public interest group raised several concerns that the senators felt
     Congress should know more about, including privacy issues surrounding the
     monitoring inherent in the proposed Federal Intrusion Detection Network
     (FIDnet). 

     "The issues, and specifically the FIDnet proposal reported by the [New York]
     Times, should be the subject of oversight by the Congress, which has yet to
     receive an official copy of the plan," Bennett said. "I am confident, given the
     timing of today's hearing, that a copy of the national plan will be forthcoming
     and that the oversight process can begin."

76.0 FBI: Beware outside Y2K workers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     (Online News, 07/29/99 11:43 AM)



      FBI: Beware outside Y2K workers
                      By Patrick Thibodeau


     WASHINGTON -- Private companies that have used outside
     firms to complete year 2000 repair work are running the risk
     that their systems have been compromised, a top Federal
     Bureau of Investigation official warned a congressional
     committee today. 

     Michael Vatis, a deputy assistant director at the FBI and
     director of the National Infrastructure Protection Center, said
     he is concerned that Y2K contractors, both foreign and
     domestic, have used the Y2K remediation process to install
     malicious code. 

     Vatis said the FBI doesn't have "concrete indications" that
     any group is planning to "to engage in unlawful intrusions" at
     the New Year. But the FBI is nonetheless expecting trouble,
     he said in testimony prepared for today's hearing by the
     U.S. Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000
     Technology Problem. 

     Y2K contractors could compromise systems by installing
     trap doors, obtaining root access, implanting malicious
     code or mapping systems with the intent of selling
     information to economic competitors or foreign intelligence
     agencies. 

     Those with the motives and the means to compromise
     systems include foreign governments for information
     warfare purposes, as well as those engaged in industrial
     espionage, terrorism or organized crime, said Vatis. 

     The FBI expects to see increased and possibly violent
     activities among certain domestic groups. For instance, the
     coming of the millennium requires Christian Identity
     adherents to prepare for the "Second Coming of Christ" by
     taking violent action against their enemies. That kind of
     activity raises the possibility there could also be an increase
     in activity in the cyberworld, Vatis said in his testimony. 

     Given "the vulnerabilities [that] could be implanted in critical
     systems," said Vatis, "it is imperative that the client
     companies do as much as possible to check the
     background of the companies doing their remediation work,
     oversee the remediation process closely, and review new
     code as closely as possible and remove any extraneous
     code." 

     Moreover, Vatis advised companies to create "red teams" to
     try to crack their software and determine if trap doors exist.

78.0 NSA spying on Americans? 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     

     Big Brother Is Listening But Is He Breaking the Law When He Does It? 

     Some fear the United StatesÆ biggest spy
     agency is using new technology to spy
     illegally on Americans. (Thomas
     Schmid/ABCNEWS.com)
                                                        
 
     By David Ruppe
     ABCNEWS.com
     N E W  Y O R K, July 27 ù Is Uncle Sam illicitly
     reading your e-mail? Listening in on your
     telephone calls? Scanning your faxes?
          Some in Congress suspect advances in communications
     technology in recent years may have enabled AmericaÆs
     biggest, and most secret, spy agency, the National Security
     Agency, to greatly increase its eavesdropping powers at the
     expense of AmericansÆ privacy.
          But they canÆt be sure without a thorough congressional
     examination into the agencyÆs practices. And, they say, the
     NSA has not yet provided all the information requested by
     the House Select Intelligence Committee, which is looking
     into the question.
          That the National Security Agency intercepts
     AmericansÆ missives is clear. Observers point to the
     agencyÆs practice of intercepting massive volumes of
     communications through spy satellites and by listening to
     commercial communications satellites, which inevitably
     draws in the communications of U.S. citizens for whom the
     agency has no court order. 
          ôI have a problem with what the program appears to be
     doing, and that is, invading the privacy rights of American
     citizens without any reason, any court order, without any
     reasonable cause, without any probable cause, almost a
     dragnet invasion of privacy,ö says Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
     one of the NSAÆs most outspoken critics. 
 
     Intercepting U.S. Communications 
     Government officials admit the NSAÆs collection methods
     do draw in communications made by U.S. citizens.
          ôRead the statute, the executive order, the legislative
     history, and what youÆll find is the underlying assumption is
     that you canÆt avoid collecting U.S.-person information
     incidentally if you are going to do foreign intelligence
     collection,ö says an official familiar with the agency.
          The NSA maintains that it follows the laws and
     procedures Congress approved in the 1970s and 1980s for
     analyzing, retaining and disseminating that information,
     which were designed to balance the agencyÆs needs for
     gathering information with citizensÆ privacy rights as
     guaranteed by the ConstitutionÆs Fourth Amendment.
          According to classified procedures described by
     government officials, if the NSA incidentally obtains a
     communication made by or to a U.S. citizen or organization
     in the United States for which there is no warrant or court
     order, the NSA can keep the message but must remove the
     name of the citizen or company.
          The law also includes an exception: The name of the
     person can be retained in the message, included in analysis,
     and disseminated within the government, the official familiar
     with the agency notes, if NSA officials judge it is
     ônecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or
     assess its importance.ö
          ôThere are always judgments: æIs it necessary to
     understand the foreign intelligence requirements?Æ And
     people have to make those difficult choices all of the time,ö
     the official says. ôAll I can tell you is, [they] err on the side
     of caution.ö 
 
     Limited Oversight 
     Still, critics say there is no way to be sure the NSAÆs
     judgments consistently respect citizensÆ rights unless the
     congressional committees responsible for overseeing those
     rights have full access to information on how the agency
     applies the laws.
          The chairman of the the House Select Intelligence
     Committee, Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., has asked for all legal
     opinions and guidance provided by the NSAÆs legal office to
     the agency. Such guidance, which is supplied to the NSAÆs
     operations employees and other decision-makers, could
     show how the agency is applying the laws that restrict
     collection of information on Americans.
          Goss has not asserted that the NSAÆs collection
     activities are breaking the law. But he does seem concerned
     ù like Barr ù that the agency, through its interpretation of
     the laws, may be assuming greater powers ôin light of the
     enormous technological advances that have been made in
     the past several years.ö
          The committee needs the information ôto be sure the
     NSA General CounselÆs Office was interpreting NSAÆs
     legal authorities correctly and that NSA was not being
     arbitrary and capricious in its execution of its mission,ö he
     wrote.
          The NSAÆs General CounselÆs office has turned over
     some of the legal guidance, but it has declined to surrender
     all such communications, invoking, in a most unusual move,
     executive privilege. 
 
     Unreasonable Request? 
     The fact that the NSA is not turning over all of the
     requested information suggests Fourth Amendment rights
     against unreasonable searches and seizures may be in
     jeopardy, says Barr, a former CIA analyst who is not on the
     committee. ôIt certainly raises that suspicion and it doesnÆt
     serve them well to do that.ö
          BarrÆs suspicions seem to have found sympathy in the
     House, which amended its Intelligence Reauthorization bill
     with a provision by Barr that would require the NSA to
     make an annual report explaining its interpretation of the
     laws, including all materials showing its interpretation. 
          
 
     Intelligence Gathering Regulation in
     America
 
     1789 to 1966: Electronic surveillance basically was not
     regulated. 
     1928: The Supreme Court rules in Olmstead vs. United
     States that a wiretap on a phone did not violate Fourth
     Amendment rights against search and seizure. 
     1934: Congress enacts the Federal Communications Act,
     which prohibited the interception of any communications and
     the divulgence of the contents of intercepted
     communications by federal agents without a court order or a
     warrant. 
     1966: The Supreme Court rules in Katz vs. United States
     that basically all forms of eavesdropping require a warrant or
     court order. It ruled the Fourth Amendment allows for the
     protection of a person, not just a personÆs property, against
     illegal searches, so that whatever a citizen ôseeks to
     preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public,
     may be constitutionally protected.ö 
     1968: Congress codifies the Katz decision. Establishes
     requirements for obtaining a warrant, including
     demonstrating probable cause to a court, and limits to
     warrants. Sec. 2511 of the statute says warrants still are not
     needed for foreign intelligence electronic surveillance and
     national security surveillance. 
     1972: Supreme Court rules in 1972 that domestic security
     cases are law enforcement cases, not foreign intelligence
     cases, and so require a warrant to target a U.S. citizen. If
     there is a connection to a foreign power or agent of a foreign
     power then no court order is needed. 
     1975-1976: Church and Pike Committee investigations,
     specially ordered by Congress, expose government
     electronic surveillance collection, processing, retention, and
     dissemination of information on U.S. citizens. 
     1976 & 1977: Senate, then House, creates Select
     Intelligence Committee for overseeing activities of the U.S.
     intelligence community. 
     1978: Congress passes Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
     Act, that regulates foreign intelligence electronic
     surveillance. It requires a special court order procedure to
     authorize electronic surveillance for intelligence purposes on
     targeted U.S. persons. Ensuing regulations, which are
     classified, set out procedures for handling foreign
     intelligence electronic surveillance. 
 
 
 
     The NSAÆs position has been it has nothing to hide and has
     no problem fulfilling requests for specific information. But as
     last Thursday, the agency continued to view the
     committeeÆs request for all legal opinions and discussions as
     unreasonable.
          ô[They] have no problem providing information on any
     subject,ö says the government official familiar with the
     agency, who explained the NSAÆs position. ôBut there has
     got to be some principle. The executive branch has to retain
     some information.ö
          Turning over all legal guidance to the committee, the
     official argued, would be an enormous task and might also
     discourage employees from seeking the legal officeÆs advice
     in the future. 
 
     æCloak of SecrecyÆ 
     Goss, in a May committee report, rejected such arguments
     out of hand, reminding the agency of its legal requirement to
     furnish ôany information or material concerning intelligenceö
     requested by the House and Senate intelligence committees.
          The agencyÆs refusal to release information requested by
     the committee could ôseriously hobble the legislative
     oversight process,ö and would ôresult in the envelopment of
     the executive branch in a cloak of secrecy,ö he wrote the
     chairman.
          ôWithout access to such documents, Congress would be
     left only with the æspinÆ the executive branch agency opted
     to provide to the legislative branch,ö Goss wrote.
          Barr concurs.
          ô[NSA officials] are not the ones to tell the oversight
     folks what they can see,ö he says. ôIf they can, then there is
     hollow oversight, and thatÆs arrogance.ö
 
                                                  
      X-Files or Reality? 
      If you think suspicions of government eavesdropping on
      Americans sounds more like the stuff of the TV show
      X-Files than reality, you only have to go back to the 1970s
      to be dissuaded.
           Congressional hearings then revealed the NSA had
      been engaging in serious abuses of U.S. citizensÆ Fourth
      Amendment rights. In short, the agency had been
      eavesdropping on hundreds of controversial American
      figures who had nothing to do with foreign intelligence,
      such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., had delivered the
      intercepted information to other agencies, and had kept
      files on the figures. 
           Following the hearings, Congress in 1978 passed the
      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, restricting to a large
      extent the spy agencyÆs ability to collect information on
      Americans. The House and Senate Select Intelligence
      Committees were created to oversee the agencies. 
           Few experts now believe the NSA could be doing
      anything so serious today. 
           ôIf you ask me whether they are consciously ignoring all
      of those restrictions, my best guess would be no,ö says
      Jeffrey Richelson, an intelligence analyst with the
      nongovernmental, nonprofit National Security Archive. ôThis
      is not the Vietnam War, this is not that period of time, and
      Nixon is not president.ö
           James Bamford, author of the definitive book on the
      NSA, The Puzzle Palace, agrees. ôI donÆt think itÆs as big a
      problem as some out there are pushing it,ö he says.
           ôOn the other hand, it has been 25 years since thereÆs
      been a real hard-nosed congressional probe into
      intelligence, so they could probably get away with quite a
      bit at this point.ö
           According to an official familiar with the NSA, in the
      1970s the agency abandoned practices designed to get
      around the laws such as ôreverse targeting.ö Reverse
      targeting occurred when an NSA employee purposely
      conducted a search on an approved subject so that he
      could collect information on a person for whom there was
      no warrant.
           ôTo talk about what NSA used to do in the 1960s and
      1970s, conclude thatÆs what [theyÆre] doing now à is just
      living in a dream world,ö says the official. ôThat simply isnÆt
      reality.ö

79.0 AOL messaging policy might risk cable deals

     AOL messaging policy might risk cable deals 
     By Reuters
     Special to CNET News.com 
     July 27, 1999, 3:25 a.m. PT 
     URL: http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,39758,00.html 
     
     America Online might back off efforts to block rival "instant messaging" services because the actions threaten to undermine its lobbying push to get access to high-speed
     cable Internet lines, public policy analysts said yesterday.
     
     Over the past few days, engineers at the No. 1 online service worked diligently to thwart efforts by Microsoft and Yahoo to allow consumers using their messaging
     products to connect with AOL customers and accounts.
     
     So-called instant messaging programs are used by tens of millions of Internet surfers to send and receive quick text messages that pop up immediately on the computer
     screens of their online pals. AOL is by far the market leader, with more than 80 million users of its two instant messaging products.
     
     AOL executives offered a variety of explanations for their efforts to block competitors' access, including that Microsoft had put the security and privacy of their
     customers at risk--a charge Microsoft vehemently denied.
     
     But analysts said that even if AOL was factually correct in some of its arguments, the moves would hurt the company's credibility on the cable open access issue where
     it is pushing to have exclusive deals banned.
     
     Cable companies have required customers buying high-speed net access over cable lines to also buy Internet services like email and Web page hosting from them. The
     exclusive deals are unfair to other Internet service providers, AOL argues.
     
     "Open is open," said Legg Mason Precursor Group analyst Scott Cleland, who has long predicted that AOL will ultimately prevail and gain access to cable high-speed
     Internet services. "When you're denying consumers a choice of something, it looks bad in any case."
     
     Online analyst Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, predicted AOL's position on cable access would ultimately trump its decision to close up its instant
     messaging product.
     
     Cable companies like AT&T "will use AOL's instant messaging position as a defense," Arlen said. "Cable open access is truly the much bigger, longer-term issue. I don't
     know how the IM deal is going to work but I think that one will get settled."
     
     In fact, AT&T general counsel Jim Cicconi did just as Arlen predicted, issuing a statement calling AOL's moves "hypocritical and antithetical to the very ethos of the
     Internet."
     
     Some of AOL's supporters on the cable issue noted that cable was a regulated monopoly running on public property, as opposed to AOL's development of a software
     product for the unregulated Internet. But few seemed eager to enter the instant messaging fray on the record.
     
     Until recently, each of the various instant messaging products was a separate and incompatible communications tool, allowing contact only with others using the same
     product.
     
     Microsoft last week introduced a product called MSN Messenger that promised communications with people using AOL's instant messenger as well.
     
     To make the feat possible, Microsoft's messenger software asked users for their AOL user name and password. The information was not sent to Microsoft but allowed
     the Microsoft software to log users into AOL's network.
     
     AOL then changed the way its network was set up so Microsoft users were blocked out. Microsoft responded with a quick fix and, after several rounds, Microsoft said
     late yesterday that its newest version was communicating with AOL users.
     
     "There's a right way and a wrong way," said AOL spokeswoman Ann Brackbill, defending her company's right to block MSN. "But without the right coordination and
     standards, the privacy and security of consumers is going to be at risk."
     
     AOL will support the development of a universal Internet standard for connecting all instant messaging software, Brackbill added.
     
     "The only issue here is how the industry will work together to overcome the technical obstacles to interconnecting the various IM systems," she said.
     
     Microsoft product manager Deanna Sanford said AOL had in the past declined to support such an industry-wide effort underway at the Internet Engineering Task
     Force, a consensus-based standards writing body.
     
     "Ultimately, it would be great if we could all support some standards," Sanford said. "It would be great if AOL would."

80.0 Study calls for reserve virtual IT warfare unit
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     http://www.fcw.com/pubs/fcw/1999/0726/fcw-newsreserve-07-26-99.html
     
     JULY 26, 1999 


     Study calls for reserve virtual IT warfare unit

     BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

     A year-long study completed last week by a senior panel of Defense
     Department officials recommended an unprecedented expansion in the role the
     reserves play in national defense, including the formation of a virtual
     cyberdefense unit to protect the nation's critical infrastructure.

     The study, Reserve Component Employment Study 2005, was initiated in April
     1998 at the request of Defense Secretary William Cohen and concluded that the
     reserves are "particularly well-suited to homeland defense missions." In addition,
     the study called for the formation of a "joint [reserve component] virtual
     information operations organization" and tasked various senior-level DOD
     organizations to complete a "proof of concept" study for creating the unit by
     June 30, 2000.

     The new reserve cyberdefense unit "would consist of individuals with
     information technology skills who could perform their duties from dispersed
     locations rather than working as a single consolidated unit at a specific training
     center," the report said. To accomplish their mission of protecting various critical
     infrastructure nodes, the unit would communicate from existing reserve centers
     and other DOD facilities across the country that have access to the Secret
     Internet Protocol Routing Network.

     To form the new unit, the study recommended looking for reserve members in
     regions of the country where high concentrations of IT skill already exist. 

     In addition, the study suggested that the reserves consider recruiting
     high-tech-savvy people from the civilian sector, requiring them to join the
     reserves for a specific number of years in exchange for high-tech training
     provided by DOD.

     Establishing a "virtual organization" also would go a long way toward solving the
     department's problem of retaining personnel with critical IT skills and may allow
     DOD to reduce its reliance on external contractor support, the report said. "A
     'virtual organization' [also] could support the Joint Task Force [for] Computer
     Network Defense," the report said. Cohen established the JTF-CND in
     December 1998 to monitor and take defensive actions against hackers and other
     unauthorized users who try to penetrate DOD networks.

     Rick Forno, a security officer for Network Solutions Inc. and the former senior
     security analyst at the House of Representatives' Information Resources
     Security Office, said the report's recommendation to use the reserves for cyber
     defense "is a great idea" and represents one of DOD's more innovative
     initiatives. "I'm thrilled that DOD is looking to go outside the box on the
     Info-Protect/InfoCorps idea in the reserve components," said Forno, who
     proposed a similar idea to DOD a year ago. However, "it comes down to
     endorsement and support from senior leadership [whether or not] they let this
     organization function as intended," he said.

     Anthony M. Valletta, vice president of C3I systems for SRA Federal Systems
     and former acting assistant secretary of Defense for command, control,
     communications and intelligence, said the concept of using the reserves in this
     manner is one that the intelligence community has proven works. 

     "When we did this with the intelligence community, it worked extremely well,"
     Valletta said. "We have a lot of expertise in the reserves that we need to take
     advantage of."

     The main challenge facing the reserve cyberdefense corps idea, according to
     Valletta, is training and equipping the reserves to carry out the mission. "We
     have to keep up with the technology, and the reserves have to have the latest
     capabilities," Valletta said. "That is a major change of philosophy in terms of
     equipping the reserves."

     However, the idea of establishing a JTF for Homeland Defense also is an idea
     that some groups, particularly civil liberties organizations, may question.

     "The main issue is the Posse Comitatus Act and the limits on military activity
     within the U.S.," said Mark Lowenthal, former deputy assistant secretary of
     State for intelligence and now a member of Valletta's C3I consulting team at
     SRA. "If it is limited to what are clearly DOD facilities, then there should be no
     problem," he said. "If it steps over that line, then there are some legal issues that
     have to be addressed."

     Other recommendations contained in the report include using the reserves as
     part of a Joint Task Force headquarters for Homeland Defense, which would
     work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other civil
     authorities to coordinate responses to attacks involving nuclear, chemical and
     biological weapons, and increasing the use of smart card technology to reduce
     delays in processing reserve members for active-duty assignments.

                    intruders exploit three different RPC service vulnerabilities; however, similar artifacts have been found on compromised systems. 

                    Vulnerabilities we have seen exploited as a part of these attacks include: 

            CA-99-08 - Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in rpc.cmsd

            http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-99-08-cmsd.html

            CA-99-05 - Vulnerability in statd exposes vulnerability in automountd

            http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-99-05-statd-automountd.html

            CA-98.11 - Vulnerability in ToolTalk RPC Service

            http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-98.11.tooltalk.html

       Description

       Recent reports involving these vulnerabilities have involved very similar intruder activity. The level of activity and the scope of the incidents suggests that intruders
       are using scripts to automate attacks. These attacks appear to attempt multiple exploitations but produce similar results. We have received reports of the
       following types of activity associated with these attacks: 

            Core files for rpc.ttdbserverd located in the root "/" directory, left by an exploitation attempt against rpc.ttdbserverd

            Files named callog.* located in the cmsd spool directory, left by an exploitation attempt against rpc.cmsd

            Exploitations that execute similar commands to create a privileged back door into a compromised host. Typically, a second instance of the inetd daemon
            is started using an intruder-supplied configuration file. The configuration file commonly contains an entry that provides the intruder a privileged back door
            into the compromised host. The most common example we have seen looks like this: 

                  /bin/sh -c echo 'ingreslock stream tcp wait root /bin/sh -i' >> /tmp/bob;/usr/sbin/inetd -s /tmp/bob
                

            If successfully installed and executed, this back door may be used by an intruder to gain privileged (e.g., root) access to a compromised host by
            connecting to the port associated with the ingreslock service, which is typically TCP port 1524. The file names and service names are arbitrary; they may
            be changed to create an inetd configuration file in a different location or a back door on a different port.

            In many cases, scripts have been used to automate intruder exploitation of back doors installed on compromised hosts. This method has been used to
            install and execute various intruder tools and tool archives, initiate attacks on other hosts, and collect output from intruder tools such as packet sniffers. 

            One common set of intruder tools we have seen is included in an archive file called neet.tar, which includes several intruder tools:

                 A packet sniffer named update or update.hme that produces an output file named output or output.hme

                 A back door program named doc that is installed as a replacement to /usr/sbin/inetd. The back door is activated when a connection is received
                 from a particular source port and a special string is provided. We have seen the source port of 53982 commonly used.

                 A replacement ps program to hide intruder processes. We have seen a configuration file installed at /tmp/ps_data on compromised hosts.

            Another common set of intruder tools we have seen is included in an archive file called leaf.tar, which includes serveral intruder tools:

                 A replacement in.fingerd program with a back door for intruder access to the compromised host

                 eggdrop, an IRC tool commonly installed on compromised hosts by intruders. In this activity, we've seen the binary installed as /usr/sbin/nfds

                 Various files and scripts associated with eggdrop, many of which are installed in the directory /usr/lib/rel.so.1

                 A replacement root crontab entry used to start eggdrop 

            It is possible that other tools and tool archives could be involved in similar activity. 

            In some cases, we have seen intruder scripts remove or destroy system binaries and configuration files. 

       Solutions

       If you believe a host has been compromised, we encourage you to disconnect the host from the network and review our steps for recovering from a root
       compromise: 

            http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/root_compromise.html 

       In many cases intruders have installed packet sniffers on compromised hosts and have used scripts to automate collection of the output logs. It may be the case
       that usernames and passwords used in network transactions with a compromised host, or on the same network segment as a compromised host, may have
       fallen into intruder hands and are no longer secure. We encourage you to address password security issues after any compromised hosts at your site have been
       secured. 

       You should also review the state of security on other hosts on your network. If usernames and passwords have been compromised, an intruder may be able to
       gain unauthorized access to other hosts on your network. Also, an intruder may be able to use trust relationships between hosts to gain unauthorized access
       from a compromised host. Our intruder detection checklist can help you to evaluate a host's state of security: 

            http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/intruder_detection_checklist.html 

       We encourage you to ensure that your hosts are current with security patches or work-arounds for well-known vulnerabilities. In particular, you may wish to review
       the following CERT advisories for suggested solutions:

      Humour in UNIX Man Pages

      Here are some excerpts from UNIX (specifically solaris 2.5, but also some other OSes
     and some freeware packages) manpages and headerfiles. Probably a bit esoteric, so if you

     10 Answers when asked about a bug

     - I don't think that this is really a bug 
     - It would be too hard to implement right 
     - Fixing this would need a change in the documentation 
     - It wouldn't work right anyway 
     - This bug is too hard to track down 
     - This bug doesn't really interfere with normal use of the program 
     - Well, how do you think it should work? 
     - Why not fix it later? 
     - No program can be absolutely bug-free 
     - We'll fix that on the next major redesign

     The Computer Contradictionary,  Stan Kelly-Bootle

     Review written by Robert M. Slade. 

     The only two computer dictionaries worth having are both from MIT Press: 
     "The New Hacker's Dictionary" (cf. BKNHACKD.RVW), and this one. As news is
     something that someone, somewhere, wants hushed up, so the only computer terms
     of any importance are those that someone, somewhere, just made up. Everything
     else is the perverted verbiage of a marketing department. 

     Where "Hacker's" (or TNHD) studies and stores the language of the anarchic technical
     crowd, the Contradictionary deals with the jargon of those who work in DP,T, and 
     IS--those who truly understand MISmanagement. It is not intended to be a reference 
     work--Kelly-Bootle notes that the reader should determine the meaning of a word *before*
     looking it up in this book--but a work of humour. Like all the best humour, of course, 
     it has strong points to make.

      HACK.gr SERVER PROFILE
                           

      What is HACK.gr

      HACK.gr is a greek Web Server, focusing its interest in security of
      computer systems and networks. It is working experimentally since
      November 1997 and is still (!) in pilot phase.

      Who owns HACK.gr

      The hack.gr domain and web server are owned and administered by Aris
      Koxaras, Helias Fotopoulos and Costas Christoyannis. They are all
      students of the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, in
      the Engineering School of the University of Patras and are working as
      Unix system administrators in the Department.

      Why HACK.gr - What hacker means

      The term hacker, in computer terminology, is used for those who have
      a deeper knowledge of the details of programmable systems. Jargon
      Dictionary uses the following meanings:

              - One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who
                enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about
                programming 
              - A person who is good at programming quickly 
                An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does
                work using it or on it 

      However, mainly due to the mass media, a negative meaning of the
      word hacker is used to describe one who makes bad use of his
      knowledge in order either to obtain access to anauthorised information
      or to cause damage. Jargon Dictionary notes:

              - [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive
                information by poking around. The correct term for this sense is
                cracker.

      This use of the word by mass media, for cases of software piracy,
      violation of intellectual rights, publishing of pornographic material and
      cause of damages in computer systems is totally incorrect.

      Content of HACK.gr

      HACK.gr offers already an online magazine (HACK.gr Gazette), hosts
      the web page of the Black Hole column of the .net magazine and news
      from the greek demo scene. It offers a meta search engine for the
      Greek cyberspace (MSE) and is working on mirroring of foreign web
      sites, indices of documents and web pages for easy access to
      information, fora creation etc. HACK.gr hosts pages of independent
      sources, whose content is managed by specific rules, but does not
      agree necessarily with the official thesis of HACK.gr.

      Access to HACK.gr

      HACK.gr does not offer shell access to people other than its
      administrators. It only offers the capability of uploading web pages and
      e-mail aliases to users, whose pages are hosted in the site. The
      computer used is a Pentium with Linux Operating System, Apache Web
      Server and QMail e-mail server. Network access is offered by Groovy
      Net.

      Friends and ennemies

      HACK.gr was accepted with positive comments by system
      administrators, journalists and many netsurfers. Long time before the
      transition from the initial idea to its realisation, HACK.gr owners were
      "urged" by big Internet Providers to come at hosting agreement. Server
      hits turned out to be far more than expected, being more than 100,000
      per month, though the server is still in pilot/experimental function.
      However, some people are trying to "hush" HACK.gr and obscure its
      image, attempting to charge it with cause of problems. Having perfect
      cooperation with the involved Internet Providers, HACK.gr has
      repeatingly shown responsible attitude and proved that it has nothing
      to do with those intrigues. HACK.gr has helped various sites in security
      matters and cooparated in various cases with "competitors", such as
      the Next Crawler meta search engine.
