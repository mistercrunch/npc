   "stoners make the best cryptologists, I know because i've written some
   kick ass shit and the next day, no way could I figure out wtf I did
   man I have stuff from like the 80's that to this day, I still have no
   idea what it is and whole teams at the NSA have worked on it for me
   stoners man, thats how to do real strong crypto...DES? no! LSD? yes!"

   Synopsis
   --------     
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

    "For a company to delay a shipment for a month just means they are 
     doing the product quality work. If it is put off six months then they 
     probably have a problem." 

      -- Giga Information Group analyst Merv Adrian to Computer Reseller 
         News, comparing the one-month delay of Oracle's 8i database to the
         delays of Windows 2000 Server.

    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t)
    
    Send all goodies to:

    Dying to send something but want some recompense or don't know what
    to mail? well everyone who mails something in will be mentioned in a
    issue (man does this sound like a fucking DC/Marvel comic book or 
    what?) you won't get a secret decoder ring in return but you *will*
    get a 'secret' url that will have a 'present' for you (and only you)
    to show our appreciation (wanna know what it is? you'll have to send
    something to find out, and yeah picture postcards also count).
    
    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:
    
    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

    a cracker, ran a warez board (and a PD board) done some phone phun

    hat" (but it has little grey specks on it I must admit) and I am in
    no way a "master hacker/phreaker" not "leet". I'm just me, take it or
    leave it, didn't want it, didn't need it, been there, done that ...

0.4  Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.
     
     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article later in this issue) this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you up
     and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost like
     buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

      I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome on board some new *ppl

     correspondants to the zine. These people may not contribute to each 
     and every issue but they will be keeping us appraised of goings on
     within their geographic areas welcome aboard ppl!

     and other intros are to be found in section 2.7

    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.
      
    !=   - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
           ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
           an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
           to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint 
           fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)      
    AAM  - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)
   *AOL  - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
           clueless isp with seckurity that you can drive buses through, we're
           not talking Kung-Fu being no good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe?
    EoC  - End of Commentary
    EoA  - End of Article 
    EoF  - End of file
    EoD  - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)
    CC   - Credit Card phraud
    CCC  - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)
    NFC  - Depends on context: No Further Comment or No Fucking Comment

    PHAC - And variations of same &lt;coff> 
           Phreaking, Hacking, Anarchy, Cracking, Carding (CC) Groups Virus, Warfare
          
          Alternates: H - hacking, hacktivist
                      C - Cracking &lt;software>
                      C - Cracking &lt;systems hacking>

     +++ sorry its late, information overload.
     
     +++ We could use some feedback. Our current complaint tends to be 
         "give us more" in fact issue #5 is in progress already. I've decided
         that since some articles have a limited life-span on the net to 
         include them within the text rather than to  provide just links. I
         archive these articles for my own use anyway but indexing them in a
         database for future retrieval would be quite the task. I'd like to be
         able to publish weekly but at this time that seems somewhat unfeasible
         if the recent activity is any indication of the future.  Any input, 
         ideas, or comments are welcomed. More help in sorting out some of the 
         mass of stories may be needed after all... -Ed

     +++ Jan 9th: 13 yr old Chinese cracker arrested by Police: 
         From Bikkel Contributed to Bikkel by Deepcase
     
         A kid from Inner Mongalia was busted after he illegally accessed an
         information service network using his father's name. The teen-ager 
         connected to an information network and set up a page called 'Hacker.
         He also took control of some managers' accounts of a multimedia 
         telecommunications system. Because of his age the authorities couldn't
         prosecute him. (they didn't kill him??) Instead they ordered his 
         parents to keep a closer eye on him. This story is picked up by 
         The NewYork Times.
     
     +++ The Furby is reportedly banned from the NSA building due to it's

     Creation of HERT
     HERT - January 10th 1999, 09:12 EST
     
     HERT stands for Hacker Emergency Response Team and is an international
     non-profit organization based in France.
     
     Exactly like CERT, our US counterpart, our first goal is to provide
     accurate information about computer security vulnerabilities, provide
     incident response services to sites that have been the victims of attacks,
     publish security alerts and find new vulnerabilities. Our next goal is to
     represent concerned computer users and organizations as an advocacy
     league.
     
     Why HERT is a better alternative to CERT?
     
     National Computer Security Center, a sub-branch of the National Security
     Agency initiated the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team and
     was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA).
     
     A majority of people think CERT is doing a brilliant job, but when you
     examine CERT more closely, one could believe CERT is a bit corrupted.
     
     Just take a look at the CERT statistics, since 1995, for 1027
     vulnerabilities reported, they have published only 55 advisories
     bulletins. Is this a joke, did they count duplicate vulnerability reports?
     Was there 1000 cert initiated vendor advisories?
     
     >From an organization directed by US Military Intelligence, you must
     assume the worst especially when they brag about their Information
     Superiority.
     
     We decided to create HERT, when system administrators of highly sensitive
     US networks informed us that they were supplied with official vendor
     patches months before public announcement were made by vendors, CERT or
     full-disclosure mailing lists like Bugtraq.

2.3  Crypto: Cypherpunks list announcements
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     X-Authentication-Warning: toad.com: Host localhost [127.0.0.1] didn't use HELO protocol
     To: cypherpunks-announce@toad.com, cryptography@c2.net, gnu@toad.com
     Subject: Watch the gov't discuss crypto policy Friday in Cupertino: PECSENC
     Date: Wed, 13 Jan 1999 02:21:45 -0800
     From: John Gilmore &lt;gnu@toad.com>
     
     PECSENC is a hard-to-parse acronym for the President's Export Council,
     Subcommittee on Encryption.  The Council is a group of assorted
     citizens appointed by the President of the US under Executive Order
     12991 to advise him on US trade issues.  Since crypto policy is so
     complex and painful, they pushed it into a subcommittee of its own.
     That subcommittee is meeting this Friday at HP in Cupertino.  They
     usually meet on the East Coast, far from most people affected by the
     crypto regulations, so I thought it would be friendly of us to show up
     and welcome them to Silicon Valley.
     
     I will be speaking at the meeting about the Wassenaar Arrangement, but
     that isn't why you should come.  You should come because this is one
     of the few public fora in which government and selected citizens
     actually discuss crypto policy.  Officially, and to advise the President.
     
     They faxed me 6 pages of maps and directions, but it all boils down
     to: Take I-280 to Cupertino, exit on Wolfe Road going north/east, turn
     right at the second light on Pruneridge Ave, turn left at the first
     light into the HP complex, go 200 feet and turn right at the "T"
     intersection, and follow to the last building on the left, Building
     46.  Park in the visitor lot in front, register at the reception desk
     and get a badge.  The room can hold about 60 people (of which about 30
     will be PECSENC and invited speakers.)
     
     There won't be an opportunity to rant, like there was a few years ago
     when the National Research Council invited public comments at the CFP
     conference.  (Perhaps they'll set one up for a future meeting -- I
     think it would be informative for them.)  But it's a chance to see the
     alice-in-wonderland workings of the government as they try to
     manipulate a supposedly independent advisory group into overlooking
     the emperor's nudity.  We may get a chance to make a few short, polite
     comments, though they've arranged the agenda so the public gets to
     comment *before* the government or the subcommittee says anything
     worth commenting about.
     
     Some of the people on the subcommittee should be well known to 
     cypherpunks:
     
     	Stewart Baker, lawyer, ex-General Counsel of NSA, GAK cheerleader
     	Kevin McCurley, cryptographer, IBM Research, President of IACR
     		(IACR was established by Diffie, Chaum, Rivest, etc in the
     		 '70s to protect and foster crypto research -- www.iacr.org)
     	Esther Dyson, business philosopher & author, EFF, ICANN Interim Chair
     	John Liebman, lawyer, author of major export control law tome
     	  (I'm leaving out ten or twenty people, mostly because the list
     	   isn't published anywhere online that I can find)
     
     As part of their role in "supporting" the subcommittee's work, the
     government has published the driest and least fun-looking "Notice of
     Open Meeting" that the law will let them get away with:
     	http://www.bxa.doc.gov/tacs/PECSENCMtg.html
     However there is a juicier agenda which I received as a speaker:
     
       We have revised the schedule in light of certain timing constraints.  So,
       please note that the private sector discussion of Wassenaar will take
       place in the afternoon.  In addition to John Gilmore, PECSENC member Ira
       Rubenstein will address this topic.  (Lynn McNulty of RSA has been
       asked to offer remarks on RSA's experiences, too.)  Also, Whit Diffie will
       let us know shortly whether he will speak before the group.
     
       Here is the updated agenda:
     
       President's Export Council
       Subcommittee on Encryption
       January 15, 1998
       Pacific Ocean Room, Bldg. 46
       19447 Pruneridge Avenue
       Cupertino, California 95014
     
     9:00	Opening Comments/ 	Stewart Baker, Acting PECSENC Chairman
     	Discussion of List Server/
     	PECSENC's Role
     
     9:45	Public Comments
     
     10:00 	BXA Update	William A. Reinsch
     			Under Secretary for Export Administration
     
     10:30	Congressional Presentation	Representative Zoe Lofgren
     
     11:00	Briefings	The Wassenaar Arrangement and Ambassador Aaron's
      			Initiatives
     			James A. Lewis, Director
     			Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls
     			Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
     			Michelle O'Neill
     			Executive Director to Ambassador David Aaron
     			International Trade Administration (ITA)
     
     12:00	Lunch for Members
     
     1:15	Briefings	Private Sector Perspective on the Wassenaar Arrangement
     			John Gilmore, Co-Founder, EFF
     			Ira Rubenstein, Senior Corporate Attorney, Microsoft
     
     2:00			Foreign Availability of Encryption Technology
     			Kevin McCurley, Ph.D., IBM
     
     2:30			What's New In Commercial Crypto
     			Dr. Taher Elgamal, CEO, Securify, Inc.
     			Dr. John Atalla, Chairman, Tristrata, Inc.
     
     4:00			Adjourn
     
     I encourage anyone from the Bay Area crypto community who cares about
     export controls on crypto to come observe the meeting, and participate
     in the discussions in the hallways.  Like attending hearings of the
     Bernstein case, open your costume box and pull out the business drag
     (suits & whatever businesswomen enjoy wearing these days).  Our role
     will be less to inform the meeting of anything in particular, and more
     to inform them by our quiet presence that lots of significant people
     care to watch exactly what they're doing with our civil rights.
     
     After watching how it operates and thinking for a bit, you might have
     some informed suggestions for the subcommittee, which can be sent to
     them by email.  As Thomas Pynchon said, "If they can get you to ask
     the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answers."  The
     Commerce Dept may have been all too successful at getting the
     subcommittee to focus on the wrong questions.  (E.g. before the DES
     Cracker announcement, they were debating whether to ask the President
     to decontrol DES -- a useless and counterproductive action which of
     course the government has just done.)  Just as the cypherpunks came up
     with some great questions to inform the Clipper debate, I'm sure we
     can come up with some meaty questions for the subcommittee to chew on,
     rather than the pap the gov't feeds them.
     
     If you have any further questions about PECSENC or the meeting, please
     contact:

     I hope to see you-all there.

     PS:  Also, don't forget the cypherpunks meeting the following day, in
     rooms B1-B2 of the San Jose Convention Center, noon-6PM, Saturday 16Jan99.

     I often hear people saying things like, "Stupid fucking media, they don't
     know the meaning of the word hacker!", and "Cracker you whore, hackers are
     the good guys!" Well, I'm going to start writing, and we'll see what I come
     up with.
     
     -
     
     In this day and age, we rely upon those who dedicate their lives to
     distributing information among the masses. Our world would not be the way it
     is today, without our constant supply of news and entertainment. Yet,
     whenever they, the suppliers of this information, make a mistake, we launch
     into an almighty rage.
     One of the most common 'mistakes' made by the media, is the printing of
     hacker, instead of cracker. We, the hackers, love to flame and complain at
     the media for that mistake, yet I ask myself, why?
     Did you know, that there are hundreds of thousands of 'hackers' out there
     that would love to get their hands on us, the computer hackers? A long time
     ago, probably before many of you 'hackers' were born (including myself), the
     term hacker was used to describe someone who not craved information, but
     craved understanding. We weren't hackers of computer systems, we were
     hackers of the system. A system which can be anything that has some form of
     input, process and output. The body for example, it's a system of systems,
     including the nervous system, the digestive system and others. The solar
     system, it again consists of many systems. And so, you can be a (system-)
     hacker of anything from computers, to astronomy. So, as much as many of you
     may dislike it, the cracker is never the less, a hacker just as much as you
     or I. A cracker is a hacker of hacked knowledge. (Imagine this too, if your
     annoyed of being on the same plain as crackers, what must crackers, hackers
     of the cryptographic code, feel like!?)
     I really don't think it's very mature of us to consider the term hacker as
     solely ours, it's hard for the media to use the right terms, when in fact
     they are the wrong term. We don't give the media enough slack, how many
     times have any of you spoken to a reporter and tried to explain that there
     are differences between hackers that obtain knowledge, and hackers that
     exploit it!? How many people here have written texts to help a reporter
     and/or editor to understand what being a computer hacker means? I'm willing
     to bet, not many. Don't blame the media for something they can't understand,
     something that we, the computer hackers, wont even help teach them about.
     (Freedom of information my ass, you'd gladly help if you were true hackers!)
     
     -
     
     Hmm, I know, it could have been better, but in the twenty-odd minutes I
     spent writing it, I'm pleased. I'd love to hear some feedback, who agrees,
     who disagrees? And non of that shit trying to stop me from expressing my
     point of view, because I'll only look at you and see an exploiter of the
     hacker ethic.

4.1  "The Hacker; Sex symbol of the Millenium" 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     By Qubik 
     (c) 1999 Qubik/HWA    
    
     We all know that it's cool to be a hacker. The attention we get from the
     media and from our fellow associates is satisfying to say the least, but how
     many of us actually use this to our advantage? I take a shit, a shave and
     wash under my armpits and I'm ready to put my ability to the test..
     
     At a recent party I was able to experience first-hand how being a hacker can
     get the girls groping (literally) for your attention. In fact, you don't
     even need to be a hacker to take advantage of this great exploit of the
     opposite sex, you just need to be able to sound convincing and act cool.
     
     How does it work then, what do you have to do? Well, you don't really have
     to do anything, in fact it's best if you try not to do anything at all. It's
     as easy as one, two, three..
     
     First, your going to need to make sure you've got some non-hacker friends,
     that means breaking out of your standard routine of sitting in front of a PC
     all day with stacks of books on either side of you. You need to get out in
     the real world, now I know that a lot of the readers will already have
     real-world friends, so their already a third of the way there! Hell, you can
     even use your computer knowledge to help out a couple of the really 'cool'
     guys or gals at your school, college or uni, there's always someone who
     hasn't got a clue. Help them out, go on, even if it means talking slowly
     like a complete lamer and explaining things in layman terms. (I have faith
     in you, you can do it.) Now, get to knows these outsiders, start to spend
     some time with them and act like them. (Hey, you can hack during the
     weekdays, try relaxing at the weekends.)
     
     Now, you've got some real friends, sooner or later there's going to be a
     party. Get yourself invited, it'll be easier than you think, trust me. And
     there you have it, stage two completed, you've got cool friends and your
     going to a cool party, now lets start pulling the girls. (Or boys, if your a
     female reader.)
     
     Your at the party, now what do you do!? Sit back, relax and have a drink!
     People always fear that no one will talk to them, they will, especially if
     you act like your having a bad time! I use this tactic a lot, girls just
     can't help saying something. Sooner or later, someone will say that your
     good with computers, or that your a hacker, they'll naturally be interested
     and this'll be your key. Stage three, just wait and see. You could of
     course, if your more sure of yourself, go up to someone. (Not recommended
     for newbies. Heh.)
     
     And when the girls/boys come, talk some shit about how you hacked into a
     government server using a Sendmail exploit, or you know some a elite hacker
     who used the SSHD exploit to transfer $100,000 from one bank account to
     another!
     
     So just how successful is this exploit? Well, I'm your stereotypical old
     school hacker, with scruffy looks and too much on my mind, in one night,
     three girls got to grips (ahem) with my abilities.
     
     Just give it a go, from my experience hackers really turn the opposite (or
     even same, if your into that kind of thing) sex on. And if you don't trust
     me, think about this.. Don't other hackers turn you on!?

     optiklenz: is anyone logging?
     DigiEbola: yes
     dyslexia: yes
     lothos: yeah
     optiklenz: ok
     optiklenz: at anyrate
     DataShark: so am I.
     Big|Feet: same here
     NeatHack: log is on 
     [havoc]: shut the fuck up ppl
     LordPsY: yup
     blakcloud: go on 
     lothos: ssshhhhhh
     optiklenz: today the news reported that two crackers were
                being sentanced to death
     optiklenz: i'll wait for everyone to finish their conversation..
     NeatHack: sentanced to death ?? what press any link on
               that info ?
     DataShark: PUT to death.
     dethl0k: that
     DigiEbola: from what i saw, some guy mailed my ccmail at
                work, from cnn
     optiklenz: Well it's covered by HNN if you want to read an
                article about it cnn wrote something
     DataShark: I heard they were PUT to death.
     dethl0k: s cruel
     dethl0k: erm
     DigiEbola: for 31000 dollars at that.
     DigiEbola: china.
     LordPsY: ok
     optiklenz: What they did is wrong with out a doubt, but it was no more a
                crime than what our President committed by perjuring himself 
                before the grand jury of the United States of America.
     optiklenz: . It does not deserve the death penalty. The death penalty is
                something that should be heldFor only those who commit the 
                most gruesome crimes that of murder, child rape,
     optiklenz: and Being a Benedict Arnold
     DataShark: There is a VERY big differance between putting two ppl to 
                death and lying to some ppl.
     NeatHack: agree with optik
     optiklenz: China's actions has shown superficial, and
     damaging, and Iraq follows behind.
     optiklenz: Iraq has treated human rights issues as poorly as China has.
     DigiEbola: look at both of their goverments
     optiklenz: A nation made up of starving people While their leader rest in
                one of his 14 palaces taunting and parading his country men, 
                and above all Involving other countries in his sick escapades.
     dyslexia: chine is estimated to have murdered approx 100 million ppl 
               internally since the communists came to power
     optiklenz: . The Iraqi military has access to hydrogen bombs. What in the
                world do they need hydrogen bombs for?
     optiklenz: I don't think Something 2+ times the power of an atomic bomb 
               should be operated by anyone for whatever prospect.
     NeatHack: ok but what is our realtion with them and thier miss governed
               govrment ?
     optiklenz: i'm getting to that
     ShadoWalk: kan the man go on a dialog? please?
     DataShark: WMD. they whant other countrys to fear them. same as the US.
     NeatHack: koll
     [havoc]: human rights!
     optiklenz: We need to carry out what the government won't, and can't do.
     NeatHack: optiklenz I agree.. We need to carry out what the government 
               won't, and can't do.
     lothos: i agree optik
     DigiEbola: burn them.
     kInGbOnG: preach on brother optik
     optiklenz: The government has made threats over China's current human 
               rights standing. They're cutting trade deals or they have in
               the past.
     optiklenz: Is it good enough?
     DataShark: no.
     optiklenz: to put it simply.. no it's not
     DataShark: it is fucking sad
     NeatHack: no
     optiklenz: China doesn't give a fuck if we trade with them or not.
     NeatHack: right
     DataShark: erm..
     optiklenz: They dont but we sure do
     DigiEbola: thats the way we are.
     optiklenz: We get most of our imports from china in the first place. Look 
                at the tag of Your shirt or any one of your household appliances
                and tell me differently
     NeatHack: cuase is shipper to produce their and ship to here... 
     NeatHack: that is one point.
     LordPsY: sure its cheaper when children make ur shirts
     optiklenz: What is a threat with out some sort of whacked out maneuver to
               accommodate It, and bring intimidation The Chinese are all to 
               familiar with "intimidation"
     ShadoWalk: ok optik.. so what are we going to do about it?
     lothos: optik
     lothos: my shirt was made in mexico
     lothos: heh
     optiklenz: The Chinese kill people when they want their point heard and
               when it Comes down to it we all ultimately do that with out as 
               much as the pull Of a trigger or the push of a button. The U.S 
               cant say they've dealt a Fair hand either
     optiklenz: There are enough problems in Washington as it is now.
     zortin8r: shit
     zortin8r: the meeting star?
     DigiEbola: not to jump ahead, but can anyone be extrodited for screwing
               with them?
     optiklenz: When half the government officials perform on a pants down 
               agenda
     dyslexia: wit the trial of the person who is accused of trying to start a 
               democratic party
     dyslexia: Digi, there is no extradition agreement between the US and china
               for computer crime
     optiklenz: some action has to be taken by an outside group
     NeatHack: outside group? like
     optiklenz: not the FBI, the NSA (donut shortage? Not on your life)
     optiklenz: and no not the fucken A Team
     optiklenz: I'm sure they know who we are.
     DigiEbola: well, if we are so hip to trade with them, they could pressure.
     optiklenz: and if some compliance is not met I'm sure they'll know on a 
                first hand basis. I know what some of you are thinking at the
                moment "has optik gone mad?! is optik on  another one of his week
                long drinking spree's?!" Answer: "No"
     DataShark: well (playing the devils advocate) what GOOD can come of some
                intravention buy a group already involved.. what about getting
                some other ppl involved.. maybe the l0pht or HDF..
     optiklenz: other people have been involved
     zortin8r: someone bring me up-to-date what are we talking about?
     optiklenz: look at the cdc, and the hongkong blondes..
     optiklenz: zort you know the routine
     optiklenz: pick up a log on your way out
     zortin8r: k..
     DataShark: the cDc no offence will not get involved.. (will they)?
     bronc_: cDc + HKB = 0
     DataShark: thats what I figured.
     optiklenz: At anyrate I'm damn serious if we don't act against our nations
               rights policies, and the nations of others we may not have the 
               right to do so as time progresses. Many years ago our Countries
               four fathers wrote, "Governments are instituted among Men, Deriving
               their powers from the consent of the governed; That whenever any 
               Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the 
               "Right of The "People" to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
               new Gove
     DataShark: werd.. (no offense:) )
     optiklenz: THEY GOVERN WHAT WE PUT IN OUR MOUTHS!
     optiklenz: ! DAMMIT LETS NOT LET THEM DO THE SAME TO WHAT COMES OUT OF
               OUR MOUTHS!
     DataShark: optiklenz: are you saying we should act agenst the US govnt?
     DFalcon: hey bola
     DigiEbola: i do not like the fact that somewhere in this world, someone can
               be put to death for something we do freely.
     LordPsY: he
     optiklenz: I bring up Popular Sovereignty this Is the basis that government
               can exist and function only with the consent Of the governed (well
               guess what. That's us). It is the people who holdpower it is the 
               people who are sovereign!
     DataShark: I agree with lerfty.
     optiklenz: Data> and if we do nothing it makes things better?
     DigiEbola: it is about power, and who can wield it.
     DataShark: I did not say that.
     ShadoWalk: optiklenz:.. so we act against who? 
     DataShark: I cannot as a person sit idly by and watch someone be persicuted 
               for somthing that in reality IS NOT A CRIME
     ShadoWalk: or whom
     optiklenz: It is certainly seem'd like what you were  insinuating
     DigiEbola: we as a country are not going to shake up china, because we want
               their shit
     optiklenz: it rather
     NeatHack: optiklenz you know I done the war in lebanon and I saw political
               people going up and going down... I know in my opinion when $$$ 
               come to play it is hard to  stand but you can stand with nice 
               understanding .... I lived the situation for year POLICATAL WAR 
               AND REAL WAR ...
     optiklenz: I'm very aware of that
     zortin8r: 8
     zortin8r: ack
     NeatHack: when u can stop the $$$ game you win 
     DataShark: so what can we do? do we openly protest? do
     we *laff* write our congressmen?
     DigiEbola: and that does what?
     DigiEbola: show me a straight congressman
     [havoc]: true.
     DigiEbola: ill take you to hell to ice skate.
     NeatHack: ture 
     DataShark: heh
     ShadoWalk: i think i know where he's goin with this.. i'm just waitin to
                see if i'm right
     [havoc]: mass hack.
     optiklenz: I say this to you LoU members.It is our right our duty, and our
               justice to pull through with a strike against Iraqi data systems 
               to do so we not only aid the people of those countries, but we 
               bring light to the subject at hand to nations everywhere. So I
               ask you this if you are with me then we must act now, and we must
               act fierce. We develop the hardware, and software they Utilize. We
               code the security tools that they use we can just as easily
               disassemble
     DigiEbola: name the target.
     blakcloud: i cant say much about this cuz im not inthe states but personally
                i dont think it is right what is going on over there and that it 
                should stop... i dunno...
     ShadoWalk: he said it
     optiklenz: They've been fucking shit up for years well guess what? It's our 
                turn.
     DataShark: WERD!
     ShadoWalk: optik.. lemme get a modem and i'm in
     NeatHack with you optik
     [havoc]: damn straight.
     DataShark: optiklenz: lets kick some ass.
     dyslexia: ppl, the bottom line issue is human rights, that is something we
               all must fight for
     optiklenz: One serve deserves another, and I plan on playing to win. If one
               official looks at things, and thinks to himself what he stands for
               is wrong, and things do need to change then we not only dominate 
               the war, but we've already won the war. Even if things stay the 
               same if we could bring the awareness to people who are otherwise
               dense in cameraperson with their actions then we're that much closer
     kInGbOnG: wh00p!
     DigiEbola: we have fought for it in that past.
     optiklenz: Yeah but we are giving it a new twist
     optiklenz: our idea of war is blowing shit up
     NeatHack: optik what about our gov how they will act toward this ???
     optiklenz: nothing good ever came out of killing someone
     NeatHack: talking canada and US giv
     [havoc]: information warfare!
     optiklenz: we have nothing to do with the u.s government
     ShadoWalk: so we take down iraq's databases
     optiklenz: thats the plan
     LordPsY: hmmm
     _defiant: haxor iraqxor?
     NeatHack: I know ... but when u do stuff to iraq they will take it as US
              attacking iraq 
     DigiEbola: rm / -Rf and dont look back?
     LordPsY: Thats a big thing
     optiklenz: We have the right, and power not to kill, but to speak out, and
              with our actions cripple an otherwise already broken enconomy. With
              the trigger they use to kill innocent people I use the same trigger
              to shut them down, and not only denounce one man, but the entire 
              communist government of china, and fascist rule of Iraq.
     ShadoWalk: and therefor erase all their amassed knowladge of biochemical
              warfare.. and deliver a message at the sdame time
     dyslexia: optik, you have considered that if we become pain enuff to iraq or
              china, they may choose direct intervention with ourselves as the 
              targets
     lothos: iraq == .iq i think
     DigiEbola: yah
     DigiEbola: they are not beyond hitmen.
     optiklenz: Dyslexia> yes
     dyslexia: beyond, that is their only recourse
     NeatHack: ok optik imagine we are able to shut all IRAQ system what will affect
              the ECOnomy ,, ?? or the political  GAmE ... or the Shit War ??
     rootbot: [sreality] rootbot! rootbot! gimme sum! gimme sum, sh1zz!
     DataShark: erm.
     NeatHack: how the damage will affect them ?
     DigiEbola: how good can a iraqi admin be?
     optiklenz: haha
     optiklenz: Thats what Im saying
     ShadoWalk: bet i could take him..heh
     [havoc]: so optik
     optiklenz: We need to make it clear that killing people (innocent lives) is
                not the only resolve.
     DataShark: keep in mind we HAVE troops over there (the US) I have friends 
               there.lets walk lightly and carry and BIG FUCKING STICK if we do
               this.
     [havoc]: the plan for an attack.
     spacerog: Are you going to operate under the LoU name or form a new group?
     dyslexia: Digi, most of the arab countries and israel have much experience
              at dealing with hostile attacks, both politacally, physical and 
              data wise
     DigiEbola: their systems are reputably old
     optiklenz: Data> that's the plan
     [havoc]: should we hop over to europe somewhere and launch ? or from within
             the us
     datapleX: lothos!
     datapleX: bah
     DigiEbola: dys
     datapleX: oh
     DigiEbola: true
     ShadoWalk: so optik.. are we going to wait until this rash thing is over?
     NeatHack: Well guy I think you are missing the TARGET here... buy shutting 
              couple of server of ALL the net in iraq they will not understand I
              think ?
     DigiEbola: they use propoganda like wild fire
     XeXeN: yes
     ShadoWalk: so as not to piss off all the other muslim nations?
     NeatHack: U must affact them at ecomiy level
     NeatHack: or political level
     dyslexia: neathack, the unfortunate reality of economic sanctions etc are
              lost on the leaders, they dont suffer, only the people do
     DigiEbola: it would be nice if we had loyal iraqi hackers
     DigiEbola: working for us
     ShadoWalk: i saw we take out every military database we kan find.. rm / -rf
               it 
     NeatHack: that is true dysl
     NeatHack: then how to affect them ?
     lothos: spacerogue brings up a good point
     lothos: do we do this as LoU or what?
     dyslexia: bring them to the attention of the world, simply as otik says
     bronc_: sheesh..
     NeatHack: that is an idea that can affect the, u see.
     .ShadoWalk> i saw we take out every military database we kan find.. rm / 
      -rf it 
     dyslexia: optik at least
     Big|Feet: hrm.. on the defcon mailing list a while back someone brought up
             the idea "why not attack their systems" and it was argued that they
             don't have much connection to the net (if any) so what systems are
             you attacking?
     DataShark: what is iraqi's top level?
     DigiEbola: well, you know nobody likes a smart ass, and as soon as one of 
              us walks thru one of their servers and posts, they are going to be
              PISSED.
     lothos: .iq i believe
     dyslexia: heh, they will have links allright, but the majority will be
              through sympathetic arab countries in the case of iraq
     _defiant: SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHATS GOING ON
     _defiant: heh
     DigiEbola: defiant
     DigiEbola: we are going to war.
     ShadoWalk: shyt
     DigiEbola: heh.
     DataShark: DO we do this as LoU or what?
     LordPsY: hehe
     DataShark: DO we do this as LoU or what?
     LordPsY: ah hes back
     DigiEbola: i want china.
     optiklenz: no
     optiklenz: we dont do this as anyone
     LordPsY: so
     DataShark: anonymous?
     optiklenz: no names will be left no handles or affiliations
     optiklenz: the chinese embassy has us under investigation
     DataShark: what a supprise.
     ShadoWalk: whooooooohooooooo
     datapleX: heh
     ShadoWalk: lets get rowdy
     _defiant: werd
     [havoc]: information warfare at its best.
     _defiant: heh
     NeatHack: _defiant :the Big image is :optik come up with the idea to 
             attack iraq and china since they are soing shit with them 
             population....
     datapleX: uhm...that is really messin' w/ some shit
     _defiant: NeatHack: didn't everyone say that before heh
     DigiEbola: oh great
     dyslexia: ppl, action against governments who ignore the rights of and
             pretty much enslave their ppl is good in my book, buts it's not
             just limited to iraq and china
     NeatHack: and we kind agreed what we are trying to figure out what damage
             can be cuased ...
     DigiEbola: some ninja fucker is going to hunt us all down
     ShadoWalk: 6.4 gigz of kiq azz
     datapleX: heh
     optiklenz: one thing I want everyone to know is that we only operate if we
              can do so without risk
     _defiant: ok, lets talk about something in a public chan, then try and be
             anonomous
     _defiant: makes sense
     optiklenz: as i said i have no problem working with a client on his network
              while blasting on chinese communist
     NeatHack: make sence...
     DigiEbola: defiant, nothing on irc is anonymous
     _defiant: Digi: i was pointing out the irony in it
     DigiEbola: _defiant: yes yes
     dyslexia: heh, indeed digi, that is true
     optiklenz: but I would not want to indulge any member into something that
              would end up ruining his/her life
     zortin8r: its not like irc is encrypted or anthing..
     DataShark: HAHA
     optiklenz: If we attack Chinese systems the attacks need to originate from
               china. Same goes for Iraqi networks.
     DigiEbola: well, efnet has services specially for the purpose of watching
     optiklenz: heh
     ShadoWalk: optiklenz: i may be a bit lame.. but i learn hella quik and i'll
               do it reguardless of consequences
     NeatHack: and how u do so originate the attack from china??
     zortin8r: has anyone here _ever_ encountered and Iraqi
     network? cause i have never seen one before..
     NeatHack: u mean physicaly in china ?
     optiklenz: do the damage from a chinese network
     spacerog: I assume that HNN was mailed because you wanted this publiciced,
              yes?
     Big|Feet: [optiklenz]: i never even knew iraq had access to
     the net.. what systems to you plan go nailing so to speak
     optiklenz: spacerog it's your call
     optiklenz: Big> iraqi has networks
     DigiEbola: everyone has networks
     optiklenz: just because a majority are internal does not mean they are
               sasfe
     d4hp: herm ...
     optiklenz: safe rather
     Big|Feet: yes
     DataShark: optiklenz: do we REALLY want alot of attention draw to this 
               before we do some damage?
     zortin8r: i think me and BigFeet are feeling the same thing here.. where 
              the hell are the iraqi networks?
     spacerog: opti: cool
     Big|Feet: like i was saying before
     _defiant hides and had nothing to do with it ;)
     dyslexia: optik, for access to iraq we will likely need to look in
              sympathetic arab nations
     Big|Feet: the public is not allowed access to the internet in iraq
     DigiEbola: Big|Feet: not so
     optiklenz: yeah
     DigiEbola: Big|Feet: there are a few
     blakcloud: very few
     optiklenz: whatever we can do to keep sadaam from going on the net for his
               daily dose of kiddy porn
     DigiEbola: matter of fact
     Big|Feet: probly.. but censored
     DigiEbola: during the bombings, there was some on
     datapleX: heh
     NeatHack agree with that optik
     NeatHack: roflllll daily dose of kiddy porn
     Big|Feet: hrm.. saddam's pron stash
     DataShark: haha
     DigiEbola: hmm, ya know, if we upload a shitload of kiddie
     pr0n to his servers
     datapleX: hahaha
     dyslexia: thats whta they are hiding from the arms
     inspectors, lol
     zortin8r: haha
     DataShark: ok..
     DigiEbola: i guess the government will have to arrest him
     ShadoWalk: heh
     _defiant: optik: i agree with it all again, but like, i don't
     want to get arrested again
     DigiEbola: yah, my new years resolution is that i dont have to mess with
              any kind of law enforcement this year
     [havoc]: cover your ass and the chances of you getting caught are reduced.
     optiklenz: If they want to fight we stand steadfast with what we believe in,
              and are ready To strap on our armor and take defense. LoU was 
              established over 7 years ago As a research team, and we also called
              ourselves mercenaries. "We are ready to Commence, and take partition
              in electronic warfare if ever requested . The attack will go on for 
              one Week. The time will be extended if needed . If anyone disagrees 
              on the actions We are about to take let me know why. I
     DigiEbola: you hit a server, you better root it
     _defiant: havoc: i was arrested for something i never did before, make no sense
     optiklenz: hshs
     optiklenz: def> yeah that happens a lot around here
     _defiant: optiklenz: i'm still down with it as long as we cause no wars etc
     DigiEbola: lets tear them a new electronic asshole.
     optiklenz: it's common to hair "what network? computer? huh whats that?"
              over here at the office
     optiklenz: s/hair/hear
     sreality: #1.. I doubt iraq actually has military databases
     optiklenz: geez maybe i am drunk and just dont know it yet
     [havoc]: :)
     Big|Feet: they have to have something
     zortin8r: if iraq does have military databases and networks, how do we go 
              about finding them?
     _defiant: DataShark: hah, no, they were serious about it
     DigiEbola: if it wears a turban, and crawls in sand, root it.
     sreality: well
     _defiant: it was like
     _defiant: YOUR UDNER ARREST
     sreality: best thing to start with
     _defiant: heh
     DataShark: ohhh I have one question.. can some teach me howto hack? Im 
              running into truble when it says to press the any key...
     sreality: is the iraq tld
     sreality: scan the shizz outa that
     _defiant: and some police woman was frisking me
     optiklenz: this is just recreation
     optiklenz: heh
     sreality: then hand probe the boxes
     sreality: there cant be many
     DigiEbola: DataShark: i removed the any key long time ago....
     DataShark: DAMNIT lerfty.
     headflux is idle, automatically dead [bX(l/on p/off)]
     optiklenz: never once have they sent a chick down here
     optiklenz: basterds.
     sreality: then goto any nations that surround iraq
     Big|Feet: what any any chinese governet buildings in the us i bet they
              have some info
     DataShark: optiklenz: haha
     _defiant: optiklenz: yeah, ccu guy and 2 chicks
     Big|Feet: or iraq or that matter
     sreality: hey.
     sreality: umm you forgot something
     d4hp: tee hee
     sreality: the iraq databases are gonna be in their language
     sreality: and umm
     DataShark: sreality: HAHAH oops..
     sreality: none of use has charater support for that
     optiklenz: sreality> thats what altavista translator's for
     optiklenz: heh
     sreality: so how are we gonna know what that is
     Big|Feet: altavista
     d4hp: yeh ..
     Big|Feet: hehehe
     ShadoWalk: oh yea.. i learn hella quik

              languages
     ShadoWalk: ok zort..heh
     _defiant: zortin8r: YOU TELL HIM HEH
     NeatHack: sreality> so how are we gonna know what that
     is NO PROBLEM 
     datapleX: uhm...me to. I would like to try to get into LoU at
     this time to.
     sreality: becuz those languages are like

     DigiEbola: optiklenz: how would you like this done? hunting
              parties or completely independent?
     spacerog: Any objections with using the LoU name in a
             story for HNN? If I say "A bunch of hackers declared
             war..." no one will listen.
     DataShark: anyone speek raganise?

     sreality: its a semi good idea
     d4hp: boooo!
     sreality: but it has some faults
     DigiEbola: so thats 2 ppl, and a shitload of terminals
     blakcloud: hehe
     DFalcon: what ya guys talking about ?
     t3q: datapleX: w3rd.
     sreality: #1.. we need FIRST OFF some iraqie translators
     DigiEbola: we also have osu here, so we can work anonymously 
     datapleX: werd
     sreality: #2.. we need to probe the shit outa all middle-eastern
             countries
     NeatHack: DAM read what I said sreality> #1.. we need FIRST OFF some
             iraqie translators
     DigiEbola: i want lists
     optiklenz: ok well
     [havoc]: if we are going to do this with a serious mind, we need to
        gather together and find specific targets, and take them out.. in a
        team effort.
     *zortin8r* wow.
     optiklenz: I'll be going through possible targets
     DigiEbola: if its buried in the sand, i will set up a mail
     somewhere for it to be sent to
     sreality: NeatHack: so like what, your gonna translate it all,
     lebanon is partially french speaking too
     [havoc]: this ballz out attack wont work without a plan.
     LordPsY: #3 We should get some more infos bout the Iraqi networks
     NeatHack: sreality don;lt worry I will handle this part
     bronc_: so we are going at attack Iraqi networks?
     NeatHack: translation is ON ME>..
     optiklenz: havoc> yeah this was just to see if we should go
              through with something
     DataShark: NeatHack: ok.. you deal with the translater and
              the char set..
     optiklenz: I'm not playing cat and mouse here so if we go in
              we go in prepared without risk
     ShadoWalk: i'm following dtatplex
     optiklenz: or we all go back to our jobs and coding
     sreality: grr
     DigiEbola: all i know is, one character i understand of the
              iraqi alphabet is #
     Big|Feet: i should would like to see the whole plan .. should
             be beautiful
     NeatHack: I cna have window in arabic linux I do not know ?? 
     dethl0k: jobs and coding ;p
     sreality: its not safe to rely on ONE person
     DigiEbola: if i see a #, its all good.
     [havoc]: we need to make a key'd channel just for this
     purpose. so we can concentrate on the attacks.
     dethl0k: j/k
     sreality: we need two
     sreality: what if theres alot of shit to translate
     spacerog: Any plans to cordinate with the Hong kong
     Blondes? They are supposed to still be in operation.
     d4hp: tee hee

      Jan 9th 12:00 GMT a global hackers coalition released this joint
     press release:
     
     ***//
  
     LoU STRIKE OUT WITH INTERNATIONAL COALITION OF HACKERS: 

     A JOINT STATEMENT BY 2600, THE CHAOS COMPUTER
     CLUB, THE CULT OF THE DEAD COW, !HISPAHACK, L0PHT
     HEAVY INDUSTRIES, PHRACK AND PULHAS 

     Date: 7.1.1999 

     An international coalition of hackers strongly condemns the
     Legion of the Underground's (LoU) recent "declaration of
     war" against the governments of Iraq and the People's
     Republic of China. Citing human rights violations and other
     repressive measures the LoU declared their intention to
     disrupt and disable Internet infrastructures in Iraq and
     China. In a decision that was more rash than wise, the LoU
     will do little to alter existing conditions and much to
     endanger the rights of hackers around the world. 

     We - the undersigned - strongly oppose any attempt to use
     the power of hacking to threaten or destroy the information
     infrastructure of a country, for any reason. Declaring "war"
     against a country is the most irresponsible thing a hacker
     group could do. This has nothing to do with hacktivism or
     hacker ethics and is nothing a hacker could be proud of. 

     Frank Rieger of the CCC said, "Many hacker groups don't
     have a problem with Web hacks that raise public awareness
     about human rights violations. But we are very sensitive to
     people damaging networks and critical systems in repressive
     regimes or anywhere else. The police and intelligence
     communities regard hacking as seditious. It is quite possible
     now that hackers - not only in totalitarian states - could be
     jailed or executed as 'cyberterrorists' for the slightest
     infraction of the law." 

     "It is shortsighted and potentially counterproductive,"
     added Reid Fleming of the cDc. "One cannot legitimately
     hope to improve a nation's free access to information by
     working to disable its data networks." 

     "Though we may agree with LoU that the atrocities in China
     and Iraq have got to stop, we do not agree with the
     methods they are advocating," said Space Rogue of the
     L0pht. 

     Emmanuel Goldstein of 2600 said: "This kind of threat, even
     if made idly, can only serve to further alienate hackers from
     mainstream society and help to spread the misperceptions
     we're constantly battling. And what happens when someone
     in another country decides that the United States needs to
     be punished for its human rights record? This is one door
     that will be very hard to close if we allow it to be opened." 

     Governments worldwide are seeking to establish cyberspace
     as a new battleground for their artificial conflicts. The LoU
     has inadvertently legitimized this alarmist propaganda. With
     its dramatic announcement the LoU played into the hands
     of policy makers who want complete control over the
     Internet and are looking for reasons to seize it. If hackers
     solicit recognition as paramilitary factions then hacking in
     general will be seen as an act of war. Ergo, hackers will be
     viewed as legitimate targets of warring states. 

     Strategic combat planning in the United States and among
     other nations has reached the point where real-world cases
     are needed to justify assigned budgets. The LoU is
     providing this real-world case now. We believe that the LoU
     should carefully investigate the idea of declaring "war"
     against China and Iraq. Was it planted with them by
     someone with different interests in mind other than
     advancing human rights considerations? 

     The signatories to this statement are asking hackers to
     reject all actions that seek to damage the information
     infrastructure of any country. DO NOT support any acts of
     "Cyberwar." Keep the networks of communication alive.
     They are the nervous system for human progress.

     The original declaration of war by LoU    
     Legion of Underground's response 
     LoU - Legions of the Underground
     Joint Statement 7 Jan 1999 
     
     The Legions of the Underground (LoU) group was
     established some seven years ago as a group who
     researched, explored and learned about technology. LoU
     has always believed in sharing what they have learned with
     the general public, which is why we release our e-zine Keen
     Veracity, and which is why we try and promote a positive
     image towards the general public. 

     As of late, some of our members have taken it upon
     themselves to express their opinions on the state of
     conditions in China by some high profile 'cracks' and the
     defacing of some Chinese government run web servers. 

     While the LoU supports and stands by their members
     actions and, as the rest of the hacking community, agree
     that there are serious problems that need to be addressed
     in China, the statement that "the LoU wishes to declare
     'war' on China or Iraq's internal information networks in
     order to destroy, damage or harm their computers,
     systems, or networks" is totally false. The LoU does not
     support the damaging of other nations computers, networks
     or systems in any way, nor will the LoU use their skills,
     abilities or connections to take any actions against the
     systems, networks or computers in China or Iraq which may
     damage or hinder in any way their operations. 

     Although this may sound contrary to what the popular
     media has been presenting, this is a united declaration from
     the LoU and this is the groups standing on this matter. If
     you refer to the second Wired.com article on the second
     series of penetrations into Chinas Internet/Intranet, you
     can clearly see that an LoU member, in an interview with
     Niall McKay, clearly states that the second series of
     penetrations were done independently, and were not done
     as part of any LoU effort. After a series of meetings, LoU
     decided it "may, in the future, take actions against other
     Chinese systems" if other actions, like the one against Lin
     Hai, continued, but then they may only be actions along
     the same line as the simple protests taken by others in the
     past. 

     From this point, the LoU has been, for the most part, silent.
     We have taken no further actions against China, or any
     direct actions against Iraq. 

     With the size of LoU, numbering some 20 plus members, and
     our loose organization, we realize it may be hard to verify if
     someone is in fact a member, which is what may of lead to
     the rash of LoU imposters who have been issuing false
     statements regarding us and our actions. There have been
     several well known, national publications, as well as online
     and hacker culture sites that have been getting a flood of
     reports from people who say they are in LoU claiming to
     have taken 'such and such' actions, or giving interviews, or
     even saying they have allied them selves with the LoU.
     These are all false. There are also new groups who are
     'cracking' innocent sites in China, then reporting these and
     claming they are doing this in "conjuncture with" or for the
     "LoU effort". We are in no way associated with these
     groups what-so-ever. 

     In summary, on behalf of all LoU members, let me state that
     we (LoU) have taken no harmful or damaging actions
     against either Chinese or Iraqi networks or systems, or any
     other system or network in any location across the world,
     and we have no plans to do so. In addition, the LoU has not
     allied with, and is currently not working or affiliated with
     any other group or activity. We in the LoU hold strong
     integrity and a strong code of ethics, and wish nothing
     more then for fair, equal treatment for all people, and want
     nothing but a positive light shed upon this for the entire
     hacking community in general.

     Secret plan for spies to bug PCs
     By DAN TEBBUTT [The Australian]
     13-jan-99
     
     PERSONAL computers would become police spy stations under secret proposals
     put to the Federal Government by a former deputy director of ASIO. 
     
     The Australian Federal Police, ASIO and the National Crime Authority would
     be empowered to alter software to turn PCs into covert listening devices,
     according to the 1996 report by one-time spy chief Gerald Walsh. 
     
     The report also recommends changes to the Commonwealth Crimes Act to allow
     police and government investigators to hack into computer systems for
     evidence. 
     
     While Mr Walsh called for public discussion of his proposals, the report
     was withdrawn by the Attorney-General's Department. But a copy of the
     96-page document was obtained last week by Internet privacy campaigners
     Electronic Frontiers Australia and released to The Australian. 
     
     A spokesman for Attorney-General Daryl Williams confirmed last night that
     Mr Walsh's recommendations were under discussion but the report was "just
     one element" of policy being considered. 
     
     He would not say whether the controversial recommendations would be acted
     on through legislation. 
     
     Mr Walsh warns that widespread use of PC-based data scrambling is a big
     concern for law enforcement. 
     
     Criminals were already using computer encryption - programs that encode
     data so it cannot be intercepted - to prevent police from monitoring phone
     calls and e-mail. 
     
     Widespread encryption to scramble sensitive data would make crimes harder
     to prove in court, Mr Walsh warns. 
     
     "The principle of non self-incrimination may well represent the polite end
     of the possible range of responses," the report says. 
     
     Mr Walsh's plan would clear the way for police to eavesdrop on computer
     conversations at the source. 
     
     A "target computer may be converted into a listening device" that could
     seek out passwords and other private communications without the PC owner's
     knowledge. 
     
     EFA spokesman Greg Taylor said authorities might set up Trojan horse
     software that would record all PC activity, including passwords and
     e-mail, before encryption. 
     
     "If you have access to someone's PC and you change their software you can
     do anything you want," said Mr Taylor. 
     
     "If it's connected to a network such as the Internet the PC could transmit
     data to another site." 
     
     Australian Council for Civil Liberties president Terry O'Gorman said the
     proposals would be a worrying extension to police wiretap powers which
     were already over-used. 
     
     "We are concerned about the low level of protection in relation to current
     judicial warrants for telephone eavesdropping," Mr O'Gorman said. 
     
     Labor information technology spokeswoman Senator Kate Lundy said "the
     whole issue of encryption is being used as a lever to justify further
     invasions of privacy".

     By Gerard Knapp
     InternetNews.com Australia Correspondent

     [January 4, 1999--SYDNEY] Law enforcement agencies in Australia
     ought to be able to "hack" into corporate computer systems and
     change proprietary software to enable monitoring of
     communications, according to a 1996 report which had been
     censored by the Australian government but recently uncovered by a
     university student.

     The report also suggested that technology vendors could also be
     recruited to help modify software or hardware that they installed
     at a company's premises.

     However, Australian police agencies have not taken the advice,
     opting instead to concentrate their energies on interception of
     telecommunications by tapping into the systems of Internet
     service providers (ISPs).

     The report, entitled "Review of Policy relating to Encryption
     Technologies," was prepared for the Federal Attorney-General's
     Department by Gerard Walsh, a former deputy director-general of
     the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). It
     had been released in 1997 with some passages omitted after a
     request by civil liberties group Electronic Freedom Australia.

     Greg Taylor, chair of the EFA's Crypto Committee, said a
     university student in Hobart had discovered an archival copy of
     the so-called "Walsh report" with the censored material intact.

     Censored recommendations included giving police and espionage
     agencies "the authority to 'hack,' under warrant, into a
     nominated computer system as a necessary search power," and "the
     authority to alter proprietary software so that it may provide
     additional and unspecified features." These additional features
     might include "the introduction of other commands, such as
     diversion, copy, send, [or to] dump memory to a specified site,"
     the report said.

     The agencies might need to obtain the "cooperation of
     manufacturers or suppliers" to help with the insertion of these
     extra software agents.

     "When manufacturers or suppliers are satisfied the modification
     has no discernible effect on function, they may consent to assist
     or acquiesce in its installation," Walsh said in the report.

     The establishment of a separate agency to perform such work would
     approach AUS$500 million, Walsh estimated, but could be performed
     by the existing Defence Signals Directorate.

     The report recommended changes to the 1914 Crimes Act and the
     1979 Australian Federal Police Act, but the only legislative
     changes in this area were made over a year ago in the
     Telecommunication Legislation Amendment Act 1997.

     This act enabled law enforcement agencies to access
     communications directly from ISPs, and for the resulting cost to
     be incurred by the ISPs. The non-censored version of the report
     is available on the EFA's Web site.

     Making your email secret is now 30 times faster, but the innovation has
     come not from a multinational computer computer but a schoolgirl from
     Blarney, Ireland. 
     
     Sarah Flannery, 16, has developed a brand new mathematical procedure for
     encrypting internet communication. 
     
     "The algorithm is based on matrices," her father told BBC News Online. Dr
     David Flannery is a mathematics lecturer at Cork Institute of Technology,
     Ireland. 
     
     "Sarah has a very good understanding of the mathematical principles
     involved, but to call her a genius or a prodigy is overstated and she
     doesn't want that herself. 
     
     "She's a normal young girl, who likes basketball and going out with her
     friends." 
     
     International job offers
     
     But her number-crunching feat is undoubtedly remarkable and won her the
     top prize at the Irish Young Scientists and Technology Exhibition. 
     International job and scholarship offers have flooded in, said Dr
     Flannery.  Last year, Ms Flannery's cryptography skill took her to Fort
     Worth, Texas, as the winner of an Intel prize. 
     
     Even when high security levels are required, her code can encrypt a letter
     in just one minute - a widely used encryption standard called RSA would
     take 30 minutes.  "But she has also proven that her code is as secure as
     RSA," says Dr Flannery. "It wouldn't be worth a hat of straw if it was
     not." 
     
     Ms Flannery currently has a bad cold and has not had time to consider the
     advice of the judges to patent the code. "She wouldn't mind being rich but
     she wants to stress the great joy that the project has given her," says Dr
     Flannery. She may publish the work to make it freely available to all. 
     
     Her code is called Cayley-Purser after Arthur Cayley, a 19th century
     Cambridge expert on matrices, and Michael Purser, a cryptographer from
     Trinity College, Dublin, who provided inspiration for Ms Flannery.

     Fraudsters are exploiting a security loophole in banking systems that lets
     them charge credit card users for fictitious visits to pay-per-view
     Internet sites. The scam leaves victims having to explain themselves to
     spouses who wrongly believe they have been visiting pornographic sites.
      
     The swindlers bill their victims' credit cards a small monthly amount,
     typically $19.95, for visits to sites they've never seen, according to
     John Faughnan, a software developer in St Paul, Minnesota, who
     investigated the scam after falling prey to it.  Since Faughnan set up a
     website to publicise the fraud, more than 200 other victims have contacted
     him from countries including Japan, Britain, Australia, Brazil, Sweden,
     South Korea and France.
      
     Credit card verification is supposed to require a valid name, a valid card
     number and a corresponding expiry date, says Don Zimmerman of the Boston
     office of the Secret Service, which investigates credit card fraud in the
     US. Mail-order firms may also check if the delivery address matches that
     of the account.
     
     However, a spokeswoman for US Bank of Minneapolis says that firms who make
     small recurrent charges ask banks to waive these steps because repeatedly
     asking for expiry dates takes time and annoys customers. But this opens
     the door to crooks who can obtain valid card numbers.
     
     Card numbers alone provide some security because the digits must pass a
     numeric test, called a checksum, but software that generates valid numbers
     is also available on the Net. Most numbers generated don't match valid
     accounts, but those that do can be used to make charges that show up on
     the victim's bill. Racketeers can also steal card numbers used in valid
     transactions, and some lists have been posted on the Net. Extra validation
     steps can block these fraudulent charges, but Zimmerman says that
     additional security " does cost money, and there's always a bottom line"
     for banks, card processors and vendors.
     
     Faughnan blames the fraud on companies that process charges for viewing
     online pornography. Because many people who browse for porn give fake card
     numbers, processors expect high credit charge reject rates and fail to
     investigate. Most fraudulent charges list the same few vendor names, and
     he suspects they come from just one card processing group. The fraudsters
     must generate some numbers randomly, because charges have appeared on
     unused accounts, but they may also have stolen customer card numbers from
     pornographers.
     
     A spokeswoman for US Bank, where Faughnan holds the account that the
     fraudsters billed, says: "If we know a merchant has a lot of fraudulent
     transactions, we immediately report it to the proper authorities." She
     added that customers are not liable for fraudulent transactions.

     Furby toy or Furby spy? 
     BBC Webnews Jan 13th'99

     Furbies - their lips aren't sealed 

      Thousands of families across the United States could be harbouring 
     potentially dangerous double agents - also known as Furbies. 

     The Furby, a highly sought-after Christmas toy in 1998, is now a 
     high-ranking public enemy and has been banned from National Security Agency 
     premises in Maryland. 

     Anyone at the NSA coming across a Furby, or a crack team of Furbies 
     infiltrating the building has been asked to "contact their Staff Security 
     Office for guidance".

     Immediate and real danger 

     An allegedly classified NSA internal memo alerted other agents to 
     the Furby's secret embedded computer chip which allows every Furby 
     to utter 200 words - 100 in English and 100 in "Furbish." 


     Because of its ability to repeat what it hears, Security Agency officials
     were worried "that people would take them home and they'd start talking
     classified,'' according to one anonymous Capitol Hill source. 

     Photographic, video and audio recording equipment are all prohibited items 
     for employees at the NSA. 

     "This includes toys, such as 'Furbys,' with built-in recorders that 
     repeat the audio with synthesized sound to mimic the original signal," the
     Furby Alert read. 

     Furbys have ears 

     A Furby can be recognised immediately by its huge pink ears separated by
     tufts of hair. It otherwise resembles an owl, with a beak and big, round eyes. 

     But the furry, cute exterior is merely a shrewd cover for more 
     covert activities. 

     Thought to have come into circulation in May last year, the elusive 
     creatures dodged thousands of weary parents over Christmas, desperately
     scouring shop shelves to find one to take home. 

     Now, the 13-cm gremlin-like operatives are wanted again, this time for spying. 

     The fate of any Furbys uncovered at the NSA is as yet unknown, 
     presumed top secret.

      I was in a local hospital and picked up a copy of their zine to leaf
     through while waiting for my replacement Jarvex7 heart valve and came
     across the following article, quite interesting I thought, so i'm 
     sharing it with you;
     
    
      The article explains the new system and it does sound like a great idea
     although it isn't anything new. The problem I have with it is that being
     open like this the Spectralink telephones may be subject to interferance
     or possibly tampering (malicious) from outside sources. 
     
      Local ham ops have already seen previously open auto-patches on repeaters
     closed down and entire smart-repeaters rendered dumb due to abuse of the 
     auto-patches  with repeated false 911 calls etc.

H.W  Hacked Web Sites (8.0)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
     There were literally screenfuls of sites that were hacked over the xmas
     "holidays" I guess some people had some time on their hands and when 
     grandma said "you'd better get cracking if you expect to be ready for
     xmas!" the words were misread and this hack flood was the result. 
     
     Is it just me or is anyone else wondering wether the web cracks go beyond
     simple defacing of sites? ... rootkits? sniffers? major carnage could be
     done but it seems mostly people scramble to 'get the site back online' and
     only report the defacing of the web site but what else? ... --- ... oh the
     humanity.
     
     Cracking tip: You don't have to be a genius to crack a site, got a login
     to an MP3 site? (usually mp3/mp3) or a warez site (usually something
     like oh I dunno... hrm warez/warez) yeah?? wow! ok so forget for one minute
     the mindless collecting of mp3's and warez and wander instead... gee whats
     this? a passwd file hrm, and gosh a master.passwd file etc etc etc don't
     believe it could be this easy? well not that long ago people were pulling
     passwd files over the web with the phf exploit until it got hammered into
     sysadmins skulls that they were vulnerable (and some sites are STILL open
     to this and many other well known holes). No it ain't that difficult. - Ed

     Jan 12th - tucows hacked (from HNN)
     
     Someone calling themselves "UC3n1wVWGSnAk" cracked www.tucows.com early
     this morning. While the cracked site may not have been much to look at 
     it definitely was worth reading. The source that is. The source included
     URLs to various web sites and what appeared to be tucows /etc/passwd file.
     The only image on the main page was linked to SORM, a Russian Web site
     attempting to build awareness about the FSB's (Federal Security Service,
     the successor to the KGB) wiretapping program. 


      From Bikkel;
      update by demoniz at Jan 12 , 12:22 CET

      "Rumours are that the Web site of one of the worlds largest Internet
      software library's, Tucows, got cracked today. We got several emails
      about the not so usual mainpage of Tucows, which appears to be
      defaced by a Russian Linux users group. The hackers replaced the
      front door with their own version. "Long ago we have infected all the
      programs on this site (and it's mirrors ofcourse :)) by troyan-viruses,
      and that is why we were able to get access to information on many
      thousands of computers all over the net. Happy New Year ppl !!! :)" 

      The alleged Russian hackers published in the source of the cracked
      page a password file which most likely is the one they used to gain
      access to the Tucows server. The large picture of the Linux penguin
      linked to a Web site dealing with a Russian Internet Wiretapping
      Project.

     Star Wars.com cracked? update by demoniz at Jan 8 , 17:24 CET
     [ it was fixed when I checked it at 5:04pm EST - Ed ]
    
      `We lost all our faith in the Star Wars crew. Luke and his friends are
     supposed to protect the universe from evil alien creatures, but as it
     turns out, they can't even defend their homebase. Today the official
     Star Wars site of Lucasfilm Ltd was slightly modified by an evil (alien?)
     hacker. 
     
       The hacker changed some words on the mainpage. "The Evil empire is 
     watching you! hello to digit, crazy-b, luke skyw, tmoggie, gaius, cisco9,
     f11ex, angrignon, ttyp0, xcsh..." '   (is this real of a sysadmin having
     some fun?) it wouldn't be the first time a site has been party to a fake
     hack for publicity...- Ed )

A.A  Why I love Microsoft
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      Read it and weep, I recently subbed to this list recently and had the
     tremendous pleasure of reading this novel on sign-up when a few lines
     would have sufficed, reprinted here in its entirety not merely to take
     up space and infuriate people (i'd have put it in the main body if it
     was to meant to annoy) but as a model for others to follow. Let MS lead
     you on your way to the future, gh0d bless...Thanks Bill. we all have 
     giga-quad bandwidth straight to our asses.
     
     Date:         Sun, 3 Jan 1999 06:00:14 -0500
     From: "L-Soft list server at Microsoft \(1.8d\)" &lt;LISTSERV@ANNOUNCE.MICROSOFT.COM>
     Subject:      Subscription probe for MICROSOFT_SECURITY - please ignore
     To: myass@HZ.NOW
     X-LSV-ListID: MICROSOFT_SECURITY
     
     Sun, 3 Jan 1999 06:00:14
     
     This message is  only a "probe" to  test that the email  address for your
     subscription to  the MICROSOFT_SECURITY list is  still working correctly.
     You do not need to take any  action to remain subscribed to the list, and
     in particular  you should NOT  reply to  this message. Simply  discard it
     now, or  read on if you  would like to  know more about how  this probing
     mechanism works.
                                *******************
     A  "probe"  is a  message  like  the one  you  are  reading, sent  to  an
     individual subscriber  and tagged  with a  special signature  to uniquely
     identify  this  particular  subscriber  (you can  probably  not  see  the
     signature because it is in the  mail headers). If the subscriber's e-mail
     address is no longer valid, the  message will be returned to LISTSERV and
     the faulty  address will be  removed from  the list. If  the subscriber's
     address is still valid, the message will not bounce and the user will not
     be deleted.
     
     The main advantage  of this technique is that it  can be fully automated;
     the list owner does not need to read a single delivery error. For a large
     or active  list, the manpower  savings can  be tremendous. In  fact, some
     lists are  so large that it  is virtually impossible to  process delivery
     errors manually. Another advantage is that the special, unique signatures
     make it possible to accurately process delivery errors that are otherwise
     unintelligible, even to an experienced technical person.
     
     The  drawback,  however,  is  that  this  method  lacks  flexibility  and
     forgiveness. Since the Internet does not provide a reliable mechanism for
     probing an  e-mail address without  actually delivering a message  to the
     human  recipient, the  subscribers  need to  be  inconvenienced with  yet
     another "junk message". And, unlike  a human list owner, LISTSERV follows
     a number of  simple rules in determining when and  whether to terminate a
     subscription. In  particular, a common  problem with automatic  probes is
     mail gateways  that return a delivery  error, but do deliver  the message
     anyway.  LISTSERV  has no  way  to  know that  the  message  was in  fact
     delivered, and in most cases the subscriber is not aware of the existence
     of these  "false" error reports.  If this  happens to you,  LISTSERV will
     send you  another message with a  copy of the delivery  error returned by
     your mail system, so that you can show it to your technical people.
