   Synopsis
   --------     
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    What is Bugtraq?     

    Bugtraq is a full-disclosure UNIX security mailing list, (see the info
    file) started by Scott Chasin &lt;chasin@crimelab.com>. To subscribe to 
    bugtraq, send mail to listserv@netspace.org containing the message body

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file: 

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them. 

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their 
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of 
    security holes and risks. 

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter. 

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list. 

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list: 

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present) 
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above 
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes 
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings 
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security 
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures 
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations 
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting 

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria. 

    Remember: YOYOW. 

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on this list and that reproduction of
    those words without your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be challenged by you, the author. 

    For questions or comments, please mail me:

  0.4  Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.
     
     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you 
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost 
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff
     

   

  0.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
    Also released in issue #3. (unchanged) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.
    
    @HWA  - see EoA  ;-)
    !=    - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
            ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
            an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
            to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint 
            fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)      
    AAM   - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)
   *AOL   - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
            clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
            not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
            least they could try leasing one??
    CC    - Credit Card phraud
    CCC   - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)               
    EoC   - End of Commentary
    EoA   - End of Article or more commonly @HWA
    EoF   - End of file
    EoD   - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)

      disqualify. Intel filed the motion under seal last month. The company
      declined to comment on its grounds for disqualifying Parker, but
      Parker's former law firm, O'Melveny & Myers, represented Advanced Micro
      Devices in its court battles with Intel in the early '90s, and former
      O'Melveny partner Tom McCoy left the firm to become AMD's general

        The future of Hacking some people do not think about...But as I was
      browsing CyberArmy.com's WWWBoard for some interesting conversations I
      was bombarded by messages saying "Anyone have a Win98 Spoofer" and "How
      do you find out someone's IP number in AOL" and such things like that. 
      
       These tell me one thing about a  person...LAMER! These people do not
      know any other OS except Winblowz and like to nuke and punt people for 
      whatever immature reason. They like to send out virii and scerew up 
      someone's computer for no absolute reason. If I ever met one of these 
      people in person you know what I would see? I would see a 13 yr. old boy
      (or girl) cowering behind his WinNuke walking around a computer store 
      asking people if they memorized there IP number and if they did, can they
      give it to him. Now I realize that i'm generalizing packet warriors at 
      around teen years, but I won't be quick to speak for all 13 yr olds. Some
      of them may have a great understanding of Unix and all its other variations
      and might be more l33t than yours truly. But if you've ever gotten into a 
      fight with someone from AOL, or any other packet warrior they think there 
      hackers and they try to mailbomb you and nuke you, icmp you, and any other
      windows based attack. Not to say that I hate AOL, it's just some packet 
      warrior newbies, meaning new to DoS attacks and such are usually from AOL,
      and they started out using punters. In fact I think AOL is good for people
      that don't have that much experience with being online and on the internet,
      AOL provides a lovely user interface, and is definitely user friendly. Now
      if these people ever got into Linux they would probaly be teardropping and
      smurfing everybody but that's not the case because there to illiterate to 
      new information. 
      
       The information they could find on Webpages by spending 2 to 3 hours 
      everyday reading articles is amazing. But they choose not to. I didn't say
      they were to dumb to learn how to use any other OS, or to learn some of the
      flaws of a system. They just don't want to, to learn something you have to 
      want to learn it. But when they finally, maybe, when when they r00t there 
      first server, they usually did it by an exploit. Script kiddies aren't that
      bad, to exploit the bug in the system you must first upload the exploit, to
      upload something you need an account? How did they get the account? Well 
      probaly by getting the passwd file and cracking it if it's not shadowed. 
      This is better than having them running around IRC shoving packets down 
      peoples throats. At least there out there learning atleast SOMETHING from
      hacking a server. 
      
        I would rather have them find some other way to gain entry to a server 
      but hey, somethings will never change. I'm truly interested too see what
      the future of Hacking will have instore for us.

           pDX![ pArAd0x ]
       ----------------------------

       Slightly reformatted/edited for clarity - Ed
       
      Introduction
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Earlier in the year, I found an article on the web that eZoOns wrote
      about hacking Angelfire. The method of social engineering and method to
      hack Angelfire was insignificant. I offer you what I think is a better 
      article. Remember this is for educational purposes only and I take no 
      responsibility for what you might do with this information.

      First Things First
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
	Well first you have to get the page that you get right after you login 
      to your Angelfire account. This page is called BEDIT.HTML And a couple 
      ines down from the &lt;html> is their password. 
      
      &lt;font color=teal>Your page 
       &lt;a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ak2/r00t7/index.html">
       http://www.angelfire.com/mi/KrazieBread/index.html &lt;/a> has been saved.
      &lt;br>
      You may have to click Reload or Super-Reload (Shift+Reload) to see your 
       edited page and not your old version when you go to your URL.
      &lt;br>You can also announce your new page on 
      &lt;a href="http://homepages.whowhere.com/bin/showpage.pl?add">WhoWhere?&lt;/a>, 
      &lt;a href="http://newtoo.manifest.com/">&lt;u>What's New Too!&lt;/u>&lt;/a>, or if you
       really want to get noticed, go to &lt;a href="http://www.submit-it.com/">
       &lt;u>Submit It!&lt;/u>&lt;/a>&lt;br>Tune up your Web Site at the 
       &lt;a href="http://www.angelfire.com/cgi-bin/ct?ad=websitegarage&vp=/index.
        clicked&ru=http://www.websitegarage.com/whowhere">Web Site Garage&lt;/a>.&lt;/font>
      &lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>&lt;/center>
      &lt;form select method="post" action="http://www.angelfire.com/cgi-bin/bedit">
      &lt;input type="hidden" name="storage"  value="mi">
      &lt;input type="hidden" name="hpd"      value="r00t">     
      &lt;input type="hidden" name="password" value="r00t7">  <-------THE PASSWORD!!!

     Alright so now you know where the password is, finding the username is a synch 
     because it's in their URL. Http://www.angelfire.com/whatever/USERNAME/
     
      This is a dumb flaw in the Angelfire user security, yet a very dangerous one if used
     right.Kind of lame actually.
     
     Moving in for the Kill
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Ok first things first

     1.)  Find some guy that you want to hack and tell him that you found a bug 
          in IE 4.0 and Netscape Communicator that let's you install keyloggers 
          and packet sniffers on their system through a perl script. 

     2.)  Tell the guy you need his bedit.html page because you need some of the
          info on there, cause if you don't have it the script won't work.

     3.)  After he sends u the file get the shit you need...Login, and then from 
          the bedit.html page click change e-mail (don't use your real one) one 
          from Hotmail or something.

     4.)  Whatever you want to do with the page is your choice, but remember..
          be mature about it and don't do anything you'll regret later..that 
          line sounded stupid.

     Conclusion
     ~~~~~~~~~~
	Well I hope you've enjoyed this article. Thanx to eZoOns for discovering
     this vulnerability in the Angelfire system. And greetz to IllumiTIE,

      BTW, although Hotmail is a favourite of 'hackers' make sure you all realize
     that whatever ip you are logged in from when sending a message is INCLUDED
     in the HEADERS of your message. Not everyone can see these if they are using
     some shit software by a small concern called Mircosloth or Mickeysnoft or 
     some wacked shit like that so be forewarned, HOTMAIL IS NOT ANONYMOUS and using
     a hacked acct to send the mail can be incriminating so be careful, use a mail
     forwarding service like netaddress and nightmail, anyone wanna do an article 
     on anonymous mailing/receiving? - Ed

  3.2 Some underground prose by Liquid Phire 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I really liked this, it grabs you by the short hairs and pulls tightly
      read it and understand, for this is very much what it is like to be a 
      part of the underground as a newbie and beyond. - Ed
      
      
      
      Reorder
      (c) 1999 phiregod
      
      i am a hunter, searching this underground of electricity for an indiana 
      jones-esque treasure. i plunge through the piles of bullshit, and sever 
      the arteries of the sane. i found god, and i wasnt pleased, i found the 
      messiah, and i wasnt saved. my very soul did i lay upon the altar, and 
      when i lost it, i found it never was. 
      
      machiavellian superheros shook my hand and turned their backs. my vision 
      was clouded by the ciggerette smoke, and my voice was hindered by a well 
      meaning gag. i placed my hands on the planchette and found the answer 
      that i already knew.
      
      on a bloody sunday, i covered my eyes as to not see the plague. i felt 
      the refreshing rain of revolution on my burning skin and i cried. i 
      climbed the highest mountian i could find, surmounted the greatest 
      challange and i found not even that was enough to distract me from the 
      pain i felt. there are too many people to save, too many to even count.
      
      i read every bit of weathered parchment that i coud find, i plundered 
      the the lair of every thief in search of text that would provide 
      redemption. i gazed into the cherubic eyes, i smiled back at the chesire 
      grins, i found no path to follow. at this point it was obvious that i 
      would have to cut the road myself.
      
      The line was busy.
      The line was busy.
      The line was busy.
      The line was busy.
      The line was busy.
      
      as a draw another breath through my hookah of modern voodoo an image of 
      a brave new world floods my mind. this sarcophagus of a free medium is 
      merely another channel to convey advertisements. the few that dare to 
      betray what they were born for, are hunted by those that serve the 
      institution that we call a government. this house of cards that we 
      reside in will not protect us from the inevitable storm.
      
      i have joined the danse macabre, i close my eyes to avoid the light. in 
      this year 1984 i feel forced to conform to a norm that doesnt exsist. 
      fleeting glimpses of a better place catch my eye as i take the hand of 
      anubis and desend into the world i belong. in these apocalyptic times it 
      is easier to turn away then to face the fight.
      
      i listen to the anthems of every power crazed country, i've found 
      occasion to sing along, looking for a cause to fight for. more people 
      here are looking for fame and fortune, i became a god when i lost the 
      desire to obtain what i couldnt have. i was baptized in the runoff the 
      the information super highway, yes, it even rains in hell.
      
      i've shed my armor of warez, i burned the castle of manuals, and i'm 
      trying to say what others cant put into words. i followed dante's 
      footsteps, and i drank hamlet's wine. if i'm going to die then i have 
      nothing left to lose. if i seek not fame or fortune, i have nothing left 
      to win. i want every scrap of information that was ever given birth to 
      in this maquis, i seek to become the personifacation of what no one can 
      have.
      
      this is the manifesto of the product of modern life; money, comic books, 
      games, knowledge, and sex. i'm not claiming everyone belives this, i 
      doubt many of the few that will read it will understand in a vauge way 
      what i am trying to say. thats not a bad thing, the more poeple that are 
      blind, the easier it will be to slip by unnoticed. this is where i 
      belong, a faceless name, in all the faceless names that swarm the 
      internet.

      I took the liberty of naming this piece "reorder" the phreaks will 
      understand this one, hope phiregod doesn't mind, keep writing and 
      don't give up, some of us do understand ... - Ed

  4.0 The LoU irc log with comments from ex-LoU member Bronc Buster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I was unable to release this earlier because my source was not given permission
      to pass this on, however things have settled somewhat and it is now "ok" to 
      include here so here it is in its' entirety, hopefully it will shed a bit of 
      light on the whole LoU situation or at least add to the intrigue, unabridged
      please note that none of this information has been confirmed and the source is
      "unknown" please remember this when reading, however it does look legit and jives
      with what we have seen in the past regarding the LoU story, machine names of people
      joining the chat have been REMOVED by me for obvious reasons ... 
      
      * NOTE * An informative message and some enlightened words follow this log 
      (no apologies for the length we try to put out news with as little 'editing' as
      possible..) from Bronc Buster whom has, effective two days prior to this writing
      resigned from LoU on friendly terms. - Ed

      consideration, and we are giving it to you
      [04:30] &lt;optiklenz> as a whole
      [04:31] &lt;DigiEbola> part of the reason, the press blew this up, is becaus=

      [04:56] &lt;Nikkita> delam: nope, just the connection
      [04:56] &lt;Father> What does "in USA stationed equipment"?
      [04:56] &lt;Nikkita> it has IP traffic, which I use
      [04:57] &lt;Nikkita> delam: typing cisco as a password in a Cisco router isn=
      't
      hacking...

      [04:58] &lt;dyslexia> heh, it might not be hacking, but it is truly sad how
      often it works
      [04:59] &lt;Nikkita> Father: a router is located fysical in USA, I connect t=
      o
      that, en then will from ther connect to a server in the Netherlands,
      [04:59] &lt;delam> that's the state of the world with technology
      [04:59] &lt;Father> Bottom line: (1) authorized access; (2) on computer
      connected to Interent; (3) where there is "some" connection to U.S. or
      Inernational seas, air, shops, or the like, equals prosecutable crime in
      US., even you and computer(s) never step foot on US soil.  Gabish?  Broad
      statute.
      [04:59] &lt;Father> Nikkita:  Yep.  You got warrant.
      [04:59] &lt;Nikkita> father: but I don't do a crime in the Netherlands..
      [04:59] &lt;delam> authorized access is the key to this issue.. if authorize=
      d
      isn't stated and you guess a password and get in.. have you committed a
      crime?  I'd say no
      [05:00] &lt;Nikkita> delam: I say no ...
      [05:00] &lt;Father> So?  Its not Netherlands statute.  Its US statute.
      [05:00] &lt;Father> Delam:  Guessing password and using it is unauthorized
      access.
      [05:00] &lt;Nikkita> Try this for an example at Hotmail...
      [05:00] &lt;Nikkita> user: john2
      [05:00] &lt;Nikkita> pass: john
      [05:00] &lt;Nikkita> user: hank2
      [05:00] &lt;Nikkita> pass: hank
      [05:01] &lt;Father> No thanks.
      [05:01] &lt;feur> father, what about statute interpreation, that without
      warning banner, there is no unauthorized entry, all entry is fine
      [05:01] &lt;Nikkita> just by guessing...
      [05:01] &lt;delam> the problem with internet protocols are taht certain TCP/=
      IP
      ports do not have the ability built into the protocol to post a banner..
      therefore, the issue of "authorized" can never be established by the pers=
      on
      running the computer
      [05:02] &lt;Father> Feur:  Wrong.  That warning banner issue has to do with
      whether the US government can monitor you without a warrant.
      [05:02] &lt;feur> or "rights without remedy"
      [05:02] &lt;delam> if there is a banner on port 23 taht says "you must work
      here to enter" and a hacker finds port 21 with no banner and enters, even
      while guessing a passowrd, have they committed a crime?/ the couldn't see
      any sign that said "keep out"
      [05:02] &lt;Nikkita> feur: in Scandinavian countries they MUST have fysical
      saying that you may not enter whitout authoring.
      [05:03] &lt;Father> Sign that says keep out is not imortatnt.  Sign that say=
      s
      come on in is.
      [05:03] &lt;Father> sorry
     
      [05:03] &lt;Father> (Hey, feds are tough.)_
      [05:03] &lt;delam> how do you establish "authorized access" when a computer =
      has
      been connected to a public network without any signs?? I'd say that impli=
      es
      it's meant for the public
      [05:04] &lt;feur> interesting you say that father, my partner is a crimianl
      attorney in boston, and is defending an elctronic perimeter intrusion
      [05:04] &lt;Father> Depends on what the purpose of it being connected is.
      [05:04] &lt;Nikkita> delam: just like sending mail to another country, that
      packets will travell along dosen systems without asking for permission
      [05:04] &lt;delam> you're posed with the problem taht you cannot from the
      outside determine what it's purpose is, but your intent is to enter
      [05:05] &lt;Father> Who is your partner?
      [05:05] &lt;Nikkita> partner?
      [05:06] &lt;Father> Fleur:  who is your partner?
      [05:06] &lt;Father> Savage?  Silverglate?

      Prior to posting this here I contacted Bronc Buster and he was kind enough
     to get back to me with some of the inside story on what happened and why..

     I thank you for contacting someone and telling us about this. I'll tell
     you what this log is, and what it is about. The l00zerz over at Infowar
     decided they wanted to try and get a peace of the LoU story, so they
     offered to organize a 'secret' meeting with 'professionals' in the
     security and intelligance world to offer us advice after the China hacks
     because it was confermed that the Chinese Govt sent out a memo to some
     internal security group and told them to 'actively' look for me and
     Zyklon.
     
     Because Winn knows that I know he is nothing but a fake, he tried to
     exclude me and Zyklon from the meeting altogeather. As you can see from
     the logs it worked. Once I had been told by other LoU members about it I
     contacted Winn and Betty asking what this was all about. They said it was
     nothing and was not going to happen and to not be concerned. 
     
     As you can see they conspired with the rest of LoU to exclude me (maybe
     Zyklon as well) so that they could have this meeting. What they talked
     about I had no idea until I saw this log. I was told it never took place.
     
     It's funny, me and Zyklon were the people in hot water, and we were the
     ones not included. It's a case of nothing more then the people at Infowar
     wanting a peace of a big story and getting their grubby hands into this
     whole mess.
     
     I don't want to say anything negative about LoU, so suffice it to say, I
     am no longer affiliated with LoU in any way, shape or form. 
     
     If you want to print any of this in your news letter, or if HNN wants to
     print any of this you may, with the exception of anything that I may of
     let slip out about LoU, or any negative comments against LoU. We parted
     ways, you guys can see the BS that surrounded it..
     
     Again, thanks for contacting me
     
     regards,
   áá Bronc Buster

       Microsoft has received no reports of customers being adversely affected by
       this problem. However, it is releasing this security bulletin in order to
       proactively provide customers with information about the problem in order to
       allow them to take steps to ensure their safe computing.
       
       Issue
       =====
       When a user chooses to install SQL Server (R), Exchange Server (R) or
       Microsoft Transaction Server (R) as part of a BackOffice 4.0 installation,
       the BackOffice installer program requests the name and password for the
       accounts associated with these services. Specifically, it asks for the
       account name and password for the SQL Executive Logon account, the Exchange
       Services Account, and the MTS Remote Administration Account. These values
       are stored in &lt;systemdrive>\Program Files\Microsoft Backoffice\Reboot.ini,
       and used to install the associated services.
       
       BackOffice Server does not erase this file when the installation process is
       completed. This is true regardless of whether the installation process
       completes successfully or unsuccessfully. By default, the Microsoft
       BackOffice folder is not shared, so network access to reboot.ini generally
       does not pose a risk. Users who can log onto the server locally would be
       able to access the file, but in most cases this ability is granted only to
       selected users such as administrators.
       
       The fix for this problem is to delete the file &lt;systemdrive>\Program
       Files\Microsoft Backoffice\Reboot.ini after each BackOffice 4.0
       installation, whether successful or not. The file is created only by the
       installer, and, once deleted, will not be re-created unless BackOffice 4.0
       is re-installed.

      A fully supported patch is available for this vulnerability, and Microsoft
      recommends that all customers evaluate the risk to their systems and, as
      appropriate, download and install it on affected computers.
      
      Issue
      =====
      The Windows NT Security Account Manager (SAM) database stores the hashed
      password for each user account in two forms: an "NT hash" form that is used
      to authenticate users on Windows NT clients, and an "LM hash" form that is
      used to authenticate users on Windows 95, Windows 98, and downlevel clients
      such as DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2 and Macintosh. When a
      user changes his password via a Windows NT, Windows 95 or Windows 98 client,
      both the "NT hash" and "LM hash" forms of the password are updated in the
      SAM. However, when the user changes his password via a downlevel client,
      only the "LM hash" form of the password is stored; a null value is stored in
      the "NT hash" field. This is normal operation.
      
      When a user attempts an interactive logon or a network share connection from
      a Windows NT system, the Windows NT authentication process uses the "NT
      hash" form of the password. If the "NT hash" is null, the "LM hash" of the
      password is used for verification. (Windows 95, Windows 98 and downlevel
      clients always use only the "LM hash" for verification.) The logic error in
      Service Pack 4 incorrectly allows a null "NT hash" value to be used for
      authentication from Windows NT systems. The result is that if a user
      account's password was last changed from a DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows for
      Workgroups, OS/2 or Macintosh client, a user can logon into that account
      from a Windows NT system using a blank password.
      
      By far the most likely machines to be affected by this vulnerability would
      be domain controllers running Windows NT 4.0 SP 4, in networks that contain
      any of the downlevel clients listed above. However, any server or
      workstation running Windows NT 4.0 SP 4 that contains a SAM database with
      active users who communicate from downlevel clients would be vulnerable to
      this problem. For example, a workgroup of Windows NT 4.0 SP 4 systems, one
      of which is accessed by Windows for Workgroups clients, would be affected by
      
this vulnerability.
      
      It is worth reiterating the following points:
      - Even on an affected network, a user whose most recent
      áá password change was performed via Windows NT, Windows 95
      áá or Windows 98 workstations will have a non-null "NT hash"
      áá value, and hence will not be at risk.
      - Customers who are affected by the vulnerability need only
      áá apply the patch to machines that contain SAM databases
      áá with active user accounts.
      - There is no need for users to update or change their passwords
      áá after applying the patch. Even in vulnerable systems, the SAM
      áá database entries are valid; the problem lies in the way SP4
      áá processes them. The patch corrects the authentication process
      áá logic in SP4 without changing the SAM database entries in any way.
      
      Affected Software Versions
      ==========================
      The following software versions are affected:
      - Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Service Pack 4

       Multiple SLMail Vulnerabilities
       
       Systems Affected
       SLMail 3.1
       
       Release Date
       February 04, 1999
       
       Advisory Code
       AD02041999
       
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       Description:
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       We were once again grinding software through Retina Alpha code and have
       found the following.
       
       One of the ports that SLMail's POP Service listens on is port 27. It
       provides ESMTP functionality. The only difference between it and SLMail's
       SMTP service is that port 27 provides the "turn" functions. All
       vulnerabilities are based off of the port 27 service.
       
       The first vulnerability involves the "helo" command. There are two
       vulnerabilities within it. The first is sending "helo" followed by 819 to
       849 characters. This will send the servers CPU to idle around 90%.
       
       The second vulnerability in the "helo" command is a buffer overflow. If you
       issue "helo" followed by 855 to 2041 characters the server will crash with
       your typical overflow error.
       
       The second set of vulnerabilities are with the "vrfy" and "expn" commands.
       We have not tested to find the start and stop string lengths but sending
       "vrfy" or "expn" with 2041 characters will cause the SLMail.exe to exit
       itself.
       
       So we can either send the CPU to 90%, overflow some buffers, or have the
       server exit without a trace. Take your pick.

  6.0  Arbitrary command execution in Pine in latest release
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              
       Date: Mon, 8 Feb 1999 00:22:17 +0100

       Subject: remote exploit on pine 4.10 - neverending story?
       
       Affected systems:
       -----------------
       
         Any Un*x system running 'pine' up to version 4.10 (latest).
       
       Compromise:
       -----------
       
         Remote execution of arbitrary code when message is viewed.
       
       Details:
       --------
       
         About five months ago, I reported vunerability in metamail package used
         with pine. I also noticed that '`' character is incorrectly expanded by
         pine. Problem has been ignored (probably noone understood what I am
         talking about?;-). But no matter. An exception from /etc/mailcap:
       
         text/plain; shownonascii iso-8859-1 %s; test=test "`echo %{charset} | tr
         '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`" = iso-8859-1; copiousoutput
       
       Impact:
       -------
       
         And now, ladies and gentelmen - my old bug, reinvented. Usually, above
         mailcap line is expanded to:
       
         [...] execve &lt;/bin/sh> (sh) (-c) (test "`echo 'US-ASCII' | tr '[A-Z]'
               '[a-z]'`" = iso-8859-1)
       
         Hmm, but take a look at this message:
       
       ************************** MIME MESSAGE FOLLOWS **************************
       >From: Attacker &lt;attacker@eleet.net>

       Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="wish.c"
       
       ...it could be your last.
       *************************** MIME MESSAGE ENDS ***************************
       
        The result is:
       
         [...] execve &lt;/bin/sh> (sh) (-c) (test "`echo '``touch${IFS}ME``' | tr
               '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`" = iso-8859-1)
       
         ...and arbitrary code ('touch ME', encoded using ${IFS} trick) is
         executed when message is viewed.
       
       Fix:
       ----
       
         Well, it's the second time I report problems with ` in headers.
         Maybe pine developers should wait a little longer ;-)

  7.0  Hacking in Germany by Qubik
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Hacking in Germany.
       ⌐1999 HWA/Qubik

         Though visiting Germany is a very common thing for myself, the trip
       I took last month was the first where I've actually looked into the 
       Germany hacker scene..

         The German press seem to support so much of the hacker ethic, the
       magazines and newspapers are full of interesting interviews, updates
       and facts. Rather than trying to cover up the fact that hacker exist,
       like so many others do, they embrace the fact and try to teach the 
       country of what they do and why they do it. Take for example, CHIP, 
       it's a computer magazine full of interesting news, not just pages and
       pages of adverts! One of the articles compares the new generation of 
       hackers, against what is seen in films. It's full of information on 
       the CCC, Karl Koch and an interesting interview with Christoph Fischer,
       who doesn't seem like an idiot reading a script..!

        This all leads to a strange, yet pleasing, affect, whereby both the 
       hacker and your average Joe, get along without much tension, and from
       the impression I got from my associates, hackers in Germany are widely
       respected.

        But even in the heaven of Germany, hackerdom is looked down on upon by
       many, but at least there's a distinction between the good and bad hackers.
       Who knows, maybe one day I'll move to Germany and live in reasonable peace..

8.0  Spotlight on: Project Gamma
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
  
       Underground Sites - Project Gamma
       ⌐1999 HWA/Qubik
  
         In the first of a continuing series of reviews, I take a look into a 
       group called Project Gamma. Who are they? What do they do? And why do 
       they  do it!? Despite consisting of a nice layout and some great content, 
       Project Gamma has remained one of the more hidden underground sites. 
       Having come from solid background as a division of Gamma Force, it's
       slowly grown into a widely respected resource..
  
         It's current membership stands at a healthy five, with the webmaster, 
       WHiTe VaMPiRe, working non-stop to keep everything working smoothly. The
       site includes some good news content, specifically targeted at the 
       underground and some great extras such as the Top100 and webrings.
  
         I spoke to him and asked him what it was that compelled him to work as 
       hard as he does, and like a seasoned spokesperson, he replied with an almost
       scripted answer..  "I'm just trying to make the most out of my time online."
       We all know the truth of being an admin of any site, is the attention we get
       from the opposite sex..!
  
        This site deserves more visitors, so if you've got to see one site today,
       why not make it this one!?

      This is gawd knows how many times in recent weeks that a "misconfigured"

      secure servers or at least supposedly stored in confidence, this time 
      Hallmark sucks the bullet for this boner:
      
      
     Hallmark computer glitch sends intimate online
     greetings into public cyberspace 

      Copyright ⌐ 1999 Nando Media
      Copyright ⌐ 1999 Associated Press

     KANSAS CITY, Mo. (February 12, 1999 7:50 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - The lovers and
     flirts sending e-mail Valentines and other notes on Hallmark Cards' online site no doubt
     intended their musings to be perused only by that special someone. 
     
     Unwittingly, they had a potential audience of millions. 
     
     A programming error at hallmark.com allowed anyone with a computer and some curiosity to
     search the Web site for private love notes - and, in many cases, the senders' name, home and
     e-mail addresses and place of employment. 
     
     The security breach surprised customers and executives at the Kansas City-based company,
     which this week scrambled to modify the computer program after The Kansas City Star
     reported the problem. Technicians have since deleted all of the old messages. 
     
     A Hallmark official said the problem involved only greetings sent a year or more ago. 
     
     "It was a programming error," company spokeswoman Julie O'Dell said. "We certainly are
     committed to providing privacy." 
     
     The recipient of a cyber Hallmark greeting card first gets an e-mail from the company, including
     a password. Then he or she clicks on a Web address to view the card. 
     
     But until this week, all those messages were available to anyone who used the site's search
     engine, the newspaper reported. That means if the word "bear" was typed, for example,
     Hallmark's computer would have given you a list of Web pages including that word - including
     one page featuring a sweet message from "Teddy Bear" to his "Honey." 
     
     "I had no idea," said Gary Harders of Chicago, who sent one of the cards to his wife. "I
     assumed it was private. 
     
     "It defeats the whole purpose of sending somebody a personal card if everybody and his
     brother is going to get ahold of it. It could be embarrassing." 
     
     O'Dell said she had no idea how many people might have clicked through the greetings. 
     
     "This new system has, built in, a new standard to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen
     again," she said. "We don't want a lot of people worried. None of the recent electronic
     greetings were in that file." 
     
     According to the Star, some of the messages were obviously not meant for mass consumption.
     Among them: 
     
     - "Gary & I have been having secret cyber sex via computer." 
     
     - "I've seen you swing a sledge hammer and the way your muscles ripple ... is amazing." 
     
     - "You deserve an extra foot massage tonight!" 
     
     Another writer e-mailed an intimate message and a photo of a flower to a woman friend, trying
     to entice her into a romantic rendezvous. 
     
     "You will have the greatest time you've had in 15 years," he assured his friend - unless the other
     man in her life persuaded her to stay home with him and their children instead.

        Michigan medical records accidentally posted on Web
        for two months

        ANN ARBOR, Mich. (February 12, 1999 12:22 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com)
        - Several thousand patient records at the University of Michigan Medical Center
        were available through public Internet sites for two months. 
       
       "Luckily, we were notified and able to stop it this time before real damage was 
       done," spokesman Dave Wilkins said. "Still, on all fronts, we're taking it very
       seriously." 
           
       The problem was discovered Monday when a university student searching for information
       about a doctor on the medical center's Web site was linked to files containing private
       patient records.
             
       The records contained names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers,
       employment status, treatments for specific medical conditions and other data. The
       information was used to schedule appointments, Wilkins said. 
       
       No one accessed the records until Monday, he said. 
       
       "I'm certainly not happy about it," said Cary Johnson, a nurse at the medical center whose
       2-year-old son's record was exposed. "I guess technology is helping us to do some things and
       hurting us in other ways." 
        
       (Sounds like a real pain in the ass ... this reminds me of a time way back in the 80's
       when a local drugstore kindly donated an old Ohio Scientific multi-processor 6502
       based machine with a 17" winchester drive in it, complete with medical records, to
       my computer collection, so much for privacy, guess we haven't come much further
       in regards to people's medical record privacy today. I mean sure I have an honest
       face but... maybe someday i'll put that box on the net, or perhaps it would make
       a great bar fridge or safe housing..hrm..but I digress. - Ed)

 11.0  Free email account vulnerabilities
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       I've mentioned before that Hotmail and the like are not anonymous services and it
       should come as no surprise to anyone that they are also likely targets for crackers
       and are probably (I wouldn't know *g*) full of security holes. The biggest "hole"
       is that unlimited password attempts are allowed and anyone with a real determination
       to get in that knows anything at all about the target will probably succeed..eventually
       there are other vulnerabilities beyond the scope of this article that are not discussed
       and imho more frightening but basically if you want "secure" email ENCRYPT it, if you
       want anonymity, use nightmail or a remailer but that involves some work on your part.

      Freemail Vulnerabilities

      If you have an account on Hotmail, Yahoo!, or Excite, it's vulnerable to hackers.
      By Ira Winkler  February 10, 1999 
      
      Free email services are a common feature on portal sites, but some of them have serious
      security vulnerabilities-- specifically, Yahoo! Mail, Excite Mail, and Hotmail. 

      First, these three services allow an unlimited number of log-on attempts. This means that
      malicious Internet users can perform password guessing and "brute force" password attacks
      against accounts on those systems. (After three failed log-in attempts, Yahoo! does ask the
      supposed user if they require help. However, additional log-in attempts are not prevented.) 

      Second, the user is not notified when a number of failed log-in attempts have occurred. If a
      password attack had been attempted against a user account, the user has no way of knowing. 

      These vulnerabilities affect a lot of Internet surfers. Free email services are extremely
      popular as a Web-based alternative to regular Internet service provider accounts. The ability to
      access mail from any Web browser and a certain level of Internet anonymity are great advantages
      that these accounts offer. Security, however, is a distinct disadvantage. 

      The problems probably are not limited to Yahoo!, Excite, and Hotmail. To test whether a particular
      site is vulnerable to a brute-force attack, simply try entering incorrect passwords. If the system
      allows more than ten invalid password entries  without locking out the account, then it probably
      allows an unlimited number of password-cracking attempts. 

      Password crackers attempt to obtain an account's password by exhaustively guessing
      word and number combinations. For example, an attacker may use a dictionary as the source of
      words. More sophisticated password crackers will use word-and-number combinations, such as
      star99. The most time-consuming technique is to try every possible combination of letters,
      numbers, and special characters. Such attacks can easily be automated. Password cracking is
      an extremely common hacker technique. 

      To prevent brute-force attacks, a security function should lock an account after an
      excessive number of failed log-in attempts, typically three to five. Once an account is
      locked, the user should be emailed about the failed log-in attempts and told to contact the
      system administrators, who will verify the user's identity. While this would cause a temporary
      interruption of service, it would prevent the account from being compromised. This is a
      basic security practice that is built into most computer operating systems. 

      Admittedly, these vulnerabilities are extremely basic. I was not expecting them to exist on all
      the systems I examined. I take their presence as an indication that security was not a crucial step
      in designing these systems. 
      
      While the sites all state that users should choose their passwords well, they do not
      account for attacks that can compromise even the best passwords. This leaves users, who
      number in the thousands or even hundreds of thousands (industry numbers measure accounts,
      not the number of users), vulnerable to someone with even trivial programming and hacking skills. 

      While no attacks have been reported, it is likely that they were attempted. It is also a given that
      they will be attempted and successful unless action is taken. 

      I contacted Yahoo! and Excite press liaisons about this issue and received no official reply.
      Hotmail could not be reached by telephone, and email messages to its technical support groups
      were not returned.

       QUEBEC WANTS CHALLENGERS TO TEST ITS COMPUTER SECURITY

       PAUL CHERRY
       The Gazette

       The provincial government is to enlist hackers to test the security
       of its information networks. 

       A laboratory will be set up using the same computers - standard
       desktops with 400 megahertz Intel processors - used by many
       government services "as well as those used by hackers,"
       Paul-Andre Comeau, president of the province's Access to
       Information Commission, said yesterday. 

       The aim is inform people in charge of computers of recent
       innovations and of the relative advantages or disadvantages of
       new gadgets. 

       "We will also be able to check out how safe the systems can be
       and how they can be improved," Comeau said. 

       "In that respect, of course, we will have to be helped by outside
       people and, at times, like the RCMP does in 

       Ottawa, by hackers who are converted." 

       Comeau said reformed hackers are referred to as "white
       hackers" by the people who now hire them to protect systems. 

       A 24-year-old former hacker, interviewed by The Gazette last
       week, now protects an international computer network based in
       Montreal. 

       When he was 15, he was able to infiltrate Russian research
       computers - until he was caught and agreed to lecture RCMP
       staff on how hackers crack government systems to get
       information. 

       Comeau said someone tried for hours to hack into the
       commission's network two years ago, on a Saturday afternoon. 

       He said the demand for the extra protection has come not from
       the larger government ministries and organizations, but from
       smaller ones that are now trying to modernize and join
       established computer networks. 

       Another objective of the laboratory is to advise government
       services on what types of equipment to buy. 

       Even simple things like fax machines should be considered with
       security in mind, Comeau said. 

       He said the committee is advising government services against
       sending personal information via faxes, except in exceptional
       circumstances and after taking precautionary steps. 

       "We hope that in the coming year, 

       we will be able to advise hospitals and social institutions to do
       their own evaluation of their systems," he said, adding that a lot
       of money is about 

       to be invested in new information systems. 

       The laboratory will also examine the safety of equipment used
       for sharing data among institutions like hospitals and municipal
       administrations, which keep information that falls under privacy
       laws.

 13.0  News from Tokyo 
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Contributed by Wile, source: Associated Press (c) 1999 AP
       
       TOKYO (AP)  At a secret location somewhere in Tokyo, dozens
    áá of specialists in cryptography and electronic media will soon be
     á hard at work patrolling cyberspace.
    
    áá Due to open by July, the new headquarters for the National Police
    áá Agency's ``cyber-cop'' squad signals growing concern about
    áá computer security as more and more Japanese join the global
    áá online revolution.
    
    áá And while unauthorized computer snooping in Japan is less
    áá common than in the United States, a sharp jump in
    áá computer-related crimes in recent years has rattled authorities.
    
    áá The increase is no surprise  legally, Japan is a hacker's heaven.
    
    áá Breaking into a computer system isn't even a crime in Japan,
    áá which sets it apart from most other major industrialized nations.
    áá Hackers are free to peep at sensitive data stored in Japanese
    áá mainframes so long as they don't destroy or sell any of it.
    
    áá ``We have fallen behind other countries in this area,'' said Kei
    áá Hata, a member of Parliament who serves as deputy head of the
    áá ruling party's Internet policy committee. ``It's a problem which
    áá must be addressed quickly.''
    
    áá Worry about the potential for computer-generated chaos has
    áá prompted Tokyo to draft legislation to outlaw unauthorized
    áá access. A bill is expected to be submitted in the current session of
    áá Parliament, which ends in June.
    
    áá The move comes amid pressure from Washington to bolster
    áá international efforts to fight crime in cyberspace and dismay in
    áá Japan over abuses such as the widespread transmission of child
    áá pornography and even poison sales via suicide-related Websites.
    
    áá The problem is still relatively new to Japan.
    
    áá In 1997, the number of high-tech crimes known to Japanese police
    áá climbed to 263, up from 178 the previous year and just 32 in
    áá 1993.
    
    áá Still, a recent NPA survey showed that only 4 percent of
    áá companies and colleges polled reported cases of unauthorized
    áá access serious enough to inflict damage on their computer
    áá systems.
    
    áá By comparison, the San Francisco-based Computer Security
    áá Institute and the FBI found that 64 percent of 520 U.S.
    áá corporations, government agencies, financial institutions and
    áá universities responding to a 1998 survey had at least one
    áá computer security violation within the previous 12 months. More
    áá than 70 percent suffered financial losses.
    
    áá Japanese police suspect the true number of computer crimes is
    áá much higher than the official figure, and note that many
    áá businesses keep security problems under wraps to avoid negative
    áá publicity.
    
    áá Companies are particularly reluctant to disclose entanglements
    áá with organized crime syndicates, known as the yakuza.
    
    áá ``The yakuza have moved into this field,'' said Shunichi Kawabe,
    áá an official in the NPA's information technology bureau. ``They are
    áá very interested in making money in this type of business.''
    
    áá He said Internet-brokered gun trafficking, Web page-based
    áá pornography distribution and computer-generated financial fraud
    áá are among the areas suspected of being targeted.
    
     á Thrill-seekers are also stirring up trouble.
    
    áá One hacker broke into a computer network used by the Hokkaido
    áá University of Education in northern Japan and gained access to
    áá login IDs and passwords used by about 1,000 employees and
    áá students. The university uncovered the security breach last
    áá month and shut down the entire network.
    
    áá Japan plans to step up computer training programs for police, but
    áá authorities acknowledge they have a long way to go before
    áá catching up with their counterparts in the United States.
    
    áá The good news for the cops is that Japanese hackers also lag
    áá behind their cohorts overseas.
    
    áá ``Domestic cyber-criminals are still low-tech,'' said Kawabe.
