   "I got the teenage depression, thats all i'm talkin about, if you dunno
     what i mean then you better look out, look out!" 
                                      
                                            - Eddie & The Hotrods
     
   
   Synopsis
   --------     
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file: 

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them. 

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their 
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of 
    security holes and risks. 

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter. 

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list. 

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list: 

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present) 
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above 
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes 
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings 
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security 
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures 
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations 
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting 

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria. 

    Remember: YOYOW. 

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on this list and that reproduction of
    those words without your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be challenged by you, the author.

  00.4  Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.
     
     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you 
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost 
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff
     

   

  00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.
    
    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)
    
    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint 
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)      
             
    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)
    
    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??
             
   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's
    
    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)               
    
   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed
    
    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour &lt;sic> also wigger

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN &lt;g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R
            
   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me 
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'          
            
            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

      Army Signal Command protecting networks from hackers
      by Sgt. 1st Class Jim Ward
      
      FORT HUACHUCA, Ariz., (Army News Service, Feb. 11, 1999) -- Soldiers on
      patrol in countries spanning the globe are the sentries who keep enemies
      at bay. Even as they stand guard at the dawn of the new century, a system
      called information assurance is doing likewise -- with them in mind. 
      
      Information assurance is the umbrella term for what is a new way to ensure
      that the military's computer networks withstand withering attacks from
      foreign and domestic hackers. 
      
      Leading the charge in this effort is a team of computer networkers and
      specialists with the U.S.á Army Signal Command. This team has been working
      since March 1998 to accomplish a mission handed down from the highest
      levels of the defense leadership. 
      
      According to Lt. Col. James M. Withers, the head of the team, the team's
      charter is simple: devise a strategy that will keep critical networks as
      safe from intrusion as possible, and an action plan to help get there. 
      
      "Our mission, as outlined by the Army vice chief of staff is to implement
      near real time, worldwide, common picture of the Army's Military
      Information Environment," Withers said. 
      
      This was done by combining the Army's Information Service Provider
      functions with the Army Regional Computer Emergency Response Team. This,
      according to Withers, ensures that reporting of this common picture of
      this Military Information Environment to a central coordination center,
      located at Fort Huachuca. 
      
      "This action provided the Army Signal Command with an enhanced acquisition
      of unified and global near-real-time protect, detect and react
      capabilities through the lash-up of these two functions,"á Withers said. 
      
      Withers said that this process involves computer systems specialists from
      around the world. These personnel, in tandem with the Army Regional
      Computer Emergency Response Team, combine forces to detect hackers and
      others as soon as possible before damage can be done. 
      
      Computer systems specialists with the 1st Signal Brigade in Korea, the
      516th Signal Battalion in Hawaii and the 5th Signal Command in Germany
      operate and maintain Network and Systems Operations Centers. These
      soldiers and civilians are responsible for the detection effort in their
      theaters and report activity to the Army Signal Command headquarters. 
      
      Once at the ASC level, Army Network and Systems Operations Center staff
      performs over-watch on most of the Army's networks. This is an effort to
      keep the networks humming along, providing the information lifeline
      soldiers rely on as they perform their peace enforcement role around the
      world. 
      
      All of this, Withers said, is being done to ensure the Army's critical
      circuits and information systems don't fall prey to "cyberterrorists," who
      wish to do damage to the Army's ability to protect America. "The Army is
      in the lead in this battle thanks to the can-do attitude of the team that
      assembled here at ASC headquarters several months ago," Withers said. 
      
      
Now that the team has slammed the door on these terrorists and locked up
      the networks, the need for constant vigilance goes on. That's where the
      Regional Computer Emergency Response Team and its theater-level
      counterparts come in. 
      
      "Without the human element, this mission won't get done. The soldier is at
      the tip of the spear,"á Withers said. "Our team is a part of the process
      -- from fort to foxhole."

      Office at Fort Huachuca, Ariz.)

 03.1 The Key To Unlocking Data Access

      The Key To Unlocking Data Access
      By RUTRELL YASIN 
      
      Enterprises are finally doing something about their insecure intranets and
      extranets. Public-key infrastructure (PKI) technology--until now used
      mostly to secure Internet transactions in banking and other financial
      applications--is now reaching deep into corporate departments and everyday
      business applications. 
      
      Enterprises can no longer operate without a PKI safety net as they extend
      applications and data to partners and far-flung employees. 
      
      Companies are looking for their "return on investment with PKI to come
      from [securing] business-to-business and internal applications such as
      human resources systems," says John Pescatore, a senior consultant with
      PKI vendor Entrust Technologies Inc. 
      
      Leading the way are corporate titans such as Federal Express Corp.,
      NationsBank Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., all of which are piloting
      projects that could set the stage for internal PKI deployment for
      authentication, privacy and data integrity. 
      
      Federal Express is out in front. Fedex hopes to reap the benefits of PKI
      this spring as it rolls out a digital signature-enabled human resources
      system that gives the company's 141,000 employees secure access to their
      personnel files. 
      
      Fedex, which is using Entrust encryption-key management, secure e-mail and
      application development tools, worked closely with Entrust to migrate the
      mainframe-based HR systems to an intranet. 
      
      "When we first started with PKI, we found all the PKI vendors were
      following an Internet model, not an intranet model," says James Candler,
      Fedex's vice president of personnel systems and support.á Changes were
      required to plug PKI into an intranet environment in which users might use
      multiple workstations, he says. 
      
      With Internet transactions, the model is much simpler: a home user
      conducting a transaction with a bank can download a digital
      certificate--electronic signatures that verify a user's identity--to a PC,
      and the information is specific to that computer. 
      
      However, in a corporate setting such as Fedex, departmental and field
      users need access to desktop PCs in conference rooms and at kiosks.
      Single-system digital certificates are not enough. 
      
      As a result, Fedex "had to create roaming certificates" that could be
      downloaded to a PC from an LDAP-based corporate directory, Candler says. 
      
      Using an Entrust digital certificate password and hardware ID tokens that
      resemble credit cards, Fedex wants its managers to transmit employee
      performance appraisals over the intranet, for example, eliminating a lot
      of paperwork. 
      
      But at $65 apiece, the company didn't want to give every employee a secure
      ID token. "We created a level of trust in the HR system," so employees who
      don't need access to a higher level of information can log on with just a
      passphrase, Candler says. 
      
      One benefit is that the implementation of PKI encryption and digital
      certificates is letting Fedex employees perform tasks on the Web that they
      couldn't before, Candler notes. For example, employee salary reviews are
      now sent to a supervisor via an e-mail message that includes a URL address
      
linking directly to the appropriate HR site where the review is written.
      Then the supervisor can forward the information on to HR. 
      
      Candler thinks other companies will add Web extensions to their HR systems
      to give employees self-service access to benefit and retirement plans. 
      
      "I've talked to other CIOs, and they agree that this is exactly where
      their companies need to go,"á Candler says. "We're leading the market by
      about a year," he says. 
      
      But as organizations deploy PKI, product interoperability and certificate
      management have become problematic. 
      
      NationsBank, a unit of $6.5 billion Bank of America, has launched pilot
      projects to give employees access to personnel records, 401(k) and other
      benefits, says Sam Phillips, senior vice president of information security
      at the bank. 
      
      PKI is generating "a lot of excitement," Phillips says. However, "like
      most companies, we want to standardize on one e-mail package. We are a
      very large organization constantly in acquisition" mode, he says. If one
      division is using Lotus Notes and the other Microsoft Exchange, the
      question is how to make the packages work together so that an S/MIME
      security implementation works across both systems, he says. 
      
      Another obstacle is directory services, specifically ensuring
      interoperability between LDAP interfaces from Microsoft, Netscape and
      Novell, he says. 
      
      To overcome some of these interoperability problems, NationsBank is using
      VeriSign Inc.'s Onsite integrated platform as a primary Certificate
      Authority. VeriSign "gives us flexibility," Phillips says. Instead of
      NationsBank setting up the PKI infrastructure internally, "VeriSign offers
      a complete set of services. We can leverage what they're doing" to
      communicate with GTE CyberTrust or Netscape if customers choose
      certificates from those vendors, he says. 
      
      Even electronics giant Texas Instruments opted for VeriSign, scrapping
      plans to launch a homegrown PKI framework. 
      
      "We actually built our own PKI, which was fairly robust, but we wanted to
      concentrate on our core competency," says John Fraser, IT security manager
      at the $8.4 billion manufacturer. "To deploy PKI, you had to pull together
      the servers, desktops, clients, the whole ball of wax," Fraser says. 
      
      "We wanted to be in the position as the market changes to move to the next
      new solution in PKI without changing" the whole infrastructure, Fraser
      says. Because VeriSign is based on an open platform, off-the-shelf
      security products can be integrated into the framework, reducing costs. 
      
      TI will deploy PKI both for intranets and Internet apps, Fraser says. "But
      our plan is not to use VeriSign digital certificates for
      customer-to-business transactions--not like the banking model." 
      
      TI has launched a program to forge tighter links with suppliers and to
      extend its intranet to accommodate more self-service apps, he says. 
      
      As the company deployed PKI technology and digital certificates, the
      biggest hurdles were managing a certificate revocation list and key escrow
      for employees who forgot passwords, Fraser says. 
      
      VeriSign is attempting to solve that problem with OnSite Key Manager,
      which provides encrypted backup and recovery of end-user keys and digital
      
certificates used within a PKI. 
      
      For the past year, Entrust, VeriSign and other PKI vendors have been
      offering tools that make it easier to manage multiple certificates from
      different vendors as well as add, change and revoke certificates. 
      
      Securing access to enterprise resource planning apps such as SAP is the
      next step for TI's PKI efforts, Fraser says. TI plans to deploy digital
      certificates for SAP's Internet Transaction Server, he says. 
      
      ERP applications weren't offering links to PKI a year ago, Fraser says.
      Now SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle realize their proprietary solutions have to
      be extended to acknowledge technologies such as Kerberos authentication
      and PKI. 
      
      Users are asking about PKI extensions to apps from PeopleSoft and SAP, as
      well as enterprise management platforms such as Computer Associates'
      Unicenter TNG and Tivoli Systems Inc.'s TME, Pescatore says. 
      
      Management platforms are the likely places to add hooks for security
      modules. "The same platform that is used for managing resources also can
      be used to manage people using digital certificates. This way, VPNs,
      switches and routers all can be tied in with PKI," he says. 
      
      The government of Ontario, Canada, has several pilot projects with Entrust
      that should bear fruit this year, says Scott Campbell, assistant deputy
      minister there. The government is issuing digital certificates to social
      workers at the 50 Children's Aide Societies across the province to ensure
      privacy. The certificates will let case workers securely access a central
      database to keep track of child abuse cases. 
      
      The database is updated regularly, so workers can keep better tabs on
      abused children if they move from Toronto, for example, to Ottawa,
      Campbell says. Prior to the pilot, it could take months for workers to
      track down the whereabouts of a child. 
      
      Ontario also uses PKI to secure e-mail for the 6,000-person Ontario
      Provincial Police force. A third pilot will help the 300-person IT group
      determine if there are any holes in the technology, he says. 
      
      As users deploy PKI pilots, they may find the real challenge is defining
      policies that link the technology with business processes, says Spiros
      Angelopoulos, a group manager with Raytheon at the NASA Ames Research
      Center. 
      
      "The tools are there, but [companies must define] policies on how to
      implement the tools," he says.á For example, with digital certificates,
      companies need to establish a policy for user eligibility and how users
      will receive their credentials, he says. 
      
      NASA Ames, which has 11 research centers across the nation, is using PKI
      for secure e-mail. The center is moving toward the day when "every person
      [at the center] will have a digital certificate,"á Angelopoulos says. 
      
      As PKI products continue to mature and pilots move into production this
      year, IT managers anticipate a surge in PKI deployments. Says TI's Fraser:
      "There's more than a [growing] interest in PKI; there's a lot of pent-up
      demand."

      Remember streakers? Those nutty nudes of the seventies who darted across

      I was always too uptight to join their au naturel jaunts.á Now, more than
      20 years later, every Netizen risks total exposure. Of email messages. Of
      medical records. Of places surfed. 
      
      I still don't want to bare all. While most Internet businesses work hard
      to protect your privacy, human screw-ups still happen. That's why these
      recent headlines worry me: 
      
      Patient Records on Web: Patient records -- containing names, phone and

      FRANCE BREAKS RANKS WITH USA & AGAINST USA ON CODES
      
      By far the most significant intelligence and security news of
      the fortnight is French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's 19
      January announcement that France is suddenly reversing its
      long-term and traditionally restrictive policy toward the
      public use of encryption systems and allowing complete freedom
      of use of systems with key lengths up to and including 128
      bits.á Currently, only 40 bit keys are legal and they must be
      deposited with a trusted third party ... of which there is only
      one recognized in all of France.á Under today's French law, the
      government has a right to understand any type of communication
      using public facilities, meaning post, telecommunications,
      semaphores, or what have you, although this law is seldom
      invoked publicly.
      
      The implication of this French decision goes far beyond France
      itself and is the first splash of a tidal change that will, in
      all likelihood, drown the international public encryption
      policy the US is trying to impose on the world in the name of
      fighting crime, drugs and terrorism.á France, which has
      probably suffered more deaths in the past few years from
      foreign terrorists than any other developed nation, "heard the
      players, questioned the experts and consulted its international
      partners" and explicitly decided that American high-tech
      eavesdropping and economic espionage is more detrimental to
      French interests than terrorists using encrypted
      communications.á The American menace is easily discernable in
      the opening lines of Mr. Jospin's statement concerning this
      tidal change in encryption policy:á "With the development of
      electronic espionage instruments, cryptography appears as an
      essential instrument of privacy protection."á No mention of
      crime, drugs or terrorists.
      
      Since the EU has already imposed much stronger privacy
      protection laws than the US, has debated the threat posed by
      the NSA Echelon worldwide telecommunications surveillance
      system, and has resisted "falling in line behind the FBI" on
      public eavesdropping, experts expect all EU countries to
      announce similar public encryption liberalization in the near
      future.á Indeed, this seems to be the developing EU strategy of
      letting the "uppity, snobbish Gallic French stand up to the
      Americans", something the French have always done with pride.
      Then, "once the rampart is breached", suddenly the other EU
      countries follow suit in a movement that could only have been
      negotiated and organized beforehand.á Specialists know it's
      coming on drug policies, but very few anticipated that a French
      Socialist government would stand up so unexpectedly to French
      security and intelligence services (which imposed the 40 bit
      key limit, a record lower limit in Western countries) and to
      the US.á Now it's done, the floodgates are open and watch
      what's going to happen ...á (...cut...)

      that might be left over from your workaday meagre existance and ponder 
      the wisdom in the words, don't go off half-cocked coz it mentions gh0d 
      either the message is deep some of you will not get it, I think that I do,
      since my IQ is in the 150+ range but some of you dumbasses out there may
      have trouble with it &lt;sarcasm> anyways read on and enjoy but keep your 
      flames to yourself, thanks phiregod for another really cool piece,

      how many times do i have to walk down these halls humming 'in the name 
      of love' and searching my soul for the ability to accept myself and 
      
others for who and what we are before i know what it is that i'm 
      supposed to be doing with my life?
      
      how many times do i have to recite the lord's prayer before i feel the 
      peace i see etched in so many a worshipers' face, when will i know there 
      is a god and that will bring me what i see fulfilled in the heart of 
      everyone i pass on the streets?
      
      how many times do i have to cry for the world before a single tear is 
      shed on my behalf, why do i have to be the savior of my own soul when i 
      see so many that are in the hands of their own personal messiah?
      
      why do i have to be the one that bleeds?
      why am i the one that suffers the sins of the children?
      why do i not see a divine power?
      
      slowly but surely i see my ability to speak being taken away, first a 
      number on a pentium processor, then a barcode tattooed on my neck. 
      history is in words, life is in words, love is in words.
      
      i hunted my quarry and i held its beating heart in my hands before i 
      drank it's warm blood, i will not let this be taken from me. without 
      freedom my soul is but another caged bird that sings it's sorrow from 
      plastic perch. i will not exsist without my voice, the shred of sanity 
      that comforts me in the complacent warmth of my so called education.
      
      i'm in a battle field with no weapon to vanquish the mighty empires 
      except the reason i present without showing my face. like a single 
      scream of a victim in the night i want my words to evoke primal fear in 
      the expression of those that hear it. 
      
      this is the time that we must use our words not our fists, this is when 
      we win with our knowledge and skill rather then with hatred and money. 
      this is the point in time that we drop our swords and reveal our wrists 
      to be cut for it is the only way that we can show that we are not 
      afraid. this is where the world realizes its sins against its children.
      
      i'm failing english even tho i finally understand it's use. i'm slipping 
      out of irc when i finally found what it is i want to say. i'm 
      disappearing from my friend's eyes even tho i understand what it is that 
      they want to see. i'm feeling the grim reaper's breath on my neck even 
      tho its not me that he wants.
      
      this rant is over, my voice is weak, and my spirit is worn. i dont want 
      another promise or another wish, i want to wake up and know that i dont 
      have to defend my views, that people understand evil in all of it's 
      forms. i want to yell at the top of my lungs and know that everyone who 
      can hear me will. i dont want to see any more imprisioned for the very 
      things we should praise.
      
      dont sell out.

 06.0 ISP cracks User's machine then threatens legal action on THEM

     Service & Reliability February 99: Hard drive hacked -- by ISP

     Roulla Yiacoumi (c) 1999

     When APC's Service & Reliability column received a phone call from an Internet
     user claiming his hard drive had been hacked into by his ISP, we had reservations.
     After all, this was something we had heard many times before, but had never seen
     proven.

     What made this time different, however, was that the user claimed he had received a letter from his provider explaining how it had
     committed the deed. Of course we were interested, but we still had no proof. So we asked the reader to forward the letter to us. 

     To our utter surprise, there were the words, in black and white. In an email addressed to the user, the provider wrote: "For your
     information, our network administrator, with very little effort, was able to violate your computer's security and examine the contents of
     your hard drive in only a few minutes." 

     We read it and re-read it. Surely no ISP would actually admit it had hacked a user's hard drive? 

     The name of this ISP? Internet Information Superhighway (IIS). Regular readers will recall that IIS was also the subject of a Service &
     Reliability column in March 1998 (see here), when a reader claimed he had been disconnected from the service after complaining
     about a fee increase. 

     So, what horrible offence had this user committed that IIS felt it was within its power to violate the user's hard drive? He had installed
     an option from the Windows 98 CD called 'HTTP Server' (part of 'Personal Web Server'), believing it was some kind of Web site
     creation tool. When he discovered it wasn't what he thought it was, he left it sitting on his hard drive until he received the
     heavy-handed letter from IIS which claimed it had "detected" the program on his machine, demanding it be immediately removed.
     Further, the provider had the gall to tell the reader that "operating such a service without the appropriate sanctions by the authorities
     offends State and Federal legislation, not to mention breaching our usage policy under our terms and conditions." 

     Now, we do not dispute that installing this program may have breached the ISP's terms and conditions. Indeed, it is in every user's
     best interests to read the online agreement before signing up with any provider and to make sure they understand what they can and
     can't do. However, to claim having this program offends state and federal legislation is ludicrous. There are no laws requiring users
     to seek approval before running a Web service. Indeed, when we asked IIS to clarify what it meant by these statements, we received
     a nasty legal letter -- but no answers. 

     The user told us he had contacted the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) and the NSW Commercial Crime Agency.
     We contacted both of these bodies to see what they had to say about this incident. 

     The TIO said that it had received this complaint and confirmed the matter had been referred to the NSW Police's Commercial Crime
     Agency. 

     We contacted the NSW Police and spoke to the Computer Crime Investigations Unit. A spokesperson confirmed the matter had
     been referred to them and had been investigated. Although no further action was taken against this ISP, the police have informed
     Service & Reliability that they would consider taking action against any ISP that acted with malicious intent, or without authority or
     lawful excuse in accessing data stored on a computer. 

     And, of course, we attempted to contact the ISP. As we had previously dealt with this ISP, we sent email to the three addresses we
     had on our books, but all three came back a day later saying they could not be delivered. 

     APC's daily news service Newswire (http://newswire.com.au/) published the story 'ISP busted for hacking' in November 1998 (see
     here). At the time of posting the story on its site, Newswire wrote that it was unable to contact IIS for comment. 

     When we later decided to run this story as part of Service & Reliability in the magazine, we again attempted to contact the ISP -- this
     time by fax. We sent a letter and a copy of the Newswire article, inviting the ISP to give its side of the story. We informed the
     provider that if it wished to respond via Australian Consolidated Press' lawyers, it was welcome to do so. (Australian Personal
     Computer is published by Australian Consolidated Press.) We requested a written response be forthcoming within one week. 

     Shortly before this deadline expired, our legal team received a written response from the provider's lawyer. It stated that "Newswire
     was not unable to contact my client as alleged" (false), that the NSW Commercial Crime Agency had not conducted an
     "investigation" into its client (we only stated that the police had investigated the matter), and that the user was "publishing
     pornographic material over the Internet using my client's service" -- a claim both the user and police instantly dismissed. 

     Further, the police added that the viewing and downloading of adult material over the Internet was not illegal (with the exception of
     child pornography, which was not an issue in this case). If the ISP suspected illegal activity on the part of a user, it is obligated to
     contact the police and not take matters into its own hands. 

     The ISP's lawyer demanded a retraction, claiming Newswire's article was "biased, distorted and malicious". It further accused the
     author of the article (yours truly) of being "involved in a conspiracy to falsely accuse my client of a crime", adding that this in itself is a
     crime "punishable by penal servitude for fourteen years". 

     Service & Reliability is a consumer column which seeks to address issues our readers have with hardware and software vendors,
     ISPs and related businesses. To present both sides of an issue, the vendor is invited and encouraged to respond to the reader's
     letter -- both the complaint and response are then published. If a vendor does not wish to submit a response, we will publish the
     complaint without it. 

     We do not succumb to the threat of legal proceedings -- regardless of who the vendor is. Our readers trust APC for its unbiased
     reporting and thoroughly investigated issues.

 07.0 The l0pht releases new NT advisory
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
                          L0pht Security Advisory

   
           Release date: February 18, 1999
            Application: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
               Severity: any local user can gain administator privileges
                         and/or take full control over the system
                  
                 Author: dildog@l0pht.com
                    URL: http://www.L0pht.com/advisories.html

      ---
      Overview :
      ---
      
              Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 implements a system-wide cache of
      file-mapping objects for the purpose of loading system dynamic link
      libraries (DLLs) as quickly as possible. These cache objects, located in
      the system's internal object namespace, are created with permissions such
      that the 'Everyone' group has full control over them. Hence, it is
      possible to delete these cache objects and replace them with others that
      point to different DLLs. 
      
              When processes are created, the loader maps/loads the loading
      executable's imported DLLs into the process space. If there is a DLL cache
      object available, it is simply mapped into the process space, rather than
      going to the disk. Hence, there is an exploitable condition, when a
      low-privilege user replaces a DLL in the cache with a trojan DLL, followed
      by a high-privelege account launching a process. The high priveleged
      process will map in the trojan DLL and execute code on behalf of the low
      privelege use r. 
      
      --- 
      Affected systems:
      ---
      
              Windows NT 4.0 Server SP4
              Windows NT 4.0 Workstation SP4
              Other service packs are likely to be vulnerable, but the exploit has
              not been tested on them, neither has the fix presented below.
      
      ---
      Description :
      ---
      
              The Windows NT object namespace is the place where the kernel
      keeps the names of mutexes, semaphores, filemapping objects, and other
      kernel objects. It is organized hierarchically, like a directory
      structure. Amongst the directories are: 
              
              \Device
              \BaseNamedObjects
              \Driver
              \KnownDlls
              ...
              
              The NT object namespace is browsable with a tool called 'WinObj
      2.0' from System Internals (their website is http://www.sysinternals.com).
      You may wish to look around this namespace and browse the default
      permissions of objects. It is quiet entertaining, really.
      
              The "\Knowndlls" directory contains a list of DLLs in the
      c:\winnt\system32 directory, like: 
      
              \KnownDlls\COMCTL32.dll
              \KnownDlls\MPR.dll
              \KnownDlls\advapi32.dll
              \KnownDlls\kernel32.dll
              ..
      
              All of these objects are created at boot time, and are 'permanent
      shared objects'. Normally, users can not create permanent shared objects
      (it's an advanced user right, and it is normally not assigned to any
      group, even Administrators). But the system pr eloads this cache for you.
      Permanent shared objects differ from regular shared objects only in the
      fact that they have a flag set, and an incremented reference count, such
      that if you create one, and then terminate the creating process or close
      all handle s to the object, it does not disappear from the object space. 
      
              To exploit the poor permissions on this cache, one first needs to
      delete one of the shared objects by name, in order to later replace it. So
      we make a call to the NTDLL.DLL native function "OpenSection()", getting a
      handle to the object. Then we call the
      
       NTOSKRNL.EXE native function "ZwMakeTemporaryObject()" which removes the
      'permanent' flag and decrements the reference counter from the object. Now
      we just call NTDLL.DLL:NtClose() on the handle and it is destroyed. 
      
              To create a section, one calls NTDLL.DLL:CreateSection(), which is
      undocumented. There are other calls one needs to make in order to set up
      the object and open the KnownDlls directory, but they are trivial and will
      not be discussed here. Feel free to bro wse the source code presented at
      the end of this advisory to see what you need to do though. Anyway, you
      create a section (aka file-mapping) object that points to a trojan DLL. A
      good candidate for DLL trojan is KERNEL32.DLL, since it is loaded by
      pretty much every executable you're going to run.
       
              Note that any DLL cache objects you create as a user can not be
      'permanent', hence, when you log out, the cache object _will_ disappear.
      So how can we get a higher privelege process to run while we're logged in?
      There are many ways. We can wait for an 'A t' job to go off, or we can set
      up the DLL hack as an 'At' job that goes off when someone else is logged
      in. But more reliable is this: 
              
              When a new Windows NT subsystem is started, it creates a subsystem
      process to handle various system details. Examples of these processes are
      LSASS.EXE and PSXSS.EXE. The PSXSS.EXE is the POSIX subsystem. But since
      no one ever really uses the POSIX subsys tem under NT. So, chances are, it
      won't be loaded into memory yet. Once it is, though, it's loaded until the
      machine reboots. If it loaded, reboot the machine, and it won't be :P. 
      
              So, we launch our DLL cache hack, and then run a POSIX subsystem
      command, thus launching PSXSS.EXE (which runs as 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM',
      the system account), and running our DLL with local administrator
      privileges. Incidentally, other subsystems have the
      
       same effect, such as the OS/2 subsystem (the only other one that probably
      isn't started yet). 
      
      --- 
      Workarounds/Fixes:
      ---
              
              I developed a patch for this security problem in the form of a
      Win32 Service program that can be installed by the Administrator of the
      system. It sets itself to run every time the system is started, and before
      the user has the opportunity to start a program, it adjusts the
      permissions of the DLL cache to something much safer. The source code for
      t his service is also provided, along with a compiled version. Links to
      the programs can be found at http://www.l0pht.com/advisories.html. 
      
              One can verify the validity of the patch by downloading the WinObj
      v2.0 tool from System Internals (www.sysinternals.com) and inspecting the
      permissions of the KnownDlls directory, and the section objects within it. 
      
              Microsoft has been sent a copy of this advisory, and I would
      expect a hotfix from them at some point in the near future. 
      
      ---
      Example :
      ---
      
              I wrote up a trojan to test exploitability, and it was a simple
      'forwarder' DLL that had the same exported names as KERNEL32.DLL, but a
      different 'DllMain()' function, to be called when the DLL is loaded. The
      function calls in my trojan, simply forward o ff to the real KERNEL32.DLL
      calls located in a copy of the kernel that you make in 'REALKERN.DLL' in
      the c:\temp directory. 
      
              To try out this vulnerability, obtain an account as a
      low-privilege guest user (referred to as 'Dick') and do the following: 
      
              1. Log in as Dick at the console.
              2. Start up two "cmd.exe" shells. Do the following in one of them.
              3. Copy c:\winnt\system32\kernel32.dll to c:\temp\realkern.dll
      (The egg dll is hard coded to use the c:\temp directory to find this file.
      If you can't put it in c:\temp, then modify the source '.def' file to
      point to a different location and recompile eggdll.dll)
              4. Copy the provided hackdll.exe and eggdll.dll to c:\temp
              5. Ensure that there is no file named c:\lockout. If there is,
      delete it. The exploit uses this file as a lockfile. 
              5. Delete the KERNEL32.DLL file-mapping object from the system cache:
                 c:\> cd\temp
                 c:\temp> hackdll -d kernel32.dll
              6. Insert the new file-mapping object with:
                 c:\temp> hackdll -a kernel32.dll c:\temp\eggdll.dll
                 Don't hit a key in this window after hitting enter.
              7. Now move to the other cmd.exe window that you started.
              8. Run a POSIX subsystem command. A good way to start it is:
                 c:\temp> posix /c calc
                 (if you have calculator installed. If not, pick some other program)
              9. Now the EGGDLL.DLL will prompt you with a few message boxes:
                 Say no to the "User is DOMAIN\DICK, Spawn Shell?" box.
                 Say no to the "User is \[garbage], Spawn Shell?" box.
                 Say YES to the "User is NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, Spawn Shell?" box.
                 Say YES to the "Winsta0" window station message box.
                 Say YES to the "Desktop" window desktop message box.
                 You will now see a "System Console" command.com shell open up.
                 (saying yes to the next 'winlogon' box will give you something
                  funny when you log out, btw :P)
              10. Now go back to your first cmd.exe window and hit a key to
                  unpoison the DLL cache.
              11. In the System Console window, run the User Manager program,
                  and modify Dick's account
                  (or anyone else's for that matter) to your hearts content.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
                          L0pht Security Advisory

                       Advisory released Jan. 21, 1999
           Application: Quakenbush Windows NT Password Appraiser

              Severity: Users of the tool Password Appraiser
                are unwittingly publishing NT user passwords to
            the internet (even if your company is behind a firewall).

      ---------
      Overview :
      ---------
      
        During an internal analysis of a tool which claimed to audit NT passwords
        we noticed said tool sends users password hashes to a remote system
        on the internet via HTTP. In addition to this, should the password
        be known to the remote server, the plaintext equivalent is sent back
        across the internet to the querying machine. What this means, in a nutshell,
        is that if you are in any sort of organization connected to the internet -
        behind a firewall or not* - and you run this program: You send all of 
        your users passwords out through the internet. (* as long as you are 
        permitting {users,employees} to surf the web) 
      
        This of course, makes the fact that you are trusting a third party with
        your password information in the first place, a smaller concern by
        comparison.
      
        Quakenbush is aware of this problem - yet there have been no statements 
        that this will ever be fixed or addressed from them.

        as a competitor to the L0pht's own L0phtCrack 2.51 tool. As such, we
        are going to do our best not to place any comparison on the two tools
        functionality, performace specs, etc. in this advisory as this is not a
        marketing blurb - but instead our regular service to the security 
        community. 
      
        In all good consciousness we could not keep it a secret that anyone who
        has run Password Appraiser has unwittingly exposed their private passwords. 
        We hope that various government agencies that are connected to the network 
        and run large NT installations were not bitten by this problem.
      
      ------------
      Description :
      ------------
      
        Password Appraiser is a tool that allows administrators to "Find accounts
        with weak passwords" [1] on NT systems. In actuality what it does is
        compare only the weaker LANMAN hash against a set of precomputed LANMAN
        hashes for a table lookup to see if the password is "weak".
      
        The Demo version *only* allows one to run the program via quering across
        the Internet. Other versions allow querying across the internet and/or
        a local dictionary containing a smaller subset of words/hashes.
      
        We were checking the program out locally in our labs and at the same time
        had taken a copy on an auditing gig of a large corporation ( >300,000 
        systems with huge NT domains and PDC's). We were interested in how this
        tool compared to L0phtcrack in real world situations.
      
        To see how the tool works we hooked up some network sniffers and
        ran the demo version on one of our test machines in our local labs. 
        Much to our surprise we watched the LANMAN hashes being sent IN THE CLEAR
        to pw.quakenbush.com. For the passwords that the server had in its
        dictionary a plaintext response was sent back. Our jaws dropped on the floor.
      
        A quick call to the l0pht member at the large corporation caught him
        just in time to prevent the running of the program on the corporations
        main PDC. A few seconds later and all >4000 users hashes (and any plaintext
        responses) would have been sent out, through the firewall, and across the
        internet.
      
        We know in the above situation that many of the users NT passwords were
        also the passwords that they chose for various remote access methods. This
        information could have been used to completely bypass the corporate firewall.
        
        So people realize that it is not just the plaintext responses that we are
        so concerned about - we captured some of the hashes that Password Appraiser
        could not crack and ran them through publicly available tools in brute 
        force mode to recover the passwords. 
      
        It is important to mention that user names are not sent across the wire.
        However, without the usernames the above threat is still quite real. The 
        problem lies the known quantities: the location/site that sent the 
        passwords, and the actual passwords.
      
        It is a trivial step to gather the usernames from this point forward. 
      
        [ Case examples: had the user accounts on our test machine been the 
         actual 7 members of the l0pht it would have been trivial to find our 
         e-mail names and try the passwords. With the large company, many of 
         the passwords were the same and though they would not have been 
         "cracked" by Password Appraiser, they were vulnerable to other tools
         performing NT password analysis. Determining valid usernames to try 
         with the recovered passwords is easily accomplished through enumeration
         on sites such as www.four11.com, and whois databases to name a few 
         resources.]

        [*] Note - the cid is the verification mechanism so the server can 
            austensibly check that the client is indeed paid for. The number that
            was removed was the evaluation number that was automatically sent
            upon downloading the software. Its value is unimportant for this

         From this, one can see that password appraiser only works on the deprecated
         LANMAN hash which is, in this case : D85774CF671A9947AAD3B435B51404EE
      
         The response shows that the password being checked was FOOBAR (case
         sensitivity is unknown as the program does not look at the NTLM hash).
      
         The above can be witnessed during any stage in transit to the quakenbush
         server. The attacker now has the password.

         Here, the LANMAN hash is : 8F4272A6FC6FDFDFAAD3B435B51404EE. We see from
         the response from Password Appraiser that it believes this password
         to be secure. Unfortunately, people sniffing the network who plug this
         hash into other tools take advantage of the weak design behind LANMAN [2]
         and retrieve the password of 'BOGUS!!' in under 1 minute.
      
      -----------
      Conclusion :
      -----------
      
        There are several good aspects to the Password Appraiser tool. 
        Unfortunately they appear to be in the non-security critical components. 
      
        The notion of sending such priveleged information [internal user 
        passwords and hashes] across the public networks is problematic. If
        there is no attempt at encryption then the attack is kindergarden level.
        If there is some sort of encrypted sleeve (ie an SSL session) then
        the attack is elevated a level but still possible as anyone can spoof
        as the server and harvest password hashes. Certificates would raise the
        bar even further but the problem of end-node security comes into play.
      
        One has to trust that the pw.quakenbush.com server is more secure than
        their corporate firewall or other protective measures. While in many 
        cases this might be true - there are undoubtedly cases where it is not.
        In these cases, since one has handed critical security information about 
        internal systems, the overal security is lowered due to the weakest link.
        
        The only way we saw to avoid this problem was to enable the end user to
        be completely self contained and not reliant upon external sources for
        cracking passwords.
      
        The moniker "Who has the keys to your business [3]" takes on an entire
        new light given the vulnerabilities in this advisory.

 07.2 Hackers Get Their Final Fantasy
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
     The hacker community didn't
     waste any time on tweaking
     modded systems to work with Square's new RPG.

     February 12, 1999 

     Within the time it takes to blink, restless hackers and code busters
     figured out how to bypass the Japanese version of Square's Final Fantasy
     VIII lockout mechanism, according to several sources that contacted
     IGNPSX today.

     Prior to today, owners of modified PlayStations who bought an imported
     Japanese version of FFVIII found that the tamper-sensitive game would
     not play on their systems, in an attempt to prevent exporters and other
     like-minded folk from playing it outside of Japan.

     However, within less than a day, Asian companies have found a solution
     to this apparently minor technical obstacle. A chip is available for
     PlayStations with older systems and newer systems, and National
     Console Support (www.ncsx.com) is retailing the chips for $78. These
     will be available by Monday, February 12, according to NCS.

     Another solution has also been found, this one for Gameshark owners.
     For those who own Game Shark v2.0, several variations of code are
     available.

     D009B182 0000
     8009B182 2402

     For use with any Magic Key or Pro Action Replay to boot FFVIII:

     D009B1B8 6D09
     8009B1B 8000

     Here's a variant of the code:

     D009B1B A002
     B009B1B A000

     For the record, IGNPSX does not in any way promote piracy of games
     or tampering of your system. After all, modding your PlayStation will
     void your warranty. We do, however, like to promote great games. For
     those of you able to purchase an import version of Final Fantasy VIII --
     and willing to forego one of the biggest aspects of the game, the story --
     then we do recommend purchasing the import version. Similarly, we also
     recommend waiting for the North American version when it arrives this
     fall -- the IGNPSX staff.

      It is possible to snoop a user's Linux connection through IRC..
      
      DCC Sending the device files /dev/ttyp1 - ? while someone is logged in on
      that ttyp to an outside client will send all information sent from that user
      to the target client, making it possible to snoop his connection, password
      and login
      
      The drawback is the user will not see his own information typed in and may
      disconnect, but for those with auto-login scripts, it is possible to recieve
      login/passwords, and even /dev/tty1 - etc. can be snooped for those logging
      in as root.. I would like some feedback on anyone who may have any ideas or

     I emailed Cyrix a few months ago, and even managed to get a "oh, we will
     look at it" thanks to Rafael Reilova, but that was it till today.á A
     couple of people did report it, effectively, froze (most of) their Cyrix
     CPUs while running the opcodes below as non priviledged user.
     
     While I don't have the enough knowledge to assure this _is_ a CPU bug, it
     certainly looks like one to me (NO_LOCK isn't a workaround, btw).

     Here is the code (tested with linux, any version):
     
     /* Please compile without optimizations */
     unsigned char the_data[] = { 62, 152, 13, 32, 224, 235, 230, 126, 247 };

     áá asm ("movl badboy,%eax");
     áá asm ("call *%eax");
     
     áá return 0;
     }
     
     If you try it, please send me your /proc/{cpuinfo,version} and if it
     freezes or not.

       Chipping Away at Your Privacy 
       News Opinion Contributed by Justin Hill

       An excerpt:
       
       "If having a retrievable serial number on your processor bugs you, then 
      you'll sleep better knowing that a lot of hackers and crackers on the 
      planet are going to be playing around with ways to prove just how easy it
      will be to steal your personal serial number without your knowledge -- 
      doh! But on the flip side, if it's even remotely possible, they'll attempt
      to make software that can spoof the processor serial number when it's 
      requested, so if your a privacy fanatic, you'll probably want to get a copy
      of that program if and when it appears - heh."
      
      Yes I think he's right ... and another short excerpt:

      "And if that's not a big enough dent to your already-almost-nonexistent-
      privacy, then you'll probably want to puke up your pizza when you learn that
      at least three states, South Carolina, Florida, and Colorado, have all made 
      a rather thoughtless deal with a private business firm so that the firm may 
      purchase some 22 million driver's license  photos of private state citizens.
      That's right people, your governors were clinically brain dead that day, and
      now your picture might fall into the hands of whoever calls the shots at that
      private company -- all this and more for only pennies a photo. But wait, it 
      gets even worse ;-]"

 11.0 Security Snake Oil
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
ááááááSnake Oil
      
      
      
      The problem with bad security is that it looks just like good security.
      You can't tell the difference by looking at the finished product.á Both
      make the same security claims; both have the same functionality.á Both
      might even use the same algorithms: triple-DES, 1024-bit RSA, etc.áá Both
      might use the same protocols, implement the same standards, and have been
      endorsed by the same industry groups.á Yet one is secure and the other is
      insecure.
      
      Many cryptographers have likened this situation to the pharmaceutical
      industry before regulation.á The parallels are many: vendors can make any
      claims they want, consumers don't have the expertise to judge the accuracy
      of those claims, and there's no real liability on the part of the vendors
      (read the license you agree to when you buy a software security product).
      
      This is not to say that there are no good cryptography products on the
      market. There are.á There are vendors that try to create good products and
      to be honest in their advertising.á And there are vendors that believe they
      have good products when they don't, but they're just not skilled enough to
      tell the difference.á And there are vendors that are just out to make a
      quick buck, and honestly don't care if their product is good or not.
      
      Most products seem to fall into the middle category: well-meaning but
      insecure.á I've talked about the reason in previous CRYPTO-GRAM essays, but
      I'll summarize: anyone can create a cryptography product that he himself
      cannot break.á This means that a well-meaning person comes up with a new
      idea, or at least an idea that he has never heard of, cannot break it, and
      believes that he just discovered the magic elixir to cure all security
      problems.á And even if there's no magic elixir, the difficulty of creating
      secure products combined with the ease of making mistakes makes bad
      cryptography the rule.
      
      The term we use for bad cryptography products is "snake oil," which was the
      turn-of-the-century American term for quack medicine.á It brings to mind
      traveling medicine shows, and hawkers selling their special magic elixir
      that would cure any ailment you could imagine.
      
      For example, here is a paragraph from the most recent snake-oil
      advertisement I received in e-mail: "Encryptor 4.0 uses a unique in-house
      developed incremental base shift algorithm.á Decryption is practically
      
impossible, even if someone manages to reverse engineer our program to
      obtain the algorithm, the decryption of a file depends on the exact
      password (encryption key).á Even if someone is guessing the encryption key
      the file will only be decrypted correctly if the encryption key is 100
      percent correct.á See the IMPORTANT WARNING on our Web site
      
http://ten4.com/encryptor."á I checked the Web site; the odds that this
      product is any good are negligible.
      
      Elsewhere I've talked about building strong security products, using
      tried-and-true mathematics, and generally being conservative.á Here I want
      to talk about some of the common snake-oil warning signs, and how you can
      pre-judge products from their advertising claims.á These warning signs are
      not foolproof, but they're pretty good.
      
      Warning Sign #1: Pseudo-mathematical gobbledygook.á 
      
      In the quote above, notice the "unique in-house developed incremental base
      shift algorithm."á Does anyone have any idea what that means?á Are there
      any academic papers that discuss this concept?á Long noun chains don't
      automatically imply security.
      
      Meganet &lt;http://www.meganet.com> has a beauty on their Web site: "The base
      of VME is a Virtual Matrix, a matrix of binary values which is infinity in
      size in theory and therefore have no redundant value.á The data to be
      encrypted is compared to the data in the Virtual Matrix.á Once a match is
      found, a set of pointers that indicate how to navigate inside the Virtual
      Matrix is created.á That set of pointers (which is worthless unless
      pointing to the right Virtual Matrix) is then further encrypted in dozens
      other algorithms in different stages to create an avalanche effect. The
      result is an encrypted file that even if decrypted is completely
      meaningless since the decrypted data is not the actual data but rather a
      set of pointers.á Considering that each session of VME has a unique
      different Virtual Matrix and that the data pattern within the Virtual
      Matrix is completely random and non-redundant, there is no way to derive
      the data out of the pointer set."á This makes no sense, even to an expert.
      
      US Data Security &lt;http://www.usdsi.com> has another beauty: "From a
      mathematical point of view, the TTM algorithm is intuitively natural and
      less cumbersome to use than methods that are number-theory based."
      SuperKrypt &lt;http://www.superkrypt.com/> tries to impress with an acronym:
      "SuperKrypt products utilize the DNGT bulk encryption method," whatever
      that is.á And Cennoid &lt;http://www.cennoid.com> just doesn't understand what
      it's talking about: "Since key length and key structure vary and since the
      encryption engine does not use any mathematical algorithms, reverse
      engineering is impossible and guessing is not an option."
      
      The point here is that, like medicine, cryptography is a science.á It has a
      body of knowledge, and researchers are constantly improving that body of
      knowledge: designing new security methods, breaking existing security
      methods, building theoretical foundations, etc.á Someone who obviously does
      not speak the language of cryptography is not conversant with the
      literature, and is much less likely to have invented something good.á It's
      
as if your doctor started talking about "energy waves and healing
      vibrations."á You'd worry.
      
      Warning Sign #2: New mathematics.
      
      Every couple of years, some mathematician looks over at cryptography, says
      something like, "oh, that's easy," and proceeds to create an encryption
      algorithm out of whatever he has been working on.á Invariably it is lousy.á 
      
      Beware cryptography based on new paradigms or new areas of mathematics:
      chaos theory, neural networks, coding theory, zeta functions.á Cryptography
      is hard; the odds that someone without any experience in the field can
      revolutionize it are small.á And if someone does, let the academic
      community have a few years to understand it before buying products based on
      it.
      
      Warning Sign #3: Proprietary cryptography.
      
      I promise not to start another tirade about the problems of proprietary
      cryptography.á I just include it here as a warning sign.á So when a company
      like GenioUSA &lt;http://www.geniousa.com/genio/> refuses to divulge what
      algorithm they're using (they claim it's "world class secret key
      encryption," whatever that means), you should think twice before using
      their product (it's completely broken, by the way).
      
      Another company, Crypt-o-Text &lt;http://www.savard.com/crypt-o-text/>,
      promises a "complex proprietary encryption algorithm" and that "there is
      absolutely no way to determine what password was used by examining the
      encrypted text."á It was completely broken in an InfoWorld review.
      
      This kind of thing isn't exclusive to small companies.á Axent once tried to
      pass XOR off as a real encryption algorithm.á It wasn't until some peeked
      inside the compiled code that we discovered it.
      
      Any company that won't discuss its algorithms or protocols has something to
      hide.á There's no other possible reason.á (And don't let them tell you that
      it is patent-pending; as soon as they file the patent, they can discuss the
      technology.á If they're still working on the patent, tell them to come back
      after they can make their technology public.)
      
      Warning Sign #4: Extreme cluelessness.
      
      Some companies make such weird claims that it's obvious that they don't
      understand the field.á TriStrata says this about their encryption
      algorithm:á "Since TriStrata's encryption scheme is so simple and of such
      low computational complexity, the client portion can reside on a wide range
      of systems -- from a server to a portable PC."á Don't they realize that
      every encryption algorithm is small enough to fit on a portable PC, that
      DES and RSA and SHA can fit on an 8-bit smart card, and that you can
      implement some of the AES candidates in 17 clock cycles per byte or a few
      thousand gates?
      
      GenioUSA talks about why they don't use public-key cryptography in their
      product): "Public Key encryption is exactly that, you are not the only
      party involved in the generation, integrity, and security of all the
      keys/passwords used to encrypt your e-mail, documents, and files.á Public
      key encryption is great technology to use to exchange things with anyone
      you won't trust with your secret key(s) and/or can't exchange secret key(s)
      with.á We quote one sentence from a well known Web page, 'All known public
      
key cryptosystems, however, are subject to shortcut attacks and must
      therefore use keys ten or more times the lengths of those discussed here to
      achieve the an [sic] equivalent level of security.'"á So what?á This
      company just doesn't get it.
      
      Warning Sign #5: Ridiculous key lengths.
      
      Jaws Technology &lt;http://www.jawstech.com> boasts: "Thanks to the JAWS L5
      algorithm's statistically unbreakable 4096 bit key, the safety of your most
      valued data files is ensured."á Meganet takes the ridiculous a step further
      &lt;http://www.meganet.com>: "1 million bit symmetric keys -- The market
      offer's [sic] 40-160 bit only!!"
      
      Longer key lengths are better, but only up to a point.á AES will have
      128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key lengths.á This is far longer than needed
      for the foreseeable future.á In fact, we cannot even imagine a world where
      256-bit brute force searches are possible.á It requires some fundamental
      breakthroughs in physics and our understanding of the universe.á For
      public-key cryptography, 2048-bit keys have same sort of property; longer
      is meaningless.
      
      Think of this as a sub-example of Warning Sign #4: if the company doesn't
      understand keys, do you really want them to design your security product?
      
      Warning Sign #6: One-time pads.
      
      One-time pads don't make sense for mass-market encryption products.á They
      may work in pencil-and-paper spy scenarios, they may work on the
      U.S.-Russia teletype hotline, but they don't work for you.á Most companies
      that claim they have a one-time pad actually do not.á They have something
      they think is a one-time pad.á A true one-time pad is provably secure
      (against certain attacks), but is also unusable.
      
      Elementrix, now defunct, announced a one-time pad product a few years ago,
      and refused to recant when it was shown that it was no such thing.á Ciphile
      Software &lt;http://www.ciphile.com> just tries to pretend: "Original Absolute
      Privacy - Level3 is an automated pseudo one-time pad generator with very
      sophisticated and powerful augmenting features."á Whatever that means.
      
      More recently, TriStrata &lt;http://www.tristrata.com> jumped on the world's
      cryptography stage by announcing that they had a one-time pad.á Since then,
      they've been thoroughly trounced by anyone with a grain of cryptographic
      sense and have deleted the phrase from their Web site.á At least they've
      exhibited learning behavior.
      
      Ultimate Privacy &lt;http://www.ultimateprivacy.com> might actually use a
      one-time pad (although they claim to use Blowfish, too, which worries me):
      "The one time pad is a private key method of encryption, and requires the
      safe and secure distribution of the pad material, which serves as the key
      in our solution.á The security of the key distribution comes down to how
      secure you want to be -- for communicating point-to-point with one other
      person, we suggest a face-to-face hand-off of the pad material."á Remember
      that you need to hand off the same volume of bits as the message you want
      to send, otherwise you don't have a one-time pad anymore.
      
      Warning Sign #7: Unsubstantiated claims.
      
      Jaws Technologies says this about its new encryption technology: "This
      scientifically acclaimed encryption product is the world's strongest
      
commercially available software of its kind."á Acclaimed by who?á The Web
      site doesn't say.á World's strongest by what comparison?á Nothing.
      
      UBE98, at &lt;http://www.parkie.ndirect.co.uk/>, stands for "unbreakable
      encryption," or at least it did before someone took a day to break it.á Its
      Web site makes the same sort of ridiculous claims:á "One of the Strongest
      Encryptions available in the UK in a program that everyone will understand
      how to use!"á Wow.á SenCrypt &lt;http://www.ionmarketing.com/> is advertised
      to be "the most secure cryptographic algorithm known to mankind."á Double wow.
      
      Some companies claim "military-grade" security.á This is a meaningless
      term.á There's no such standard.á And at least in the U.S., military
      cryptography is not available for non-government purposes (although
      government contractors can get it for classified contracts).
      
      Other companies make claims about other algorithms that are "broken,"
      without giving details.á Or that public-key cryptography is useless.á Don't
      believe any of this stuff.á If the claim seems far-fetched, it probably is.
      If a company claims that their products have been reviewed by
      cryptographers, ask for names.á Ask for a copy of the review.á Counterpane
      Systems reviews many products, and our clients can give out the reviews if
      they choose.
      
      Warning Sign #8: Security proofs.
      
      There are two kinds of snake-oil proofs.á The first are real mathematical
      proofs that don't say anything about real security.á The second are fake
      proofs.á Meganet claims to have a proof that their VME algorithm is as
      secure as a one-time pad.á Their "proof" is to explain how a one-time pad
      works, add the magic spell "VME has the same phenomenon behavior patterns,
      hence proves to be equally strong and unbreakable as OTP," and then give
      the results of some statistical tests.á This is not a proof.á It isn't even
      close.
      
      More subtle are actual provably secure systems.á They do exist.á Last
      summer, IBM made a big press splash about their provably secure system,
      which they claimed would revolutionize the cryptography landscape.á (See
      &lt;http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-9809.html#cramer-shoup> for a
      discussion.)á Since then, the system has disappeared.á It's great research,
      but mathematical proofs have little to do with actual product security.
      
      Warning Sign #9: Cracking contests.
      
      I wrote about this at length last December:
      &lt;http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-9812.html#contests>.á For now,
      suffice it to say that cracking contests are no guarantee of security, and
      often mean that the designers don't understand what it means to show that a
      product is secure.
      
      Conclusion: Separating the Good from the Bad
      
      These snake-oil warning signs are neither necessary nor sufficient criteria
      for separating the good cryptography from the snake oil.á Just as there
      could be insecure products that don't trigger any of these nine warning
      signs, there could be secure products that look very much like snake oil.
      But most people don't have the time, patience, or expertise to perform the
      kind of analysis necessary to make an educated determination.á In the
      absence of a Food-and-Drug-Administration-like body to regulate
      
cryptography, the only thing a reasonable person can do is to use warning
      signs like these as guides.

      on questionable cryptographic products, and a good way to increase the

 11.1  U.S has new interim crypto legislature
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Contributed by Ed, from CryptoGram a newsletter for all things crypto

      The U.S. has new interim cryptography export regulations.á The Department
      of Commerce issued new interim regulations on encryption export controls on
      December 31, 1998.á Products with DES can now be freely exported.á (Of
      course, we all know that DES can be broken in 21 hours by a bunch of
      amateurs, and a lot faster by professionals.)á Products with any key length
      can be exported to insurance companies, medical end-users, and online
      merchants (only for buying and selling goods), under the current exception
      available for banks.á Corporations can export to their subsidiaries for
      "internal company proprietary use"; some of this extends to partners of
      American companies.á Some of the licensing requirements on export of key
      escrow/key recovery systems have been removed.á These new regulations,
      announced in September, are targeted towards large corporations.
      Restrictions on the exports of strong encryption used for private,
      non-commercial reasons is still strictly limited.á Comments on the rules
      are due March 1, 1998.á A copy of the rules is available at:
      
http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/bxa-regs-1298.html
      
      France reversed its long-standing position as being one of the most
      anti-cryptography countries in the world.á On January 19, Prime Minister
      Lionel Jospin announced the French government is relaxing its current
      restrictive policy on encryption.á Under the new policy, a key escrow
      system of "Trusted Third Parties" will no longer be required for domestic
      use, the 1996 law requiring TTPs will not be implemented, and users will be
      able to use up to 128-bit encryption without restrictions until a new law
      which
      eliminates all restrictions is enacted.á Rah rah.á The announcement is
      available in French at:
      
http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/PM/D190199.HTM

      In addition to adding a unique processor ID (see below) to its Pentium III
      chip, Intel is adding a hardware random number generator.á This is
      excellent news.á I know nothing about how it works (or even if it is any
      good), but using techniques such as Yarrow, we can take even a mediocre
      hardware random number generator and turn it into something that is good
      for cryptographic applications.
      
      There's a new Word-based virus named Caligula.á Caligula steals a
      user's PGP key ring and sends it to the creators' FTP site.á According
      to Network Associates (owners of PGP, having bought it in 1997), this
      doesn't compromise PGP security because the key ring file is useless
      without the passphrase.á This seems a bit optimistic; once the private key
      
ring is known, PGP's security level goes from unbreakable to that of a
      standard hashed passphrase.á And most people choose lousy passphrases.

      Sun's Scott McNealy announced that we all have no privacy anyway, and might
      as well get used to it.á All the more troubling, Sun is a member of the
      Online Privacy Alliance.á With an attitude like McNealy's, is it hard to
      believe that "an industry coalition that seeks to head off government
      regulation of online consumer privacy in favor of an industry
      self-regulation approach" has my best interests at heart?

      SECRET POWER is an excellent book about project Echelon, the NSA's secret
      program designed to eavesdrop on pretty much every piece of communication
      in the world.á The book isn't available in the U.S. (Amazon.com never heard
      of it, and I got my copy from a friend in New Zealand), but CovertAction
      Quarterly has an excellent article on the topic by the author:

 12.0  The Hacker Challenge by Qubik
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The Hacker Challenge

     By: Qubik (qubik@bikkel.com)
     originally posted on HNN in BufferOverflow.

     You have probably read about them and some of you may have
     even participated in one or two. Hacker challenges; where your
     asked to bypass the latest security measure implemented into
     technology which is already, prior to testing, dubbed as the latest in
     computer protection. But for what in return? Most challenges offer a
     reward of some sorts, a reward which is more often than not, a five
     or six figure with a dollar sign placed neatly at the beginning. 

     So just what is the deal with these challenges? What purpose do
     they really serve and are they just marketing ploys? 

     I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're an administrator of a
     small corporate network. It's not the most exciting of jobs, and you
     don't have time to keep up with the latest going ons in the security
     scene. Your network has been attacked a few times before, and
     you start to think about upgrading your security. So where do you
     start? 

     Where else would you start, but the internet? It's the worlds largest
     resource, and every good company dealing with network security, is
     bound to be on the internet somewhere. So you use a search
     engine or two and you come across a web site for a new state of
     the art firewall, who's manufacturers claim it resisted every hacker
     that attempted to hack it at a recent hacker convention. Your
     amazed, surely their high price tag is nothing for complete
     security!? 

     Only what if it is all a clever ploy, haven't you got to ask yourself
     just how many people actually tried to hack into that particular
     piece of software? Haven't you got to look into the reputation of the
     manufacturer? Of course you do! To be sure, you've got to ask for
     the cold hard facts, not the marketing babble! 

     There are serious flaws in many hacker challenges, not the least
     being that most 'real' hackers only hear about them after they've
     finished. This makes you wonder just who took part, and how they
     found out about it. 

     It's not uncommon for hackers and security analysts to earn wages
     in excess of six figures, and to earn such wages, you've got to be
     either very lucky, or very busy. So what's your guarantee that a
     hacker who actually knows what he is doing, actually took the time
     out to earn a, comparatively, small ten thousand? You have no
     guarantee at all, why on earth should he or she bother? 

     Next ask yourself whether real hackers would want to find all those
     bugs in that new technological innovation. Surely their only going to
     end up making their job, of hacking, harder by pointing them out? 

     However, A low level source code analysis of a piece of software or
     a close look at hardware by reputable third party security analysis
     company will delay product ship times and cost a lot more than
     setting up a hacker challenge. Not to mention that it has nowhere
     near the same marketing punch. Display your product at an
     upcoming convention and let people bang on it for a weekend and
     then claim "Product X survives Hacker Challenge." Makes a great
     press release. 

     It all seems rather corrupt, with companies hiding the truth and
     rubbing their hands at the millions they make. A ten thousand dollar
     reward seems rather pathetic, when your earning ten times that
     kind of money. Surely these companies know this, are they in fact
     attempting to social engineer the hackers or maybe worse their
     customers? 

     But it's not all like that, there are plenty of genuine challenges out
     there. Some have been set up to test software and, now more and
     more, hardware, others testing entire networks. For example,
     recently the Quebec government is enlisting the aid of hackers to
     test its networks and to research new ways of protecting those
     networks. 

     So what can we say about hacker challenges? Do they really prove
     how secure a product is? I don't think so, the fact that most aren't
     officially announced to the hacker public and that they are often
     deliberately misinterpret, doesn't give a good impression. But then,
     who should a company go to? It's not the easiest of tasks in the
     world, to announce such a challenge. 

     Hack at your own discretion, don't be afraid to take part in a hacker
     challenge, but don't take the word of the manufacturer, when they
     say it's secure, just because a few passers by a convention typed a
     few keys on a keyboard. There will always be flaws in hardware and
     software, it's up to us to the true hacker to find and fix them,
     whether we do it for the companies maketing campaign, or for
     personal gratification.

      Crappy Movies - Frequently Asked Questions 
        
      
      
      Why does MTV suck? 
      MTV sucks because they play crappy videos and they have stupid television
      shows which are harder to watch than the insipid movies they endorse. The
      only programing station worse than MTV is WB. I often wonder what is
      harder to watch: MTV's The Real Worl d and its cast of cretins or Moesha.
      That's probably because I watch too much TV to begin with. But that's
      another issue all together. 
      
      
      You guys seem pretty knoweldgable about what sucks and what doesn't, where
      can I talk to you guys to find out more? 
      irc.psychic.com It's cool there. Uhm, yeah. 
      
      
      Why did you guys hack the 200 Cigarettes web site? The movie isn't even
      out yet. 
      Because we know it will suck. MTV endorses it, thusly, it sucks. Courtney
      Love is in it, thusly, it will suck. Robert Deniro is not in it, thusly,
      it will suck. It's another Gen-Xish type movie that I find very insulting.
      What ever happened to quality movies about serial killers and mobsters
      blowing each other up? I don't give a shit about some crappy bar scene in
      some far away, imaginary candyland that Paramount created to make them
      millions of dollars off rich, suburban white kids with too much ti me and
      apparently too much money on their hands. 
      
      
      Who is that guy on MTV's Road Rules that wears the r00t hat? 
      No clue. But whoever he is he's not a very snappy dresser and he seems to
      have a little trouble in social situations. He also seems to have
      difficulties communicating effectively with the sista among them. I like
      how MTV always sticks in their token black person, or token asian person,
      or token gay person, to fill the show out so it's a little more P.C.. It's
      pretty cool how there's always some white person that likes to fight with
      the token black person all the while MTV capitalizes off of it. And,
      honestly, would you wear that r00t hat in public? If the answer is yes,
      please stop reading this, get up, go outside and lie down in the street
      until a car runs you over and your brains squirt out all over the road
      causing many accidents and traffic delays. Because you are a dork. 
      
      
      Where should I go to meet you guys again? 
      irc.psychic.com 
      
      
      Aren't you guys going to speak spanish and talk about Venezuela or some
      other opressed South American country? 
      Yes. Arriba la raza. Yo quiero Taco Bell. And free Venezuela or something. 
      
      
      Who else should we free? 
      Kevin Mitnick, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Truman. Oh wait, Truman got out at the
      end. Okay, scratch the Truman thing. I wonder how much Jim Carrey got paid
      for that movie. I'm sure it's too much. 
      
      
      Courtney Love is looking kinda skanky, how do you guys feel about her
      doing movies? 
      The People vs. Larry Flynt was good, with no thanks from her, if ya ask
      me. Courtney Love is not only a crappy actress, but she's a crappy
      singer/guitarist and her band sucks too. Kurt Kaboom wasn't as great as
      everyone thinks as well. Neither was Tupac now that we're on the subject
      of celebrities who have died from gunshot wounds. Stupid celebrities. 
      
      
      What other celebrities died of gunshot wounds? 
      I don't know. I think that guy who played Hogan on Hogan's heroes did. JFK
      did. Abraham Lincoln, does he count? Robert Kennedy. Biggie Smalls. The
      old bass player from Metallica had a bus fall on his head. That's kinda
      cool. Does he count? 
      
      
      Where again? 
      irc.psychic.com 
      
      
      Will you guys keep on hacking movie sites to tell us they suck? 
      Most likely. 


      You guys rock, can I have your autographs. 
      No. 
  
  
      Please go to irc.psychic.com and tell us how lame we are and that we're
      not as badass as we think.
