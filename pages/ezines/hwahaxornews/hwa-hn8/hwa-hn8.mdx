   * This issue is a bit of a mess and i've missed some important news i'm
     running behind and playing catchup with the move to a weekly release
     schedule, i'm trying the best I can bear with me as we try and get our shit
     together.

   Synopsis
   --------     
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

       Has it occurred to anybody that "AOL for Dummies" is an extremely
       redundant name for a book? 
                                      - unknown
       
           
     Wahoo, we now have a mail-drop, if you are outside of the U.S.A or 
    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.
    
    Send all goodies to:

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a 
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places 
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool 
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a 
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey dude being cool in 
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.
    	    
	    
	    
    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:
    
    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file: 

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them. 

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their 
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of 
    security holes and risks. 

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter. 

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list. 

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list: 

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present) 
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above 
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes 
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings 
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security 
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures 
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations 
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting 

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria. 

    Remember: YOYOW. 

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on this list and that reproduction of
    those words without your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be challenged by you, the author.

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.
     
     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you 
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost 
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.
    
    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)
    
    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint 
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)      
             
    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)
    
    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)               
    
   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me

    ++  CROATIAN TROJAN USER CAUGHT 
        by BHZ, Wednesday 24th Feb 1999 on 12:31 pm ; via help net security
        Another trojan user caught by the police. This time Croatian police caught young
        "hacker", who used NetBus and Back orifice to enter remote computers, and to delete
        some files. He was spreading trojan servers over ICQ. Well stupid thing to do, 
        cause HiNet, ISP in Croatia (strange but Croatia has only one major ISP), has been
        monitoring for 31337 port sweepers for couple of months. "Hacker" is juvenile, so 
        no prison sentence for him. Original article was posted in Croatian daily newspaper

      E-caveat emptor
      An eBay spokesman said he could not give any more details on the
      type of transactions involved, which agency had contacted the company,
      or why the statement had been delayed almost a month. The company
      did say the inquiry is unrelated to Microsoft's stepping up its scrutiny
      of
      pirated software trading on the service.

      eBay also also made the news for temporarily blocking an ad from
      EarthLink that it didn't think complied with the rules of personal
      online trading. By week's end, Earthlink agreed to play by the rules
      and its offer was restored.

      Elsewhere, Compaq temporarily suspended sales agreements with
      as many as ten companies, including Buy.com, Cyberian Outpost,
      and even its own Shopping.com. Analysts said Compaq is worried
      about losing control of the distribution channel. Microsoft too
      wrestled with the problem of managing resellers in relaunching its
      online store.

      For some, the challenge is simply keeping the Web site up and
      running. Charles Schwab's site for online investors crashed for
      about an hour an one half on Wednesday, a glitch the brokerage
      firm blamed on a "mainframe problem." Schwab is not the first
      e-trader to suffer during a boom in online trading.

      Undaunted, the highly anticipated Drugstore.com launched this week,
      and e-commerce giant Amazon.com--also backed by venture
      capitalist Kleiner Perkins--said it would buy a major stake. Both
      companies face stiff competition, both from e-tailers and brick-and-
      morter providers. Home Depot also said it expected to get into the
      online business later this year.

      Though e-commerce stocks are down between a third to
      one-half of the 52-week highs reached late last year, some
      analysts discern buying opportunities. One reason: the e-tailers
      are seen as acquisition targets.

      Marketing headaches
      Intel launched its long-awaited Pentium III chip, but continued to
      encounter marketing headaches caused by an ID feature meant to
      facilitate, of all things, e-commerce. Privacy advocates worry it
      could used for nefarious purposes. IBM, Dell, and Gateway said
      they will ship computers with a secure method of turning the feature
      off.

      At a developer's conference, Intel  claimed a speed record for
      desktop processors in demonstrating a chip that reached 1002
      Mhz. But much of the conference was devoted to plans for
      notebooks, including the company's "Geyserville" technology,
      which allows portables to operate at a lower power state when
      running on batteries.

      Phone home
      The Federal Communications Commission ruled that a call to an
      Internet service provider should be treated as long distance, but

      dial-up access. The ruling applies only to contracts between

      The FTC's case against Intel will boil down to motive, FTC director
      William Baer said in an interview. At a hearing set to start on March 9,
      the agency will try to prove that Intel unfairly withheld products and
      product plans from customers in good standing to force them to give
      up intellectual property claims against the chipmaker.

      As its federal antitrust trial recessed, Microsoft appeared down
      after a week in which manager Dan Rosen's testimony about a
      key meeting with Netscape was badly undermined and his assertions
      that the Microsoft didn't view Netscape as a threat were contradicted
      by email. Additionally, the judge hearing the case challenged senior
      vice president Joachim Kempin's assertion that consumers aren't
      likely to use the browser that comes with their personal computers,
      preferring instead to seek out another one.

      Nearly two years after would-be Internet registrar PGMedia
      accused Network Solutions of violating antitrust laws, the suit
      appears stalled over weighty legal issues and procedural hurdles
      raised by the government's recent attempts to privatize Internet
      administration. Bogging down the case is whether the government-
      appointed monopoly registrar for the most popular forms of
      Internet addresses can even be sued.

      aimed at music fans and another at children. The online music
      "destination" site, which bears the working title the "Buggles
      Project" and is scheduled to launch in June, involves the acquisition
      of Imagine Radio. The children's site, with the working title "Project

      to launch in September. The company will provide the new sites
      with at least $250 million in marketing support, executives said.

      Please mark your calendars for this DoD sponsored Intrusion Detection
      and Information Assurance conference and workshop. There will be no  
      charge for attendees, but even though it is free we will make sure it
      is a high-value two days. Please pass this one to people who would be
      interested.
      
      
      Oct 26 will be a vendor show and high quality talks by experts in the
      field. If you are interested in presenting, please send email to:
      shadow@nswc.navy.mil
      
      
      On Oct 27 we will have a workshop from 0800 - 1600. It is entitled
      "Where's the depth?". This will explore the "last mile" problem in
      implementing a defense in depth strategy focusing on issues related to  
      instrumenting and protecting desktop computer systems. Once an attacker  
      is inside a facility either by circumventing a firewall, using insider   
      access, or exploiting a backdoor there is little chance they will be    
      stopped or even detected. There are a number of approaches including    
      personal firewalls and host based intrusion detection systems. Even so,    
      we have a long way to go before our desktops are truly a sensor network,  
      or before we can actually protect these systems. Workshop topics will be  
      divided between pragmatic and research solutions and challenges. The      
      workshop is invitation only. There will be a limited number of observer   
      seats for funding agencies, but this is primarily for active participants.
      If you wish to particpate send a proposal describing what you can bring
      to the table to shadow@nswc.navy.mil
      
      
      There may also be a workshop for issues facing Information System
      Security Managers.
      
      Hope to see you there!

     febuary 28th 1999 is the end of personal privacy on the internet as we 
     know it. a false sense of freedom will envelope every person who buys a 
     new pentium III processor, for with this purchase we will no longer be 
     private citizens.
     
     
     anyone who uses this processor can and will be monitored by any 
     interested third party, for whatever reason. this unconsulted move by 
     the intel corporation toward the consumer is the first step towards a 
     world in which the individual will no longer exsist.
     
     
     we can not let this happen, by boycott or by ballot this encroachment 
     upon our values must not go unnoticed. the very words that the founders 
     of this nation fought for will soon be twisted into mottos reminiscent 
     of nightmares.
     
     
     war is peace
     freedom is slavery
     ignorance is strength
     
     
     spread the word of this flagrant violation against the citizens of the 
     free and imprisioned world. if this mistake is incorporated blindly into 
     our lives there will be no turning back, and there will be no way to 
     correct this horrible disregard for our personal lives.
     
     
     this another wrong that must be righted if not by laws then by the 
     people they are supposed to protect. i am not one who would like my 
     movements or the contents of my computer open to public view, and i'm 
     sure no one else does either so with this i leave you.

 03.1 Hackers Reportedly Seize British Military Satellite 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Contributed by FProphet via: webcrawler top headlines/reuters
      
      LONDON (Reuters) - Hackers have seized control of one of
     Britain's military communication satellites and issued blackmail
     threats, The Sunday Business newspaper reported.

     The newspaper, quoting security sources, said the intruders altered
     the course of one of Britain's four satellites that are used by
     defense planners and military forces around the world.

     The sources said the satellite's course was changed just over two
     weeks ago. The hackers then issued a blackmail threat, demanding
     money to stop interfering with the satellite.

     "This is a nightmare scenario," said one intelligence source. Military
     strategists said that if Britain were to come under nuclear attack,
     an aggressor would first interfere with military communications
     systems.

     "This is not just a case of computer nerds mucking about. This is
     very, very serious and the blackmail threat has made it even more
     serious," one security source said.

     Police said they would not comment as the investigation was at too
     sensitive a stage. The Ministry of Defense made no comment.

       Eftpos scam nets crafty expert a sizeable refund 
       By GARRY BARKER - TECHNOLOGY REPORTER 
       Contributed by Spikeman
          
          Somewhere on the run from police, a computer-smart criminal 
          is spending $100,000 stolen from the National Bank of 
          Australia through Eftpos terminals.
          The fraud, part of a complex scam, was first discovered 
          late last year when bogus refunds on debit card purchases 
          began to appear, according to the bank's corporate 
          relations manager, Mr Hayden Park.
          On 4January, the bank withdrew refund facilities through 
          Eftpos terminals for debit cards.
          Further fraud, involving credit cards, appeared in January, 
          and on 12February all refund facilities through Eftpos terminals were
          withdrawn.
          ``The customer still gets the money back, but the refund 
          has to be done manually, not electronically through the 
          terminal,'' Mr Park said. ``We expect to have fixed the 
          problem - closed the door - and have automatic refunds back 
          on the terminals in six to eight weeks.''
          The fraud involved a small family business.
          How did they do it? ``In one case, the crooks pinched a 
          terminal; physically removed it. Then they linked it back 
          into the merchant's system, in effect hacked into his link 
          with the bank, and issued themselves with credits, paid to 
          a variety of real bank accounts in branches all over the place,'' Mr
          Park said.
          ``In a couple of other cases the merchant's terminal had 
          been tampered with. That may indicate a lack of security on 
          the part of the merchant. Or maybe he was in cahoots with 
          the crooks, but we don't think so.
          ``So we know who got the money or, at least, the identity 
          of the person for whom the bank account was established. 
          But when we go to that account, there's no money in it.
          ``We tell the police, but when they go to the address we 
          have recorded, there's no one there.''
          Obviously, he said, the criminals were computer literate, 
          and prepared to take risks.
          ``You always have to keep upgrading your security, whether 
          it is for cheques, robberies or electronic fraud,'' Mr Park 
          said. ``We'll fix this problem, restore the refund facility 
          on our Eftpos terminals, and wait for the next crook to try something.''
          Automatic teller machines have also been targets for 
          criminals. In Melbourne some years ago criminals used a 
          frontend loader or a bulldozer to wrench an automatic 
          teller machine out of a bank wall and made off with it. But 
          one of the neatest ``stings'' took place in the United 
          States recently. A criminal gang set up a phony automatic 
          teller machine in a big shopping mall. The machine would 
          not dispense cash, but readily accepted deposits with 
          which, at the end of a week, the criminals absconded.

 05.0 Copyrights on security advisories?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
      Subject:      OT: Copyright on Security advisories 
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org       
      
      
      I'm sorry for this off topic message, but I think others share my
      opinion on this.
      
      
      My message is directed mainly at H.E.R.T (Hacker Emergency Response
      Team) and at ISS Alert, but also to all bugtraq subscribers.
      I'm writing behalf of a small group of people, operating a security
      portal page (www.SecuriTeam.com), where we try to write about important
      security issues and security news. Our site is non-commercial and
      totally advetisement free, and we see it as a service to the security
      community (just like many other free services offered to the security
      community by others).
      Naturally, we don't discover all the security holes ourselves, and we
      rely heavily on mailing lists such as the Microsoft alert, ISS alert,
      CERT alert, bugtraq, NTBugtraq and other helpful mailing lists and web
      site that deal with security.
      
      
      The problem starts with advisories that contain:
      "Permission is granted to reproduce and distribute HERT advisories in
      their
      entirety, provided the HERT PGP signature is included and provided the
      alert is used for noncommercial purposes and
      with the intent of increasing the aware-
      ness of the Internet community"
      
      
      (this is taken from a HERT advisory. ISS have a similar policy).
      
      
      So what are my options (mine, and all the other folks who want to
      publish this information)? The way I see it, I can only do copy & paste
      of this information into an html page (including the PGP signature!!!),
      and put it on-line.
      I agree that this advisory has a very nice design to it, but it's way
      different from the design of our web pages. The content is also
      different. The target audience is different. These advisories are
      usually long, and very technical. Our articles are short, and less
      technical.
      
      
      On the bottom line, my options shrink to one: Wait until someone else
      publishes it, and paraphrase them. (now they're the "offenders").
      
      
      I don't want to take the credit away from the authors. Every article we
      publish contains explicit mentions of who found the bug, who reported
      the bug, who published the fix, etc. We don't want to take credit for
      things we didn't do, but we *do* want to provide good service to the
      people who come to our web site! And this good service cannot include
      "It is not to be edited in any way without express consent of X-Force"
      (taken from the ISS alert advisories). I can't wait to get ISS's
      permission for every exploit they find! Doing so will make the whole
      concept of "security news" pointless.
      
      
      I can only see two roads from here. The first road means the gradual
      disappearance of non-commercial security information centers. Security
      information will not be shared in forums such as bugtraq/ntbugtraq,
      security newsgroups and web sites. You'll have to pay security
      consultants to get information . (Actually, this doesn't sound that bad.
      It means we'll make a lot of money)
      The second road leads to totally free and open sharing of information.
      ISS and HERT: If this is what you would like to see when you look at the
      future, please loosen your restrictions from the security advisories you
      publish.
      
      
      I really want to emphasize one important point. We *really* don't want
      the credit. We believe that if a someone discovered a bug or exploit
      they should have all the credit they deserve (hell, they could name the
      bug after themselves if they wish. Am I right, Mr. Cuartango?). It seems
      to me, they get more recognition when information about their exploit
      spreads. But the actual text they wrote about the bug/exploit should not
      be the main issue here, and putting a copyright on the full text misses
      the point entirely.
      
      
      I apologize for boring to death some (most?) of you on this list, but I
      believe this is important enough to share with you, and I would really
      like to hear what you all have to say about this issue.

      Does anyone else think it is ironic that this book is part of a series on
      *open* information management?  No, I didn't think so. 
      
      
      Part one is an introduction to Intelink, the intranet connecting the
      thirteen various agencies involved in the US intelligence community.
      Chapter one is a very superficial overview of some basics: who are the
      departments, packet networks, layered protocols, and so forth.  The
      description of Intelink as a combination of groupware, data warehouse, and
      help desk, based on "commercial, off-the-shelf" (COTS) technology with
      Internet and Web protocols, in chapter two, should come as no big
      surprise. 
      
      
      Part two looks at the implementation (well, a rather high level design,
      anyway) of Intelink.  Chapter three reviews the various government
      standards used as reference materials for the system, which boil down to
      open (known) standards except for the secret stuff, for which we get
      acronyms.  There is a quick look at electronic intruders, encryption, and
      security policy in chapter four.  Various security practices used in the
      system are mentioned in chapter five, but even fairly innocuous details
      are lacking.  For example, "strong authentication" is discussed in terms
      of certificates and smartcards, but a challenge/response system that does
      not send passwords over the net, such as Kerberos, is not, except in the
      (coded?) word "token." Almost all of chapter six, describing tools and
      functions, will be immediately familiar to regular Internet users. 
      Chapter seven takes a return look at standards.  The case studies in
      chapter eight all seem to lean very heavily on SGML (Standard Generalized
      Markup Language)  for some reason. 
      
      
      Part three is editorial in nature.  Chapter nine stresses the importance
      of information.  (Its centerpiece, a look at statements from some of the
      Disney Fellows from the Imagineering division is somewhat paradoxically
      loose with the facts.)  The book closes with an analysis of intelligence
      service "agility," using technology as an answer to everything except
      interdepartmental rivalries. 
      
      
      Probably the most interesting aspect of the book is the existence of
      Intelink at all, and the fact that it uses COTS components and open
      standard protocols.  (Of course, since it was defence money that seeded
      the development of the Internet in the first place, one could see Intelink
      simply as a belated recognition of the usefulness of the product.)  For
      those into the details of the US government's more secretive services
      there is some mildly interesting information in the book.  For those
      charged with building secure intranets there is some good pep talk
      material, but little assistance.

 07.0 MCI Worldcom joins security force
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

      http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,32590,00.html
      MCI Worldcom joins security force
      By Tim Clark
      February 18, 1999, 12:35 p.m. PT
      
      
           Add MCI WorldCom to the parade of companies entering the security
      services and outsourcing market. 
      
      
           Knitting together pieces from its many acquisitions, MCI WorldCom's
      new security unit will compete with GTE Internetworking, Pilot Network
      Services, IBM, the Big Five accounting and consulting firms, and Lucent
      Technologies, which entered the security fray last week. 
      
      
           "We can bring together networking, security, and Internet hosting," 
      said Jason Comstock, general manager of the new security unit. The service
      includes offerings from CompuServe Network Services, ANS, UUNet, and
      GridNet, all WorldCom acquisitions. "We see security as a core offering
      for MCI WorldCom, especially security consulting." 
      
      
           As corporations move toward Internet commerce and sharing corporate
      information with partners on so-called extranets, network security has
      become a growing concern.  Even the largest corporations are having
      trouble hiring scarce talent in the field, so security outsourcing has
      boomed. 
      
      
           "When you look at security as an enabling technology that allows you
      to make money safely, then it starts to make sense to outsource," said Jim
      Balderston, security analyst at Zona Research. 
      
      
           Matthew Kovar, an industry analyst at the Yankee Group, likes MCI's
      move. "MCI WorldCom has made a great stride to catch up to the leader in
      this area, which has been GTE Internetworking," he said. 
      
      
           MCI WorldCom's new security service comes barely a week after the
      company's complex, $17 billion deal to sell its MCI Systemhouse computer
      services unit and 12,000 employees to Electronic Data Systems.
      
      
          The security services unit is far smaller than Systemhouse, with about
      170 people, a data center in Reston, Virginia, and a limited range of
      outsourcing options. 
      
      
          Housed within MCI WorldCom's Advanced Networks unit, the managed
      security services' menu includes outsourcing or installation of Virtual
      Private Networks (VPNs); firewalls; authentication services; security
      training; and security assessment. The SecureSweep service, which checks
      networks for holes intruders might exploit, is handled by independent
      contractors. 
      
      
          "Security outsourcing is a subset of the larger market moving toward
      application service providers, or ASPs,"  Balderston said. The ASP
      movement, which emerged last year, involves an ISP or other service
      provider hosting e-commerce, enterprise resource planning, or other
      applications for customers.
      
      
          Comstock said MCI WorldCom will add managed authentication, broader
      training programs, and partnerships with certificate authorities for using
      digital IDs for security on corporate networks or extranets. 
      
      
          In addition to offering managed security directly to multinational
      corporations worldwide, MCI WorldCom plans a "private label" version that
      resellers can market to smaller U.S.  companies and in Latin America.
      
      
          The service will use internally developed firewall software as well as
      products from Check Point Software, authentication servers and tokens from
      Security Dynamics and Secure Computing, and scanning tools from Internet
      Security Systems

 08.0 "15yr old sets up a new EFNet server"      
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From OPERLIST ... somewhat interesting I thought, perhaps not to all but we all
     started somewhere and everyone grows up. I recall running a BBS and having some
     "12yr old wannabe hacker" try breaking into the board or harassing me voice when
     I tried to verify one of his multiple accounts for tradewars, well that kid now
     works for IBM and me? well the board is long dead but the point is the same, we
     all go thru phases, some last longer than others, you can't judge someone by their
     age and we all grow up, some faster than others.. - Ed

     Ok, so this 15 year old kid aaronwl doesnt actually work for globalized (fake
     company) he just knows the owner of the domain/box and said 'hey lets start an
     efnet server'
     
     
     now my question is, is everyone aware that this server irc.globalized.net is
     actually linked to efnet with a 15 year old packet kiddie admin and what
     exactly is globalized, is it an isp? No. is an internet backbone? nope. aaron?
     what is this wonderful company that you dont work for and why does their
     webpage have about 3 words total, work with me baby?
     
     
     ill be sending in my efnet application shortly, im 14 and the server will be
     on my norweigan dialup but i once had tcm access on dalnet so i should be able
     to slide in

     What does his age have to do with anything?  I know several teens (both
     online and IRL) who are much more mature than some >30something people I
     know.
     
     
     Also, what, exactly, do you hope to accomplish by posting this to Oprahslust?
     
     
     Here are my questions for you:
     
     
     Did you know about application was pending before it was linked?
     
     
     -> If yes, did you bring your concerns to the routing secretary so that
     the voting routing admins could be made aware of them?
     
     
     -> If no, have you NOW brought your concerns to the routing secretary and
     Aaron's uplinks so that they can review and evaluate them?  There is a
     probationary period -- if your concerns are valid, and there are problems
     with the server, it shouldn't be a problem to have it removed at the end
     of probation.
     
     
     Posting to this list will accomplish nothing.  In fact, I doubt many of
     the voting routing admins are even on this list anymore.
     
     
     I had a few concerns about the globalized link as well.  I didn't bother
     to bring them to the routing secretary (I don't much care about EFnet
     politics anymore), so I'm not going to whine now that it's linked.  If
     someone screws up, or it's unreliable, it will be removed.

     whoo an operlist post about me and my aol account .. famous aaronwl =)
     
     
       I'm curious....  what exactly does Showmount@aol.com want from me?  Was
     there any kind of constructive change he was trying to suggest?
       Yes, I work for Globalized.
       No, as later posts bring up, I do not know everything about the complexities
     of BGP etc.  But lets take your standard ISP...
       Does every person in the company know how to operate every program and do
     every task that it is demanded that the company must do?  No, of course not.
     Every person has their own job to take care of.
       As administrator of the IRC server, I know how to keep it running at top
     preformance. I know how to fix problems if they arise (and they have, and they
     will).  And I know how to deal with the wonder DOS attacks that we keep
     getting.  And for everything I don't know, there is someone else who does.
       I'll do my best to run irc.globalized.net.  I'll admit, I'm not perfect, and
     I have my flaws.  I am *always* open to comments, suggestions, and
     constructive critism.  And I guess that is all I can do :)

  10.0  Next Up: 10-Gbps Ethernet
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19990224S0008
        (02/24/99, 10:43 a.m. ET)
        By Christine Zimmerman, Data Communications 

        With the bulk of the work on the Gigabit Ethernet standard done,
        engineers and  vendors already have their sights on higher speeds. 

        Tony Lee, product-line manager at Extreme Networks, in Cupertino,
        Calif., and chair of the Gigabit Ethernet Alliance, said the IEEE
        802 committee will begin to assess interest in 10-gigabit-per-second
        Ethernet on March 9. And based on what he's seen so far, Lee said he
        predicts a standard for fiber-based 10-Gbps Ethernet in the next 3yrs.
        
        "I know there are companies concept-proving the speed right now," he
         said. "There's nothing to prevent them from seeking 10 times the
         performance of Gigabit Ethernet." 

         He said he believes once 1,000-BaseT is in place, Gigabit Ethernet to
         the desktop will become a reality. As that occurs, network managers 
         will need more bandwidth in the backbone. 

         But there is at least one challenge. While engineers developing the
         physical layer of Fast Ethernet borrowed from FDDI, and those developing
         Gigabit Ethernet turned to Fibre Channel, there's really no physical-layer
         technology that will serve as a suitable base for 10-Gbps Ethernet.

   11.0  Thieves Trick Crackers Into Attacking Networks
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               
        (02/16/99, 12:10 p.m. ET)
        By Lee Kimber, Network Week 

        Corporate networks are coming under attack from an army of amateur crackers
        working unwittingly for professional thieves, security experts have warned. 

        They have identified signs that organized criminals and "professional" 
        crackers are using trick software that lets teenage enthusiasts -- known as
        "script kiddies" -- attack networks for amusement. The software then secretly
        sends the findings of these surveys to experienced crackers. 

        Professional gangs could use this trick to build massive databases of network
        insecurities for thieves to exploit. Consultants cited the hacking group New 
        Order's Aggressor network-attack software, which invites amateurs to register
        for a full copy on the promise that they will receive hidden tools to mount 
        stronger attacks on their victims. 
      
        "We could be looking at half a dozen teenagers doing cracking on behalf of
         New Order," warned Internet Security Systems security expert Kevin Black.
         "It's: 'Here's a toy to play with,' then: 'Thank you, soldier.' " The growth
         of Java programming skills lies behind another new trick, where crackers build
         Java cracking software into websites. When surfers browse the site, the program
         returns the surfer's IP address to network security tools' logs, leaving the 
         cracker's real location a secret. 

         Canadian hacking group HackCanada is encouraging crackers to rewrite the Python
         network-scanning script Phf in Java so it can be loaded into Web surfers'
         browsers during a visit to an innocuous-looking site. 

          HackCanada adopted the tactic after a cracker received a warning from a corporate
          network administrator who detected him using the Phf script in its native Python
          form. And in a gloomy warning for network administrators, Axent security consultant
          David Butler warned teenagers and students who collected cracking tools to impress
          their peers would quickly try them out. 

          "Cracking attempts rise by a factor or three or four during school holidays," 
          Butler told a joint Toshiba-Inflo  security presentation earlier this month. 

          The news came shortly after security experts learned the freely available 
          password authenticator Tcpwrapper had been rewritten and redistributed in a
          form that sends passwords it finds to an anonymous Hotmail address. 

          "It's a shift in the mentality of cracking," said Black. "It's the difference
          between the men and the boys." 
          
          "We have been under constant attack by hackers since Christmas," said Nokia
          Telecommunications' Europe, Middle East, and Africa marketing director Bob 
          Brace. The company had detected 24,000 cracking attempts since October last
          year, he said. 

           Nokia runs IP440 firewall and NAT with log  analysis, so Brace could see the
           hackers first tried to ping every IP address, then probed for specific ports
           such as the default ports for Back Orifice (31337 and 1234) and port 80. (Back
           Orifice lets crackers gain control of a remote PC and is often hidden as a trojan
           in games.) 

           "I believe much of the probing is automated and some of the more serious attacks 
           are spread out so they are  not easy to identify in a trace," Brace said.

   12.0 How Nokia Guards Against Crackers
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        (02/24/99, 10:34 a.m. ET)
        By Lee Kimber, Network Week 

        Faced with 24,000 attempted network attacks in the past six months, 
        Finnish telecommunications leader Nokia has developed a smart strategy
        to protect itself:
        
                 Follow the network security rule book to the
                 letter. 

        Marketing manager Bob Brace said the policy started at the ICMP level 
        -- by disallowing pings. 

        "The hackers first try do things like ping every IP address on a class C
        subnet," he said. "So they will try for x.x.x.1 to x.x.x.254. We do not 
        allow pings." 

        He said Nokia protected its networks with an integrated firewall/router 
        -- the IP1440 -- providing logs showing the attacks came from different 
        types of crackers -- amateurs that tried to scan ports sequentially and 
        professionals that carried out long-term port scanning from different IP
        addresses. The logs proved the crackers' attempts to find a service on 
        1234 -- the default port used by the remote-control Trojan  Back Orifice,
        Brace said. (erhm whups??? thats netbus ... - Ed) 
        
        The firewall also offered NAT, which could be configured to drop ICMP
        packets regardless of the packet filtering set up on the firewall. 

        That won the approval of Integralis security expert Tony Rowan: "If you've
        got NAT," he said, "you're almost there." He said the ICMP suite contained
        commands most people had forgotten -- unless they were crackers. 

        "Router redirect lets you make a router hand requests to someone else.
         This is an ICMP request, and you can get packet shapers that let you set
         these up," he said. When setting up a CheckPoint firewall for an Integralis
         customer, he recommended they turn on the "stealth rule" -- any packet from
         anywhere to the firewall is dropped, rather than rejected, which would give
         them feedback. Log it with a long log, he said. Nokia runs an internal U.K.
         Web server and a public Web server in Helsinki, and Brace said he saw port 80
         scans of the U.K. intranet all the time. 

         "Our intranet server here in the U.K. cannot be seen from the outside; 
         the IP440 keeps these hackers at arm's length. They can see we are here, but
         they don't know what is on the other side of the firewall." The last weapon 
         is encryption. Given Nokia's firewall logs have proved some of its attempted
         cracks are by extremely knowledgeable people, the company said remote-access
         services are the biggest vulnerability in its network. (gee whiz)

         Remote users dialed in using encrypted VPNs over the Internet, it said. Nokia
         then authenticated them again if they tried to access key resources. 

         So Brace had strong advice for governments (better listen up! &lt;sic>) that
         wanted to impose key escrow. "Key escrow weakens authentication and threatens 
         the whole issue of e-commerce," he said.

  13.0 BILL H.R 514 COULD BAN PERSONAL "ACTION" FREQUENCY MONITORING
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
      Well, they tried banning oral sex, they'd probably tax fucking and
      shitting if they could attach a meter to your cock or ass and now
      they are preventing the pleasurable experience of monitoring fun
      radio channels by introducing this bill. I'd personally like to roll
      the bill up into a tight wad and stuff it in various orifices of the
      people that thought this up and as an addendum to this i'd also like
      to say "why don't you just fuck off?" anyone in the know can modify
      or build a fucking scanner to bypass anything that they come up with
      they are just making it more difficult for people to do so. I am a
      licensed ham radio operator and because of this bill i'll have to pay
      MORE money to get my gear from countries that don't have such rediculous
      restrictions like I dunno bumfuck Egypt or somewhere, I really just want
      to piss down these peoples throats and shit down their necks. Ok enough
      of the hack journalism i'm too pissed off to continue... read the bill
      then mailbomb your local house representative as to why this is a stupid
      idea...
      
      Just some reasons this bill sucks:
      
      1) Citizens have helped out law enforcement officers by monitoring local
         action bands
      2) Citizens that are volunteer fire-fighters or emergency volunteers will
         have to spend extra money to locate and run exotic non-american made
         gear
      3) Licensed radio enthusiasts will have to pay even more for their gear and
         these fellas (and gals) help out with emergency nets out of their own
         pockets.
          
      4) The equipment already exists in abundance and will just make black market
         versions available to the masses en masse
         
      5) You can build your own scanner or convert any existing one using a transverter
         are they going to ban basic discreet components next???

     the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce 



                                                           A BILL

     To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to strengthen and clarify 
     prohibitions on electronic eavesdropping, and for other purposes. 

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
     States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the `Wireless Privacy Enhancement Act of 1999'.

     SEC. 2. COMMERCE IN ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING DEVICES.

     (a) PROHIBITION ON MODIFICATION- Section 302(b) of the Communications Act
     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 302a(b)) is amended by inserting before the period at 
     the end thereof the following: `, or modify any such device, equipment, or
     system in any manner that causes such device, equipment, or system to fail
     to comply with such regulations'.

     (b) PROHIBITION ON COMMERCE IN SCANNING RECEIVERS- Section 302(d) of such 
     Act (47 U.S.C. 302a(d)) is amended to read as follows:

     `(d) EQUIPMENT AUTHORIZATION REGULATIONS-

          `(1) PRIVACY PROTECTIONS REQUIRED- The Commission shall prescribe 
          regulations, and review and revise such regulations as necessary in
          response to subsequent changes in technology or behavior, denying 
          equipment authorization (under part 15 of title 47, Code of Federal
          Regulations, or any other part of that title) for any scanning receiver
          that is capable of--

          `(A) receiving transmissions in the frequencies that are allocated to 
               the domestic cellular radio telecommunications service or the personal
               communications service;

          `(B) readily being altered to receive transmissions in such frequencies;

          `(C) being equipped with decoders that--

                    `(i) convert digital domestic cellular radio 
                         telecommunications service, personal communications
                         service, or protected specialized mobile radio service
                         transmissions to analog voice audio; or
                
                   `(ii) convert protected paging service transmissions to
                         alphanumeric text; or
                         
          `(D) being equipped with devices that otherwise decode encrypted radio 
               transmissions for the purposes of unauthorized interception.

          `(2) PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR SHARED FREQUENCIES- The Commission shall, 
               with respect to scanning receivers capable of receiving 
               transmissions in frequencies that are used by commercial mobile 
               services and that are shared by public safety users, examine 
               methods, and may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary,
               to enhance the privacy of users of such frequencies.

          `(3) TAMPERING PREVENTION- In prescribing regulations pursuant to 
               paragraph (1), the Commission shall consider defining `capable of
               readily being altered' to require scanning receivers to be 
               manufactured in a manner that effectively precludes alteration of
               equipment features and functions as necessary to prevent commerce
               in devices that may be used unlawfully to intercept or divulge 
               radio communication.

          `(4) WARNING LABELS- In prescribing regulations under paragraph (1), 
               the Commission shall consider requiring labels on scanning receivers
               warning of the prohibitions in Federal law on intentionally intercepting 
               or divulging radio communications.

          `(5) DEFINITIONS- As used in this subsection, the term `protected' means 
               secured by an electronic method that is not published or disclosed except
               to authorized users, as further defined by Commission regulation.'.

     (c) IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS- Within 90 days after the date of enactment of
         this Act, the Federal Communications Commission shall prescribe amendments to
         its regulations for the purposes of implementing the amendments made by this 
         section.

     SEC. 3. UNAUTHORIZED INTERCEPTION OR PUBLICATION OF COMMUNICATIONS.

     Section 705 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 605) is amended--

          (1) in the heading of such section, by inserting `interception or' after `unauthorized';

          (2) in the first sentence of subsection (a), by striking `Except as authorized by chapter 119, title 18, United States Code, no person' and inserting `No
          person';

          (3) in the second sentence of subsection (a)--

               (A) by inserting `intentionally' before `intercept'; and

               (B) by striking `and divulge' and inserting `or divulge';

          (4) by striking the last sentence of subsection (a) and inserting the following: `Nothing in this subsection prohibits an interception or disclosure of a
          communication as authorized by chapter 119 of title 18, United States Code.';

          (5) in subsection (e)(1)--

               (A) by striking `fined not more than $2,000 or'; and

               (B) by inserting `or fined under title 18, United States Code,' after `6 months,'; and

          (6) in subsection (e)(3), by striking `any violation' and inserting `any receipt, interception, divulgence, publication, or utilization of any communication in
          violation';

          (7) in subsection (e)(4), by striking `any other activity prohibited by subsection (a)' and inserting `any receipt, interception, divulgence, publication, or
          utilization of any communication in violation of subsection (a)'; and

          (8) by adding at the end of subsection (e) the following new paragraph:

     `(7) Notwithstanding any other investigative or enforcement activities of any other Federal agency, the Commission shall investigate alleged violations of this
     section and may proceed to initiate action under section 503 of this Act to impose forfeiture penalties with respect to such violation upon conclusion of the
     Commission's investigation.'.

  14.0 Linux autofs overflow in 2.0.36+

                            Overflow in Autofs - Feb 18 1999
      _____________________________________________________________________________
      Affected: Linux autofs kernel module in linux-2.0.36 to 2.2.1
      Type of Problem: Buffer overflow in kernel module.
      Effects: Denial of Service, potential root exploit
      
      
      By:           Brian Jones &lt;balif@nacs.net>
      Contributors: Patrick Lewis &lt;patrick@apk.net>,
                    phazer &lt;phazer@battlemech.nws.net>
      _____________________________________________________________________________
      
      
                                        Summary
      
      
      
          The autofs kernel module does not check the size of the directory names
      it receives. It is passed the name and the names length through
      dentry->d_name.name and dentry->d_name.len respectively. Later on it
      memcpy()'s the name into a 256 byte buffer, using dentry->d_name.len as the
      number of bytes to copy, without checking its size. A nonprivilaged user may
      attempt to cd to a directory name exceeding 255 characters. This overwrites
      memory, probably the kernel stack and anything beyond it, and causes kernel
      errors or makes the machine reboot.
      
      
      
                                  Overview of Automount
      
      
      
      drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root            0 Feb 18 17:40 misc
      
      
          The autofs module provides support for the automount filesystem, as
      well as the interface between the kernel and the automountd daemon, which is
      responsible for the actual mounting. Calls such as chdir() executed in the
      automount directory are handled by the module, and if the desired directory
      is defined in the configuration files, automountd then mounts that
      directory/device.
      
      
      
                                         Details
      
      
      
          When a chdir() or similar function is called in the autofs directory,
      by a user doing something along the lines of "cd xxxx", the function
      fs/autofs/root.c:autofs_root_lookup() is called.
      
      
          autofs_root_lookup() receives the name of the directory through
      "dentry->d_name.name", and it's length through "dentry->d_name.len". The
      dentry structure is passed via pointer through two functions, each performing
      various operations along the way.
      
      
          It eventually reaches waitq:autofs_wait(). The name, length, and other
      bits of information are copied into a 'wq' structure, which stands for
      waiting queue. "wq.name" is "char *name", a pointer to the dentry pointer
      that refers back to the filename somewhere in the kernel.
      
      
          autofs_wait() then passes 'wq' to autofs_notify_daemon(), which copies
      the information into a structure called 'pkt'. This is passed to
      autofs_write(), which write()'s the packet down the pipe connecting the
      module with automountd.
      
      
      
                                      The Overflow
      
      
      
          The problem occurs when 'wq' is copied to 'pkt'. Before this point,
      the path name was shuffled around via pointers. 'pkt' is defined as:
      
      
              struct autofs_packet_missing pkt;
      
      
          struct autofs_packet_missing {
                  struct autofs_packet_hdr hdr;
                  autofs_wqt_t wait_queue_token;
                  int len;
                  char name[NAME_MAX+1];
          };
      
      
          NAME_MAX is 255, making pkt.name a 256 byte buffer.
      
      
          pkt.name is copied using this method:
      
      
              pkt.len = wq->len;
              memcpy(pkt.name, wq->name, pkt.len);
              pkt.name[pkt.len] = '\0';
      
      
          Remember that wq->len and wq->name are directly copied from the dentry
      structure. The len and name were never checked to ensure they would fit
      inside pkt's buffer. If you attempt to cd to a directory name over 255
      characters, you will overflow this buffer.
      
      
          Because this is running in the kernel, a large enough value can
      overwrite as much memory as you want, over top any process you want. No
      bounds checking is done, and the code makes no check to see if
      dentry->d_name.len is under 255.

          This quick fix limits the length of a directory name to 255
      characters, and patches /usr/src/linux-2.2.1/fs/autofs/root.c. I contacted
      the author, who said he was going to fix this at a different point in the
      code. This seems to work for the time being.

      I'd like to apologize for being so late with this e-mail as I have known
      about this problem for months. The vulnerability was discussed in a Thu, 10
      Sep 1998 BugTraq e-mail by Michal Zalewski (lcamtuf@IDS.PL). I replied to it
      with a quick patch. Here are some lines from my e-mail:
      
      
      > I'm not completely happy with this, as it modifies the reference parameter,
      > ptr, but it will solve the problem. However, later on:
      >

      >
      > Where eline is the same size as line. I think the real solution is to make
      > sure the buffer is larger (LOG_LINE_LENGTH) like Michal said, and make sure
      > modules and programs don't generate obsurdly long messages,  because you

      RedHat immediately issued a "fix" to their current package: sysklogd-1.3-26
      This "fix" is merely my patch (and nothing more). My patch DOES NOT fix the
      problem. As discussed by the package co-maintainer (Martin Schulze
      (joey@FINLANDIA.INFODROM.NORTH.DE)) the bug is fixed in the latest sysklogd
      package (1.3-30). In fact, the bug was fixed in 1996. What this comes down
      to is that any Linux distribution running an old sysklogd package (namely
      RedHat all versions) STILL has a potential (rather obscure) buffer overflow.
      They need to upgrade to the latest version ASAP. I e-mailed
      bugzilla@redhat.com and got no response.
      
      
      Thank you,

      Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the
      Taskpads feature, which is provided as part of the Microsoft(r) Windows(r)
      98 Resource Kit, Windows 98 Resource Kit Sampler, and BackOffice(r) Resource
      Kit, second edition. The vulnerability could allow a malicious web site
      operator to run executables on the computer of a visiting user. Only
      customers who have installed one of the affected products and who surf the
      web using the machine on which it is installed are at risk from this
      vulnerability.
      
      
      A fully supported patch is available to remove the Taskpads functionality,
      and Microsoft recommends that affected customers download and install it.
      
      
      Issue
      =====
      Taskpads is a feature provided by several Microsoft Windows Resource Kit
      products, as detailed below in Affected Software Versions. It is part of the
      Resource Kits' Tools Management Console Snap-in, and allows users to view
      and run Resource Kit Tools via an HTML page rather than through the standard
      Large Icon, Small, Icon, List, and Detailed Views. A vulnerability exists
      because certain methods provided by Taskpads are incorrectly marked as "safe
      for scripting" and can be misused by a web site operator to invoke
      executables on a visiting user's workstation without their knowledge or
      permission.
      
      
      The affected products are, by default, not installed on Windows 95, Windows
      98 or Windows NT«. The Windows 98 Resource Kit and Resource Kit Sampler can
      only be installed on Windows 98. The BackOffice Resource Kit can be
      installed on Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows NT, but is most commonly
      installed on Windows NT servers, which, per recommended security practices,
      usually will not be used for web surfing.
      
      
      While there have not been any reports of customers being adversely affected
      by these problems, Microsoft is releasing a patch to proactively address
      this issue. The patch for this issue works by removing the Taskpads
      functionality, which is rarely used. It does not affect any other features
      of the affected products.
      
      
      Affected Software Versions
      ==========================
      - Microsoft Windows 98 Resource Kit, Microsoft Windows 98
      - Resource Kit Sampler (included as part of Windows 98 but
         not installed by default)
      - Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, second edition

      had a hackerz CD at a time in the past but i couldn't run any!! do i
      have to learn more about C and C++ to achieve it like you, or what?
      anyway, i have some poor knowledge about "firwall", "wingate", "cracking
      tools" and ...
      very very poor!
      in brief, i want to know more about hacking and how to perform it and
      also the new hacking programs and alike.
      
      
      P.S: i don't have internet yet!
      P.S.S: i have heard of a program which can download a site to your
      account!! is it true? can anyone thankfully send it over?

     www.z-rock.com a local California branch of "Z-rock, the worlds rock 
     superstation" was recently cracked. The perpetrators of the crack claim
     that the site was only hacked to prove the point that their "security sucks".

     The crack was claimed to have been done by Nightmare, Shadow, Screeching 
     Demon, and some credit to Zonis Teqneek. They claim that no files were 
     deleted  and that the original index.html was backed up.
