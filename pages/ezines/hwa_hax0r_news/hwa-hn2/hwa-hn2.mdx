   Synopsis
   --------

   The purpose of this list is to 'digest' current events of interest that
  affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
  coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
  and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

   This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
  likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
  AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
  BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

   It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
  reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
  sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
  of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
  motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
  the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
  a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

         A bug in Microsoft's NT Server 4.0 can expose a server's user
         groups and users. It only effects NT servers with no firewall
         protection. The security breach was discovered last week by
         Vitali Chkliar. ZDNet reported earlier this week about the
         hole and wrote that  Chkliar had a webpage with 10 companies
         listed as susceptible but did not list them for security reasons

    @HWA
     

1.2  How do I hack?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You should probably be asking 'how do I crack?' but thats another story
    I couldn't leave this alone... so you wanna be a hacker and learn 'mad
    sk1llz' huh? well first off here are two snippets from a good article
    from AntiOnline for you to read over.

    Article quotes: http://www.antionline.com/SpecialReports/reflux/

    This article is about the group "ViRii" and their attacks on US govt
    computers, but it could be about you and your school or whatever ...

    1) So, you're too 'leet to get busted? maybe, maybe not ...

     "You think you have mad skills?, You and your crew are the best?...
     Thinking your too good to be caught?, Let me tell you... your never
     going to be caught, your techniques are so goddam elite that you could
     never be caught by the feds."

     "Your Seriously fucking mistaken...Theres somebody out there who is
     better then you and they are watching you. -Reflux "


    2) Oh and by the way, its not not just YOUR shit that gets messed with:

       "After Makaveli and TooShort were raided, the agents had proceeded to
       Calldan Coffman's Parents residence in North Bend Oregon where they
       had confiscated his parents computer hardware and software and went to
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       his grandparents house where they collected more computer equipment and
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       software.
       ~~~~~~~~~

      They then raided us, they handed LoaD the Search Warrant and Arrested
      Calldan Coffman, under federal Arrest Warrants, then they confiscated
                                                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      all the computer hardware and software and tore the place apart, they
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      had detained Me, LoaD and Kytten from ViRii and had cuffed Calldan and
      moved him."

      So, if you have to ask the question 'how do I hack?' or 'how do I become
     a hacker?' etc then you may as well give up now, you'll just end up in
     jail. Memorizing "the Mentor's last words" isn't enough .. install FreeBSD
     Trinux, or Linux on your system, play with it, if you develop a knack for
     code try contributing to the FreeBSD or Linux (etc) projects, you'll get
     'mad recognition' and help out the community to boot, oh yeah and the feds
     won't come and take away daddy's computer system.

    
     @HWA
     

2.0  From the editor:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     START
     ~~~~~
       Yeah issue #2 w00t. issue #1 came and went and we survived to tell 
     about it, quite the feat. The 1st 'issue' was mainly a preview deal 
     hopefully this one will not be too unwieldly however it won't be any
     meagre 20k file this time and I make no apologies for that, we're about
     content and news and providing it untarnished by corporate entities or 
     phed contamination.

     So... since i'm too tired to write more here and need to crash for a 
     while before installing the latest FreeBSD snap on my backup machine 
     i'll end with an invitation to send in information or articles for 
     inclusion in future issues, just mail it or send as a file attach to
     the addy below privacy and discretion assured (of course).

     Congrats, thanks, articles, news submissions and kudos to
     hwa@press.usmc.net complaints and all nastygrams and mailbombs can go
     to /dev/nul nukes, synfloods and smurfs to 127.0.0.1

     danke.

      You've probably heard of these guys or others like them, (the 609th
     were recently featured on America At Arms on TV) they are the people
     that are watching you after you get past the ".. monitored.." system
     banner on *.mil computer networked boxes. If you haven't been busted
     yet then you're probably not causing enough shit, but don't think for
     one minute that you're not being watched... there are bigger fish to
     fry in the InfoWar arena.

      Anyway, on to the fun stuff, I stumbled across the SensorCombat system
     while doing research on the 609th and InfoWar topic, there are screen
     shots available and the site promises to have a downloadable demo soon,
     it looks pretty interesting. This isn't the 'Doom' 3d game you may have
     seen the marines practicing with on tv its a tactical simulation game..
     check it out.

     "The SENSOR COMBAT program is a single-player/user campaign-level series
      of wargames, each game designed to illustrate the full dimension of
      warfare.

      SENSOR COMBAT utilizes modern military strategy and tactics, but adds
      the 5 pillars of IW in contemporary scenarios depicting missions
      ranging from peacekeeping operations (Bosnia) to major regional
      conflicts (Korea).  Political events can also impact the operation.
      The goal is to create a computer-simulated battlefield where different
      strategies can be evaluated, providing the player/student with insight
      into gaining information dominance."

3.0  Latest Web Browser Exploits
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     So you have the latest Netscape or MSIE? well its probably vulnerable
    to at least one exploit.


    Alert: IE 4.0 Security Zone compromise
    Aleph One (aleph1@DFW.NET)
    Tue, 20 Oct 1998 11:06:13 -0500

    New Internet Explorer vulnerability. As opposed to what Russ states below
    there is a new risk created by this vulnerability. The default setting for
    authentication in IE for the Medium security setting is to automatically
    logon to machines in the Intranet zone when the web server requests user
    authentication without prompting the user. Nice way for someone to go
    finishing for passwords by posting some message with an embedded URL in a
    newsgroup or mass emailing some corporation.

    From: Russ &lt;Russ.Cooper@RC.ON.CA>
    To: NTBUGTRAQ@LISTSERV.NTBUGTRAQ.COM
    Subject: Alert: IE 4.0 Security Zone compromise

    Sune Hansen, Webmaster of &lt;http://www.WorldWideWait.com>, discovered a
    security problem which affects Trust Zones within Internet Explorer
    4.0+.

    Basically, if you provide IE with &lt;http://3475932041>, you'll arrive at
    Microsoft's web site. However, it will be listed, and treated, as part
    of your Local Intranet Zone when in fact it should be part of any other
    zone.

    For anyone who has made no modifications to their zones (i.e. using the
    defaults supplied with IE), there is no difference since both Local
    Intranet Zone and Internet Zone are set to "Medium" security.

    If, however, modifications have been made to the zone security
    configuration such that, for example, the Internet Zone is more
    restrictive than the Local Intranet Zone, then the fact such 32-bit URLs
    end up being seen by IE as trusted can create a problem.

    IE appears to assume that anything it sees without a period in the URL
    should be treated as part of the Local Intranet Zone. Winsock then takes
    the address and properly translates it to a reachable IP address (you
    could just as easily use PING or some other utility with such an
    address).

    Sune tested this on Windows '98, and I've tested it on NT 4.0 SP4 RC2
    with IE 4.0 (SP1;2735 - 4.72.3110.8), and both caused the same problem.

    Essentially the problem exists within IE, and not NT, but since Sune is
    franticly seeking out media outlets to report the story, I figured it
    was worth a note here. Microsoft did receive a brief message from Sune
    on Sunday morning, although they were made more aware of the issues by
    the media trying to verify Sune's claims.

    I'm not trying to downplay the problem. Anyone who is using Trust Zones
    should understand that they, alone, will not prevent a site from placing
    a URL in the above fashion and causing a site to be viewed as a Local
    Intranet Zone site. Proxies, and Firewalls, however, are not affected by
    this and will properly enforce restrictions if so configured. The
    problem appears to reside entirely within the mechanism that IE uses to
    determine if something is part of the Local Intranet Zone when no
    servers are configured in that zone.

    My conversations with Microsoft indicate we will hear more when they
    have more fully investigated the ramifications of the issue.
    
    Cheers,
    Russ
    
    MSIE Exploits and crashing
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0(1) (3.02 is reported not to be vulnerable) 
    under win95, win98 and NT can be crashed and eventually made execute arbitrary code 
    with a little help from the &lt;EMBED> tag.

    The following:
    &lt;EMBED SRC=file://C|/A.ABOUT_200_CHARACTERS_HERE___________________>
    opens a dialog box and closes IE 4.0.
    It seems that the long file extension causes stack overrun.

    The stack is smashed - full with our values, EIP is also ours and CS=SS.
    So a string could be constructed, executing code at the client's machine.


    Solution: Microsoft has issued a patch at their site - "Embed issue".

     I have just tested this bug in Netscape 4.5 on a RedHat Linux 5.1 machine,
     Kermel 2.0.34 and with minor patching of the java, it is also effective.  I
     was sucessful in retrieving ANY LOCAL FILE with the World readable
     attribute. This includes the /etc/passwd file!  In netscape,
     Edit>Preferences>Advanced>Disable Javascript in Mail and News will block
     this exploit, unless the person has access to your web server.

     I have recently found many new trojans presumeably inspired by the
     infamous cDc Back Orifice and the Netbus trojans, both of which I have
     tested and found quite effective. I decided to take a look at what
     else was floating around and the following is a brief list of what i
     was able to uncover, I've not had a chance to try these all out yet but
     intend to make them available or at least link to the sites where they
     may be obtained so you can scrutinize them. What you don't know CAN and
     DOES hurt you...

     Trojan list: (For my reference - = still need it, + = have it) if you
     have one of the 'needs' or know where I can find it for review purposes
     please mail me. tnx.

     to educate yourself, you want to KILL KEVIN, FUCK KEVIN, BURN KEVIN.
     Yeah man, maybe after you've been in jail for 3yrs without a trial like
     Kevin Mitnick has you'll really be Fucking Hostile.

      This is the biggest bunch of shit i've seen in a long time, I can truly
     understand where these people are coming from and the ideas behind the
     outrage but I feel it is grossly misdirected. Sure there has been a lot
     of exposure on the net, sure people are posting 'Free Kevin' virtual
     stickers everywhere, and so they damn well should, haven't you gotten
     the point yet? the U.S govt is making a mockery of basic civil rights
     damn straight people are pissed off.

      It is NOT cool, it is NOT 'leet and it is completely STUPID to endorse
     this sort of movement. Lets nix this now before the joke comes back and
     bites you on the ass. If you don't know the story then shut the fuck up,
     you have no right to comment on it. If you truly believe Kevin is getting
     what he deserves then you are a misdirected moron or a fucking phed. - Ed

    From the website: http://www.trinux.org/

     "Trinux is a portable Linux distribution that boots from 2-3

      Trinux contains the latest versions of popular network
      security tools and is useful for mapping and monitoring
      TCP/IP networks.

      Trinux transforms an ordinary x86 PC into a powerful
      network [security] management workstation without
      modifying the underlying hardware or operating system.
      The default configuration uses a stripped down version
      of kernel 2.0.35 that should boot on any 386 or better
      with at least 12-16 megabytes of RAM. Hardware
      support for NICs is provided through kernel modules

     Reference: http://offshoreprofit.nu/identity/index.html

     There are some very good reasons (other than the obvious) for seeking
    out and aquiring a new identity. These include messy divorces, criminal
    records and tax problems, you don't want all that bad history following
    you around wherever you go now do you?. In the U.S.A all bank transactions
    are recorded and available for scrutiny by firms or private investigators
    etc..

     "Did you know that if you transfer amounts of over $10,000 (often
      already if you transfer amounts over $3,000), your friendly banker
      will report you to a semi-secret government agency called FinCEN
      for possible money laundering investigations?"

     Surprised? you shouldn't be, the US and Canada are more communist than
    Russia ever was in many ways, only difference here is that you're given
    a cleverly sugared illusion of freedom, ask someone from the ex-USSR or
    Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia etc ... they've lived under communist rule

5.2  Credit Card Phraud
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Source: Published Sunday, December 6, 1998, in the San Jose Mercury News

    CARD RISK
 
    There are many real threats to consumers' credit cards, but few are
    unique to the Internet. Most crimes involve poor security by a merchant
    or scams in which consumers give their number to a stranger. And
    credit card users face these risks regardless of where they use their
    card.

    April 1995: Hackers began disrupting service at America Online using
    a widely disseminated program called AOHell. Some posed as AOL
    employees to hoodwink customers into divulging their credit card
    numbers. AOL defeated the program and began spreading the
    following warning: ``Reminder: AOL staff will never ask for your
    password or billing information.''

    September 1995: Federal authorities accused two Berkeley hackers
    of breaking into a computer system for Tower Video stores and
    stealing about 2,000 credit card numbers. While the alleged crime
    occurred online, Tower collected the numbers in normal retail
    transactions.
 
    November 1996: Someone stole a laptop computer from the Foster
    City offices of Visa International containing information on about
    314,000 Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and Diner's
    Club accounts. The criminal was apparently interested in the computer
    and never used any of the cards, a Visa spokesman said.

    April 1997: A computer containing financial information for 3,000
    CalTrain customers was stolen from a Santa Clara depot. It contained
    financial data on 2,500 customers who bought their tickets with checks
    and 500 who charged their tickets to their credit cards.

    May 1997: The FBI arrested a man trying to sell 100,000 credit card
    numbers stolen from the computers of a San Diego Internet service
    provider. Any credit card database that's connected to a
    communications network -- as virtually all are -- faces similar risk.

    November 1997: Four teenagers hacked into an Internet service
    provider and gained access to the records of an unidentified Internet
    auction house, where they obtained credit card numbers they later used
    to buy computer equipment.

     Subject:      Freestats.com CGI vulnerability
     To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org

     About a year ago I developed an exploit for the free web stats services
     offered at freestats.com, and supplied the webmaster with proper code to
     patch the bug.  After hearing no reply, and seeing no fix in sight, I've
     decided to post it here.

     Procedure:

     Start an account with freestats.com, and log in.  Click on the area that
     says "CLICK HERE TO EDIT YOUR USER PROFILE & COUNTER INFO"  This will call
     up a file called edit.pl with your user # and password included in it.
    
     Save this file to your hard disk and open it with notepad.  The only form
     of security in this is a hidden attribute on the form element of your account
     number.  Change this from *input type=hidden name=account value=your#* to
     *input type=text name=account value=""*  Save your page and load it into your
     browser.

     Their will now be a text input box where the hidden element was before.
     Simply type a # in and push the "click here to update user profile" and all
     the information that appears on your screen has now been written to that user
     profile.

     But that isn't the worst of it.  By using frames (2 frames, one to hold this
     page you just made, and one as a target for the form submission) you could
     change the password on all of their accounts with a simple JavaScript function.

     Any thoughts, questions, or comments?

    From:         Tatu Ylonen &lt;ylo@SSH.FI>
    Organization: SSH Communications Security, Finland
    Subject:      security patch for ssh-1.2.26 kerberos code

    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

    This message contains information relevant to people who compile ssh
    with --with-kerberos5.  There is one or more potential security
    problem in the Kerberos code.  These issues are not relevant for
    people who have not explicitly specified --with-kerberos5 on the
    configure command line.

    Peter Benie &lt;pjb1008@cam.ac.uk> found a buffer overflow in the
    kerberos authentication code.  To quote from his mail:

    > What about sshconnect.c, line 1139
    >
    >     sprintf(server_name,"host/%s@", remotehost);
    >
    > where remotehost is (char *) get_canonical_hostname() (up to 255 chars),
    > is copied into server_name (a 128 char buffer)?
 
    It looks to me like this is a genuine buffer overflow.  I had not
    noticed it when going through the code.
 
    This buffer overflow is, however, extremely hard to exploit:

    1. The victim must have have client compiled with --with-kerberos5 and
       --enable-kerberos-tgt-passing.
    2. The victim must be connecting to a server running with the same
       options (i.e., krb5 with tgt passing).
    3. You must do the following DNS spoofing:
       - fake reverse map for the *server*
       - fake forward map for the fake reversed name
    4. You must fake your attack code to look like valid DNS records; this
       is highly untrivial with modern versions of bind that reject all
       domain names with invalid characters in them.
    5. Only the part of the DNS name beyond 128 bytes can be exploited; that
       must be made to align with stack frames and must contain appropriate
       return addresses and jump addresses.  It has been shown that this can
       generally be done, but the space and structural constraints here are
       extremely tight compared to most instances of buffer overflow
       exploits.
    6. Since the client with Kerberos TGT passing is only used
       interactively, the user will almost certainly notice that something
       went wrong.  I don't think you can, within the structure and space
       constraints, construct the code so that the user would not notice at
       least the client crashing.
    7. You cannot try again after a failed attack until the client again
       tries to log into the same host.

    This might yield an attack against the *client*.

    I've fixed this in the source tree.

    I'd like to thank Peter for reporting this.  A fix will be included in
    the next release (which I expect in about a week).

6.3  BOFREEZE - Been orificed? freeze those buggers!
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     If you have been bitten by BO theres a damn good chance you deserved it
     but in case you're a hapless victim BOFreeze will bite people on the ass
     that are running (or trying to run) BO on your system.

     From the site:

     "BO FREEZE is a program which listens on UDP port 31337 (or a port of
     your choice - port 31337 since this is the default listening port for a
     BO server) for BO client packets, all of which are encrypted with a 16
     bit encryption key.  Each client packet, when it has been decrypted,
     starts with this string:  *!*QWTY?

     BO FREEZE can recognise not just one encrypted BO packet, not even 10 or
     100 - not even 1000 - but ALL 65536 (that's 216) different possible
     encrypted BO client packets!!!  This means that regardless of what pass
     word is used at the BO client end, BO FREEZE can still recognise a BO
     packet when it sees one!  So what is the point of all this?  And why is
     the program called BOFREEZE?

     Quiet simply, cDc (Cult of the Dead Cow - the hacking organisation who
     created BO) did not write very good code in their BO GUI (and command
     driven) BO client.  As a result, WZC Productions has found that sending
     malformed data packets back to the client using the correct encryption
     key causes major problems for the BO client user.  With the command
     driven client, strange and fabulous characters appear on the screen
     (effectively disabling the client completely because its packet buffer
     becomes full) and with the GUI client - that just freezes up
     completely!!!

     The point is this.  All that is needed is 1 person in 254 on the net to
     be running BO FREEZE (liken this to your computer being the "bad apple"
     in a bag of apples) and it will cause major problems for people who
     perform ping sweeps, trying to track down computer systems with BO
     installed on them!

7.0 HackingIRC'98 (Part 1) -- WARNING! Patch your eggdrops!
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * This is an excerpt from the HackingIRC'98 textfile by Cruciphux

    Prologue
    ~~~~~~~~

     IRC is a joke yes we all know that, BUT for some insane reason people
    still tend to take it so serious, thats why we have ppl taking down entire
    networks with smurf attacks coz joecool operator or mr'leet was nasty to
    us .. anyways to add more mayhem or perhaps help clear some of it up I
    wrote this text since most others are so out of date its not funny...

    Crashing Eggdrop Bots
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following will crash eggdrop bots: (Tested on version v1.3.8) probably
    works on 1.3.x I believe this one requires that TCL be *enabled*.

    You MUST have access to the bot (regardless of level) in order for most
    of the current known overflows to work. These will merely cause the egg
    to die with a segfault error.

7.1  Hacked Web Sites: The latest 'fun thing to do?'
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     You know, I have a problem with the current trend of hacking websites
    and pages, especially when the perps do not leave a backup of the
    original site intact. It seems that in order for some to 'prove'
    themselves they need to hack a page and greet all their friends, their
    dog and their bum buddies.

     At one time it actually meant something, sites were hacked to purvey a
    message of socio-political or purely political importance, sites were
    hacked to prove major security flaws existed that were being denied by
    security "experts" or product pushers, nowadays its no more significant
    than spray paint on a wall. Having said all that I still believe the
    socio-political 'righteous' hacks have a place, but if you're a newbie
    looking for fame, word up, you'll just end up in the flamers hall of
    lame, the net never forgets. - Ed


    "You think its anarchy when you trash our halls?, trash a bank
    if you've got real balls" - The Dead Kennedy's

    There have been SO many websites hacked lately its almost useless
    and certainly boring following them all, if you want though I will
    chronicle them here, email me your opinion. Meanwhile these sites
    do a good job of archiving old and new hacked websites:
