   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

 00.1 CONTACT INFORMATION AND MAIL DROP
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Wahoo, we now have a mail-drop, if you are outside of the U.S.A or
    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.

    Send all goodies to:

	    HWA NEWS
	    P.O BOX 44118
	    370 MAIN ST. NORTH
	    BRAMPTON, ONTARIO
	    CANADA
	    L6V 4H5

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

    bugtraq, send mail to listserv@netspace.org containing the message body

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour &lt;sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

    EoC    - End of Commentary

    EoA    - End of Article or more commonly @HWA

    EoF    - End of file

    EoD    - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN &lt;g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper
             noun means the hackernews site proper. k? k. ;&

            Phreaking, Hacking, Anarchy, Cracking, Carding (CC) Groups Virus, Warfare

          Alternates: H - hacking, hacktivist

   *RTFM  - Read the fucking manual - not always applicable since some manuals are
            pure shit but if the answer you seek is indeed in the manual then you
            should have RTFM you dumb ass.

    TBC   - To Be Continued also 2bc (usually followed by ellipses...) :^0

    TBA   - To Be Arranged/To Be Announced also 2ba

    TFS   - Tough fucking shit.

       It seems that a french techincian was able to break the credit card system used in france 
       (and worldwide) using some common hardware. Using his PC, he build a false credit card and
       used it (not in an illegal way).
       
       Of course, being a "good" citizen he warned the "banque de fance" (fench cental bank) of 
       the poblem. To thank him, he had the visit fom the fench cops and was chaged of credit card
       fraud ...

       HI!!
       Great Mag you got...keep you the good work.
       Anyway....
       I write to you because I found a funny 'bug'.
       On many homepages there is a "search" botten ,try it!!
       I tryed and found alot of funny stuff like emails,login...
       and other stuff. It can give you a good idea if you are going to SE the firm. The best 
       to look for is  files like .dat .passwd .htpasswd and other system files that 
       are interesting too "look" at.
       ----
       Here is one the exampel i tryed:
       www.global-one.net  (a very BIG ISP)
       search for .dat
       http://www.global-one.net/en/consultant/con-reg.dat
       ----
       I have seen many other site with the same 'bug' ,but I really don't know is its a old bug..
       or just a programmer error.
       please give me some credit for it if you are going to 
       publish it and if its any good.... (I hope so....hehehe)

       Harvard defends role in dean's resignation
       amid porn claims 
 
       By James Bandler, Globe Correspondent and Ross Kerber Globe Staff, 07/03/99 
 
           n his first public comment on the matter, Harvard President Neil L.
           Rudenstine has defended his university's role in the forced resignation
       of the Harvard Divinity School dean who stepped down last fall amid
       allegations of pornography use on his office computer.
 
       Rudenstine rejected criticism in the press that divinity school technicians had
       violated the privacy of Dean Ronald Thiemann by notifying authorities about
       the presence of pornography on his office computer.
 
       ''At no time did any Harvard personnel violate Professor Thiemann's privacy,''
       Rudenstine said in a written statement released Thursday.
 
       The role of the university's technology staff was reviewed at the senior levels
       of the university and there was nothing invasive or inappropriate about the
       staff's actions, he said.
 
       ''Rather, staff members repeatedly and over a period of more than a year
       carried out tasks that the dean directed them to perform, consistent with their
       official duties, in a place that had clearly become part of their professional
       work environment. 
 
       ''In so doing, they were unavoidably and involuntarily exposed to inappropriate
       materials which they found to be not only offensive, but severely distressing.''
 
       Thiemann, who presided over the divinity school for nearly 13 years, stepped
       down in November citing personal and professional reasons. He has not
       commented publicly on the matter.
 
       Thiemann's lawyer, Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree, said
       Thiemann was profoundly disappointed by Rudenstine's statement. He said
       that it was difficult to understand why the university did not contact Thiemann
       about the allegations earlier if there really had been problems for a year.
 
       ''Dean Thiemann has made every effort to respect and maintain the privacy
       for him and his family and has avoided any public comment on the allegations,''
       Ogletree said. ''After 13 years of unprecedented success serving as dean of
       the divinity school, there is a strong feeling that he is now being kicked in the
       stomach when he's down, while the university continues to protect the privacy
       of those who have made allegations against dean.''
 
       Sources at Harvard said the pornographic material was discovered in October
       on Thiemann's Harvard-owned computer after he requested a new hard drive
       to replace his existing one, which was full. The computer was in the office of
       Thiemann's Harvard-owned residence.
 
       Sources said that an explicit pornographic image was on the computer screen
       when a technician walked into the room. Ogletree said the incident did not
       happen.
 
       In a process that involved down-loading the files from the old hard drive to the
       divinity school's mainframe to the new hard drive the technician saw sexually
       explicit file names crossing the screen, according to sources.
 
       Because of the presence of so many image files, the file transfer process took
       an entire work day, the sources said. When the technician's supervisor
       inquired why the transfer was taking so long, he did not want to answer, but
       eventually did, the sources said.
 
       Rudenstine said in his statement that staff members were ''reluctant to report
       the matter,'' and eventually spoke only to senior officers at the divinity school.
       After consultation, the senior officers reported the facts to the university
       president's office, Rudenstine said.
 
       After the pornography scandal became public this spring, Thiemann became
       something of a reluctant cause celebre among Internet privacy rights activists.
       In the Thursday edition of the Boston Phoenix, media critic Dan Kennedy
       singled out Rudenstine in his annual ''Muzzle Awards,'' a list of people who
       Kennedy said undermine free speech.
 
       Harvard, for the most part, declined to respond to the attacks. But it was the
       recent remarks of Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz that
       prompted the university to defend its beleaguered information technology staff
       after he referred to them as ''snoops'' and ''peeping toms.''
 
       In other Harvard news, the university said that on Wednesday its technicians
       removed an independently produced Web site from school computers after
       receiving a complaint that it contained offensive material.
 
       University spokesman Joe Wrinn said the site was operated by a group known
       as PacketStorm Security, led by a site administrator in North Carolina.
       Harvard had made an unusual agreement recently to host the popular site in
       order to help distribute software security tools.
 
       But in addition, the PacketStorm's site included graphic sexual images and
       other material apparently intended to satirize a rival Web site, AntiOnline.com,
       devoted to software security matters.
 
       According to a letter to Harvard from AntiOnline founder John Vranesvich,
       the PacketStorm site included ''a large archive of libelous and, to put it bluntly,
       sick material,'' including '' images ranging from people engaged in homosexual
       activities, to a nun that appears to be covered in seminal fluid.''
 
       The descriptions were accurate, said Harvard spokesman Wrinn, prompting
       the university to remove the site from its computers because it violated school
       policies. Harvard is in the process of returning the data to PacketStorm
       administrator Ken Williams, Wrinn said.
 
       Williams could not be reached for comment, but in a letter posted on a
       different site on the Web he denied that his site had posed a threat to
       Vranesevich and complained that in shutting down the site, Harvard acted
       inapropriately, because ''no laws or rules were broken on my part.''

      Coming Soon: Back Orifice 2000
      by Niall McKay 

      3:00 a.m.  30.Jun.99.PDT
      An underground computer security group is poised to release a new version of a
      notorious software program that could allow crackers to watch and listen in on
      Windows-based PC users. 

      The Cult of the Dead Cow said it will release Back Orifice 2000 on 9 July -- at
      the annual Def Con convention in Las Vegas. 

      "This will demonstrate that Microsoft's operating systems are completely
      insecure and a bad choice for consumers and businesses who demand privacy,"
      said Oxblood Ruffin, a former United Nations consultant and current Cult of
      the Dead Cow spokesman. 


        
      Def Con is perhaps the most unusual gathering in the computer security field.
      Hackers, crackers, and self-proclaimed security experts will mingle with media,
      security professionals, federal law enforcement officers, and "script kiddies"
      who deface Web pages with prefab cracking code. 

      Security groups of all stripes use the occasion to release software and show
      off gadgets. But Back Orifice 2000 is perhaps the most anticipated item. 

      Unlike previous versions of the software, Back Orifice 2000 will run on Windows NT
      and feature strong encryption and a modular architecture that the group said
      will allow hackers and other security groups to write plug-ins. 

      The program will be released as open source to encourage further development
      by the security community. 

      Back Orifice, released at last year's DefCon, may allow malicious users to monitor
      and tamper with computers without the permission or knowledge of their owners. 

      The program is classified as a Trojan Horse because crackers need to dupe the
      user into installing an application on their hard disk. Despite this, Oxblood Ruffin
      said that the program is currently installed on up to a half-million PCs
      worldwide. 

      Though that number could not be independently verified, an Australian
      computer security group last November said that 1,400 Australian Internet
      accounts have been compromised by Back Orifice. 

      Back Orifice 2000 also promises to be a great deal more difficult to detect than
      its predecessor because it enables users to configure its port setting. Previously,
      intrusion detection and antivirus programs could detect Back Orifice because it used
      a default port setting of 31337. 

      A Microsoft Windows NT Server security manager said the company is closely
      monitoring Back Orifice development and is working with antivirus and intrusion
      detection software vendors to provide customers with utilities to combat the
      software. 
      
      "Trojan Horses are not technological issues but a social engineering problem
      because they rely on the ability of the cracker to trick the user into running an
      application," said Scott Culp. 

      "It's just a fact of computer science that if you run a piece of code on your
      machine you run the risk making your system vulnerable." 

      The solution, according to Culp, is to ensure that users do not install any
      software from untrusted sources and regularly update antivirus and intrusion
      detection programs. 

      Also at the show, independent security consulting firm L0pht Heavy Industries will
      release AntiSniff, a network monitoring tool, and will announce BootyCall, a
      PalmPilot War Dialer. Such programs will automatically dial telephone numbers in
      sequence, looking for modems. 

      Zero-Knowledge Systems is also expected to provide further details about Freedom,
      a network of servers promising total online anonymity. 

      Def Con will also feature some of its legendary sideshow attractions, such as
      the Spot the Fed contest. In this game, conference attendees are invited to point
      out suspicious attendees who may be working for federal law enforcement
      agencies. Winners will be awarded an "I spotted the Fed" T-shirt. 

      Other diversions include a fancy dress ball, Hacker Jeopardy, and the Hacker
      Death Match, a game that enables hackers to take their flame mails out of
      cyberspace and into reality by dressing up in giant inflatable Sumo suits to do
      battle. 

      Well-heeled attendees are invited to a US$100 outing to Cirque du Soleil. 

      Meanwhile, the conference will include sessions on how to detect wiretaps; the
      art and science of enemy profiling; hacking ethics, morality, and patriotism;
      cyber-forensic analysis; and a talk on the practice of hiring hackers as security
      consultants.

      And DefCon; heres an update from Wired on defcon;

      DefCon: Bring in Da Noise
      by Polly Sprenger 

      8:15 a.m.  8.Jul.99.PDT
      Every year it's the same. 

      DefCon rolls around, and every media outlet churns out an article citing an "old
      school" hacker complaining that the "script kiddies" don't have any skills, don't
      have any respect, and never had to rebuild an Altair with their bare hands. 

      Here you go: "I've been a hacker since before there were microcomputers," said
      Chris Tucker, a one-time hacker who is now semi-retired due to arthritis. "I see
      [DefCon] as an opportunity to act like a mentor, to say 'this is how it should be
      done, don't give in to the dark side kids.'"

      But while the older generation of DefCon attendees is hand-wringing over the fact
      that "kids these days don't even write their own exploits anymore," the younger
      generation is busy donning fright wigs and fingernail polish in preparation for another
      DefCon staple: the raves. 

      Hackers and raves have gone hand in hand since the industrial music of the '80s
      gave way to the electronica of the '90s, said The Clone, one of this year's
      attendees. 

      "DefCon is a weekend event held from early in the morning until about 10pm," he
      said. "What's there to do between then and morning? Sleep? Of course not. Going
      raving is where it's at." 

      This year's conference coincides with the anniversary party of Candy FactorE, a
      locale that The Clone said has propelled the Vegas raving scene. 

      "Two underground scenes combine in one city. What could be better?," he asked. 

      Brian Fite of HSK, a security-interest site, said that even the music divides the
      old-timer hackers from the younger generation. 

      "I came out of hard core punk, the old school," he said. "Now, house music and
      raves is the 'underground.'" 

      But if raves is what they come for, raves is what they'll get, Fite said. More than
      24 bands and DJs have been invited to perform onstage at DefCon. Their musical
      genres, listed on the DefCon site, range from industrial to house to jungle to
      trance. 

      Brandon Cox, another HSK staffer attending DefCon for the first time, said
      he expects the difference between the two groups of hackers to be obvious: "All
      the young guys will be walking around in baggy pants and Adidas', and all the old
      guys will be wearing Doc Martens and black T-shirts." 

      The musical performances will be Webcast by Pirate Radio UK, for anyone
      who wants to experience the music remotely. 

      Cox, 25, said hackers of his generation are attracted to the techno music both
      because of its roots in technology and the way it draws together the
      underground. "I think it was young, outcast kids, looking for a way to fit in,"
      Cox said. 

      "Maybe it's more that everybody is accepted," said Fite. "A lot of these
      hip-hop kids dress weird, and accept other, different cultures. Diversity is good
      for the species." 

      But ravers, like non-malicious hackers, resent the image that gets presented to
      the public about their subculture. 

      "There have been rumors of undercover reporters looking for 'hot' sweeps week
      stories in raves," said "Driz," a Vegas-area raver. "One misinformed story gives off a
      surprising amount of bad impressions. If there's a trace of something juicy,
      reporters seem to turn on their hidden cameras and focus on the negativity." 

      But ravers like Driz can see past the negativity. "There is nothing better when
      there's a smile on every face, the music is thumpin', everyone's dancing, and the
      vibes are good!"

      Fear and Hacking in Las Vegas 
      by Polly Sprenger 

      3:00 a.m.  10.Jul.99.PDT
      LAS VEGAS -- The sun rose Friday morning on the first day of Def Con, the
      annual hacker conference, with labor crews hosing down the parking lots and
      the highways. 

      Workers were dealing with the aftermath of an unexpected thunderstorm that shut
      down the airport Thursday and left the city sunk in a thick layer of mud. 

      More than 600 of Def Con's 6,000 expected attendees were already in town
      for the Black Hat security conference. The timing was unfortunate, however.
      Next door to the predominately male-attended Black Hat conference was
      a teenage dance competition, where, after spending the day listening to talks
      on security issues, attendees could watch adolescent dancers shaking their
      groove thang. 

      "Someone's gonna get arrested," sighed Chris, from Toronto, in the bar of the
      nearby Hard Rock Cafe later. 


       But by mid-morning, hackers shook off their Thursday night hangovers to
      descend on the convention hall. Hacker groups and enthusiasts did a brisk trade
      in T-shirts, hacker equipment, and zines. 

      As a TV crew cruised the hall, an organizer asked everyone to be mature
      and not deface the camera. 

      "Be good, and next time Mom will let you wear the big pants," he said to the
      youthful, baggy-panted crowd. 

      Convention-goers were testing their competitive side in the sixth annual Spot
      the Fed contest (several agents were outed by early afternoon), and by
      donning inflatable sumo wrestling suits for a little all-in-fun mock violence. 

      "Always wanted to beat up some punk on the mailing list? You really hate the
      person who always argues with you?" DefCon organizers asked. "How about media
      vs. the underground? Or feds vs. hackers? We've rented giant inflatable
      sumo suits for you to do battle." 

      T-shirts like "I miss crime" and "I hate stupid people" caught approving glances
      from the crowd, while a photographer wandered around the room snapping
      shots of any available woman for the "Babes of Def Con" photo album. 

      Outside the smoky, crowded hall, a group of younger attendees was gleefully
      stringing cable from hotel room to hotel room, beefing up the paltry connection
      offered by the Alexa Park convention center and resort. 

      The "day in the sun" feeling was soured a bit as a group of security enthusiasts
      posted "wanted" signs accusing John P.Vranesevich, founder of AntiOnline, of
      criminal activities. They accuse the computer security pundit of paying
      crackers to hit sites in exchange the scoop. 

      Vranesevich and his supporter, Happy Hacker Carolyn Meinel, vocally deny that
      he has done anything wrong, and point the finger back at the accusers, who
      have posted material about Vranesevich on their Web site. 

      The controversy escalated last week, when a popular site for security
      information, PacketStorm, was removed from its host server at Harvard after
      university officials were told that the site had negative and allegedly libelous
      information about Vranesevich on it. 

      But according to Brian Fite of HSK, the tension only adds another dimension of
      excitement to the goings-on. 

      Also on the underground agenda is a party to announce the "launch" of Back
      Orifice 2000, a hacking tool for Microsoft office 2000; a formal black-and-white ball
      where T-shirts will be traded in for tuxes;  and assorted, sordid all-night raves.

      Defcon Recovery 


      contributed by Space Rogue 
      We are still hung over and recovering from Defcon this past weekend. Our plane landed just hours ago and we
      are currently reading the 1200+ emails that have piled up over the last six days. We should hoepfully have
      regular news for your tomorrow. 

      Defcon Notes
      The estimated attendance for Defcon this year was 3000 people. 1200 more people than last year. 

      The BO2K presentation was standing room only. A few early copies of BO2K were thrown out to the crowd on
      CD. Someone took one of those copies and duplicated it. Unfortunately the dups are infected with CIH. If you
      did not receive an original copy be sure to double check it. 

      Carolyn Meinel was escorted out of the Alexis Park Hotel. The official reason given for the ejection was due
      to two seperate violations of press privilages. 

      The Defcon.org Web Page was cracked just as the con was starting on Friday. We should hopefully have an
      archived copy soon. 

      We hope to return to full coverage of all the news tomorrow. Hopefully we will be sober by then.

      Hackers Say Government Falls Short on
      Computer Security

      By MATT RICHTEL  

           AS VEGAS -- A White House official took a verbal pounding
           Friday night at a conference of computer hackers and security
      professionals, some of whom accused the Government of inadequately
      protecting its computers. 

      The criticisms came during a panel debate called "Meet the
      Feds" at Defcon, the annual gathering of computer hackers. 

      After the discussion, Jeffrey A. Hunker, senior director for
      infrastructure protection for the National Security Council,
      conceded that the hackers have a point when they say that the
      Government has far to go. "We have something to learn from
      them," he said. 

      Malicious hackers, known as "crackers," have taught the Government
      several lessons in recent months, taking down several major Web sites
      including those of the White House, Senate and FBI. 

      Many of the more than 2,000 attendees at Defcon VII are not interested
      in wreaking havoc. They are computer security professionals and hackers
      with a general interest in deconstructing computer code, although their
      standard black attire and occasional arrogance gave the conference some
      menacing overtones. 

      Around 400 attendees gathered in a main auditorium to hear Hunker
      speak, and some took him to task and accused the Government of
      ignoring security issues for too long. 

      Chief among the criticisms was that the
      Government should not rely so heavily on
      software from the Microsoft Corp. The
      company is a perennial whipping boy at Defcon
      because many of its programs have been shown
      to contain security flaws. 

      Hunker and several other Government
      employees on the panel, including a
      representative from the Defense Department,
      said they have been hampered by limited funds and a lack of qualified
      technical personnel. Hunker said the Government is pouring resources
      into the security problem and that President Clinton's proposed budget
      for fiscal year 2000 includes $500 million in financing for research and
      development, of which a portion would go to bolstering the computer
      infrastructure. 

      "Almost all of the systems we are dependent on have significant
      vulnerabilities," Hunker said. "This conference is about identifying the
      vulnerabilities." 

      Some in attendance responded well to Hunker's conciliatory
      tone, complimenting him afterwards on his effort to start a
      dialogue with hackers. Hunker said that while he has followed
      cutting-edge hacking technology, the conference was
      the first time he has immersed himself in hacker culture. 

      At least one hacker in the crowd was unforgiving. "I hope they hack all
      the '.gov' sites in the next 12 months, just like they said they would," said
      a hacker in his mid-20s who identified himself only as "Codepoet,"
      referring to threats from cracker groups to take down all Government
      Web pages. "There's a lot of arrogance on the part of the Government
      about technology," he said. 

      Contributing to the tension between hackers and Government officials at
      the conference were the recent raids by the FBI on computer crime
      suspects. In June, a new cybercrime unit overseen by the United States
      Attorney's office in Dallas said it had issued 16 warrants in 12
      jurisdictions after a year-long investigation into hacking-related crimes,
      but had not yet charged anyone. 

      Before Defcon began, its organizers insisted the raids would have minimal
      impact on the conference. But a handful of crackers who confessed to
      participating in illicit activities privately whispered that they have
      newfound concerns about whether they might be next. 

      "They reacted, so we reacted, so they reacted, so we reacted," said
      Codepoet, referring to the arms race between crackers and government.
      (He identified himself as a hacker, not a cracker.) The tension "is
      somewhat heightened," he said. 

      Marc Maiffret, also known as
      Chameleon, had his home
      raided by the FBI last summer
      but was never charged with a
      crime. He said the raids have
      frightened some of the young
      hackers. Maiffret said he now
      works as a computer security
      professional. "People are
      afraid," he said. "There is a lot of
      pressure to go legit." 

      Some said they were on edge because they did not know who might be
      raided next or what activities might put them on the radar of Government
      agents. That uncertainty is perpetuated in part by the Government itself,
      which has not yet issued any charges or made arrests in relation to the
      June raids. 

      Nor has the Government said what areas of computer activity it is
      targeting, besides stating generally that the activities under investigation
      include stealing and misusing credit card numbers and computer
      passwords. A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's office in
      Dallas, where the year-long investigation originated, declined to comment
      on what she described as an "ongoing investigation." 

      However, a representative of the Nevada Attorney General's office who
      spoke at Defcon conceded that the Government is having trouble finding
      evidence of crimes on computers that it has confiscated. 

      "We're behind on this stuff," said Kevin Higgins, Nevada's Chief Deputy
      Attorney General. "We may have gotten warrants and computers, but we
      may not know how to find" the evidence, he said. 

                                     In some respects, it is notable
                                     that these high-ranking
                                     Government officials came to
                                     mingle with a gaggle of hackers
                                     and crackers at all. The image is
                                     in stark contrast to the origins of
                                     Defcon seven years ago, when it
                                     truly was a small gathering of
                                     insiders from the hacker
                                     underground. 

                                     It used to be that hackers who
      spoke to the press were derided by their peers as "media whores." But
      this year, for the first time, the organizers of Defcon hired a publicity firm
      to work with reporters and set up interviews. Among the firm's other
      clients are Alicia Silverstone and Michael Richards (Kramer from
      "Seinfeld") -- not exactly icons of underground culture. 

      Some hackers said privately that Defcon, which was conceived as an
      underground gathering and flourished that way, may be dying as it
      attracts a more diverse crowd. But the newfound openness may well suit
      Hunker, the White House official, and others who want to co-exist with
      hackers and even learn from them. 

      "I want to get to know the hacker community better," he said. "These
      people are America's future."

       Privacy hits big at DEF CON
       By Robert Lemos, ZDNN
       July 12, 1999 11:58 AM PT
       URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2292148,00.html
       
       LAS VEGAS -- As he sits across the table at DEF CON 7, Austin Hill, president and founder of
       the pro-privacy Zero Knowledge Systems Inc., makes the statement simply, boldly: "We are out
       to change the world." 
       
       His vision: A world without boundaries, law enforcement without wiretaps, corporations without
       databases, and e-mail without spam. 
       
                             Hill announced the start of that vision on Sunday at DEF CON: A
                             network that acts as a one-way mirror to the Internet -- the user can
                             see the Net, but no site will be able to identify who the user actually
                             is. 
       
                             Called Freedom Net, the virtual-network-within-the-Internet will
                             allow Web surfers and e-mail users to hide behind one or several
                             false identities. "This is the way the Internet should have been built,"
       said Hill. "It's not anonymous; it's pseudnonymous." 
       
       And it's not just for hackers, either, adds Hill. 
       
       Inequality of information
       The Montreal, Canada, resident sees a big problem with the inequity of information today: The
       government and companies have it while the public does not, he said. "We can do society more
       good by protecting the ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the people out there that are not criminals
       than by treating them as such just to catch the point-one percent that are." 
       
       In just the last year, Internet service providers, such as America Online Inc. (NYSE:AOL) and
       Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), have been subpoenaed to turn over the actual identity behind an
       online alias in not only criminal cases, but civil ones as well. 
       
       John Q. Newman, another speaker at the conference and author of many how-to privacy books,
       uses his pseudonym not only online, but in the real world as well. "There is a general feeling that
       the government and industry know too much about you," said the author, who doesn't use his real
       name. "Combine that and the Internet and you get a witch's brew that destroys privacy." 
       
       Beta testing on July 15
       Entering beta testing on July 15, the Freedom Network is guaranteed to prevent such use of
       personal information, said Zero Knowledge's Hill. 
       
       After downloading a free software client, users will pay for a pseudonym to use on the Internet.
       Since the audit trails associated with credit card payments are one way that a user's identity could
       be tracked, Zero Knowledge will disassociate a user's payment from the actual purchase or
       renewal of a pseudonym. 
       
       After that, the user just uses the Internet as they always would. All data transferred to and from
       the user's computer will pass through the silvered glass of the Freedom Net. The network fully
       encrypts data from end-to-end to hide the content of the data and uses random routes through the
       Internet so that no user always receives data from a single server, obfuscating the user's online
       tracks. 
       
       Using digital certificate technology, Zero Knowledge certifies that the data the user is receiving off
       the Internet is actually part of the Freedom Network, and thus "trustworthy." Yet, even the
       company cannot match usernames up with actual Web surfers -- none of that information is on any
       of its servers. 
       
       "There is basically zero point in coming to our office with a subpoena," said Ian Goldberg, Internet
       guru and chief scientist for Zero Knowledge. "All the information that we have is publicly available
       from our servers." 
       
       A lawsuit in waiting?
       And that makes Zero Knowledge and its Freedom Network a lawsuit waiting to happen, said Hill.
       Already, U.S. federal officials have noticed the start-up's efforts. Hill expects the situation to reach
       a boiling point before the end of the year. 
       
       "We are fully prepared to defend ourselves," he said. The company has been coached on strategy
       by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other privacy groups. 
       
       Hill recognizes that the advent of the Freedom Network will make the job of law enforcement
       officers much harder. 
       
       However, he points to successful cases against child pornographers that are developed by officers
       going undercover. "That's the way it will have to be done," he said, advocating a return to the days
       before wiretaps. "Policing is only easy in a police state."

      Wound-Up DefCon Winds Down
      by Polly Sprenger 
      
      3:00 a.m.  12.Jul.99.PDT
      LAS VEGAS -- The seventh annual DefCon hacker convention drew to a close Sunday, after a weekend of uninterrupted sensory overload. 
      
      The event was marked by massive enthusiasm over the release of a new remote administration tool from the much-heralded Cult of the Dead Cow,
      and the quizzical expressions on the faces of the media as they attempted to grasp "the meaning" of DefCon. 
      
      The CDC presentation featured a maelstrom of digital effects and technomusic that captured the energy of the three-day event.

      Inside the Virus Writer's Mind 
      
      
      ABCNews.com's Michael Martinez presented a talk on the persistent rift between hackers and the press on Saturday. He provided a forum for
      hackers to confront a member of the tech media with questions like, "Since all these reporters want to learn to be hackers, why don't they just hire
      hackers to be reporters?" 
      
      Martinez said that hackers had difficulty getting mainstream media to understand their message and perspective because so often communication
      breaks down between the two groups. 
      
      "We know the how, the where, and the when," Martinez said. "But why? You complain that we don't get it, and we complain that you won't let us." 
      
      Sunday morning and afternoon sessions were punctuated with rousing rounds of "Spot the Fed," the annual DefCon game of outing federal agents. 
      
      Anyone identified as a Fed was brought up on stage for questioning. The suspected Feds, all of whom were more than willing to whip out badges
      after a few minutes of interrogation, were dressed almost universally in polo shirts and khakis, their crew-cut stiffness a striking contrast to their
      black-clad accusers. 
      
      The audience hurled questions at them like, "Does your office have a ban on Furby's?" and "What does Dana Scully [the fictional X-files agent]
      really look like?" One Fed lost all hope of going undetected by responding, "Never heard of him." 
      
      The day hit high gear with the release show for BO2K, or Back Orifice 2000, one of the few software announcements that required a sign posted on
      the door warning that the presentation might be dangerous to people with heart conditions. 
      
      Nineteen of the 20 revered CDC members were present on stage, the most ever assembled in one place. The group took an older-but-wiser tone in
      its reverberating remonstrations to the audience. 
      
      "Pick the cause before you pick the site you're gonna hack," the group advised, "and use a fuckin' spell checker!" 
      Despite their bullying tone onstage, members of the CDC said later they're encouraged by the new, younger members of the hacking community. 
      
      CDC members said they hoped the new rev of Back Orifice, released under the Gnu open source license, would encourage younger hackers to go
      back to the basics -- scripting code and exploring the technology themselves -- instead of using cookie-cutter programs. 
      
      "They look at us up on stage and look at what we're doing, and they know they can't stand up there for doing something stupid," said CDC's Grand
      Master Ratte, MC of the group's gospel-like presentation. 
      
      But it was another old-school hacker who caused the big scene Saturday. Carolyn Meinel, a favorite target of many in the DefCon crowd, obtained
      a press pass despite the efforts of several conference organizers. 
      
      When Meinel wandered into the press area (with a sticker on her back that said "owned"), a Canadian reporter began interviewing her about her
      relationship with the organizers, asking why she wasn't granted a more civilized reception. 
      
      Meinel was interrupted, then ejected, by conference staff. But not without a fight. It was good sport for the assembled journalists, although the
      Canadian reporter was appalled. 
      
      "They invite criminals to speak at their conference, but they deny a freelancer a press pass?" said David Akin, technology reporter for the National
      Post in Toronto. 
      
      Emmanuel Goldstein of 2600, the hacker quarterly journal and Web site, presented a nine-minute preview of his documentary about the arrest and
      imprisonment of Kevin Mitnick. 
      
      Goldstein said the documentary was intended to be a counterpoint to the upcoming film, Takedown, which Mitnick supporters say unfairly casts the
      hacker as more devious and damaging than he really was. 
      
      Goldstein's presentation was followed by a mysterious "social engineering contest," details of which must remain confidential, since Wired News was
      forcibly ejected from the room. 
      
      Although the weekend was tempered with the expected disagreements between old hackers and young hackers, the media, and even a
      much-publicized argument within the community itself, DefCon 7 was undoubtedly an event to remember.

       Dear Mr. Rouland:
       
       Thank you for your letter requesting us to furnish Internet Security
       Systems with a prerelease copy of Back Orifice 2000.
       
       We had come to expect that the letter would contain an offer of money or
       other merchandise.  At least, your subordinate intimated as much on 
       Internet Relay Chat.
       
       Nevertheless, we are gladly willing to provide you with the software you
       desire if and only if you will, in exchange, grant us one million dollars 
       and a monster truck.  This fee is not negotiable.
       
       Thank you for your time.  We eagerly await your reply.
       
       
       best wishes,

      Hype on Back Orifice 2000 Reaches Fever Pitch 


      contribued by Reid Fleming 
      
      With the BO2K launch just days away the articles on
      BO2K are flourishing. HNN was able to get a sneak
      preview of the product and we think it will live up to all
      expectations and then some. This is a highly polished
      professional looking product. It will give the remote
      control vendors some competition. 

      The antivirus industry is gearing up for a busy weekend
      as they try to figure out a way to detect BO2K. But
      since cDc is releasing source code under the GNU public
      license there will be hundreds of spinoffs as people
      create their own versions of BO2k. Each version will
      need to be detected seperately by the antivirus
      software. When will Microsoft and the industry learn
      that antivirus detection is not the solution?

      Hackers Take Microsoft to School
                   
      The makers of BackOrifice 2000, one of the
      most powerful hacker tools ever released,
      claim it's for our own good

      FROM WEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 1999
      It's the kind of thing bellboys have nightmares about ù
      an entire hotel full of hackers, messing with the
      computers, screwing up the phones and generally
      raising hell. That's the scene at DEF CON, an annual
      hacker convention held at the Alexis Park Hotel in Las
      Vegas. At last year's DEF CON a hacker group called
      the Cult of the Dead Cow released a program called
      BackOrifice that can completely take control of a
      computer over the Internet. This Friday DEF CON 1999
      kicks off, and the Cult of the Dead Cow is back with a
      new version of BackOrifice that's more dangerous than
      ever. Should we be grateful?

                  A little disingenuously, the Cult of the
                  Dead Cow released the original
                  BackOrifice as "a remote
                  administration tool," a simple way of
      operating a computer running Windows 95 or 98 from a
      distance over an ordinary Internet connection. While
      it's possible to imagine scenarios in which having that
      kind of power would be useful ù and there are
      legitimate applications that perform similar functions ù
      such a tool is obviously very much open to abuse.
      Say, for example, allowing a hacker (or, as malicious
      hackers are sometimes called, a cracker) to take over
      a machine, read your personal information, send e-mail
      under your name and then erase your hard drive.
      Fortunately, BackOrifice has certain weaknesses. It
      can only take over machines on which BackOrifice has
      actually been installed, and once installed, it's not that
      hard to detect and remove.

      According to its creators, the new version of
      BackOrifice slated for release on Saturday is more
      powerful than ever. It's tougher to detect, gives the user
      a greater degree of control over the infected computer,
      and works on Windows NT, the heavy-duty version of
      Windows used by most large businesses. While the
      original version of BackOrifice was a threat to small
      businesses and private users, BackOrifice 2000, as it's
      called, will affect a much broader and more vital sector
      of the world's computers.



      So why does the Cult of the Dead Cow claim they're
      doing it all for our own good ù and why do some
      computer programmers agree? To quote from the
      Cult's press release, "BackOrifice 2000 could bring
      pressure on [Microsoft] to finally implement a security
      model in their Windows operating system. Failure to
      do so would leave customers vulnerable to malicious
      attacks from crackers using tools that exploit
      Windows' breezy defenses." In other words, don't
      blame us, blame Microsoft for making a shoddy
      product ù now maybe they'll improve it. As one poster
      on a hacking bulletin board wrote, "I feel better
      knowing that at least these holes will be known
      publicly and raise some sense of awareness rather
      than in a closed private environment where exploitation
      could continue unfettered."

      Not everybody agrees, but you can bet that Microsoft
      ù currently at work on a new version of Windows
      largely based on NT ù will be downloading a copy of
      BackOrifice 2000 and studying it closely. As the Cult
      of the Dead Cow ù which claims to be one of the few
      hacker groups out there to include a female member
      ù puts it, "Information is a virus. And we intend to
      infect all of you."

      own product to combat the hacking tool

                                                                 MSNBC

      July 7 ù Computer security firms are bracing for a
      serious flare-up of hacker activity come Saturday
      afternoon. With great fanfare at a Las Vegas trade
      show, the hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow will
      release a new version of its Back Orifice tool. The
      software, which makes it easy for computer
      intruders to hijack Windows-based PCs connected
      to the Internet, will be freely available on the Net.
      Much mischief is expected to follow ù as is a
      ôfixö from the Cult itself.
      
      THE FIRST VERSION OF BACK ORIFICE, so
      named to poke fun at MicrosoftÆs Back Office product, was
      released in August last year at the annual hacking trade show
      called DEF CON. This yearÆs show starts Friday, with the
      release of Back Orifice 2.0 as the marquee event.
             Back Orifice usually arrives at a victimÆs computer as
      an e-mail attachment. Once the victim is tricked into opening
      the attachment, the software secretly installs itself and turns
      the victimÆs computer into a ôclient.ö Then, anyone with the
      other half of the Back Orifice software (the administrator
      tool) can control the victimÆs PC from anywhere on the
      Internet. The hacker can then stealthily do anything to the
      victimÆs machine that the victim could do ù even delete all
      the hard driveÆs contents.
             Back Orifice is at the center of one of the key debates
      in the security industry ù while the Cult maintains it
      produced the software to reveal security flaws in Microsoft
      products, and ultimately make them safer, Microsoft says
      thatÆs just a cover to legitimize hacking. (Microsoft is a
      partner in MSNBC.)
             The tool has been ragingly popular among hackers ù
      the Cult says it has been downloaded 300,000 times. And
      even though all anti-virus packages now detect the program,
      security firm ICSA Inc. says there are ôtens of thousandsö of
      machines that are currently infected, unbeknownst to their
      users. Peter Tippett, chief technologist at ICSA, said he
      knows of individual networks where hundreds of machines
      are currently compromised.
             According to the Cult, Back Orifice 2.0 has several
      enhancements. Chief among them, it now works on the
      Windows NT operating system. It also employs stronger
      encryption, which will reportedly make it harder to detect.
      And it is open source ù meaning it will be ôradically
      polymorphic,ö as hackers extend it and create their own new
      variations of the program.
             Anti-virus software companies plan to spend the
      weekend analyzing the new software and creating a defense
      that they can spread to clients. ThatÆs expected to take 24 to
      48 hours.
             ôItÆs good that itÆs being released on a weekend,ö said
      Dan Takata of Data Fellows. ôWeÆll have time to play with
      it. MondayÆs when I assume a lot of people will test it.ö
             For that reason, software vendor Internet Security
      Systems Inc. asked Cult members for a pre-release version
      of the software. That way, clients could be protected before
      the product is released and a flurry of hacking followed.
             The CultÆs sarcastic reply: ôWe will gladly provide you
      with the software you desire if and only if you will, in
      exchange, grant us one million dollars and a monster truck.ö
             ôThat shows they have no other intent than
      maliciousness,ö said Jason Garns, MicrosoftÆs lead product
      manager for Windows NT security. ôUnfortunately, they
      view this as being a game.ö
             But Cult members say there are several good reasons
      not to give anti-virus vendors a leg up on Back Orifice. Chief
      among them ù Sir Dystic, who authored the first version of
      Back Orifice, is working on what might be called a
      competitive product: a security software package that will
      protect users from Back Orifice and many other security
      threats. The group declined to offer more details.
             ôWe did think about giving it to all the AV vendors,ö said
      a group member identifying himself as Tweety Fish. ôBut itÆs
      a method of defense we donÆt support.ö Anti-virus software
      only reacts to known security threats; since Back Orifice is
      open source, many variants are expected, so the group
      believes most AV software will be ineffective anyway. 

             ôWe will be releasing tools at DEF CON or in the near
      future which we believe will provide a much more robust
      method of protecting your system than what the AV vendors
      can do today,ö Tweety Fish said. 
             Also, if virus protection defeated Back Orifice
      immediately upon release, the tool would get no media
      attention.
             ôIt would dilute our press message,ö said Reid Fleming,
      who wrote the sarcastic e-mail to ISS.
             That message, according to media-savvy Cult members,
      is that Windows NT is fundamentally flawed.
             Cult members describe Back Orifice as a remote
      administration tool, useful for network administrators to
      update software on user desktops. But software companies
      say thatÆs a smokescreen, and point out that the tool runs
      secretly, in the background.
             The Cult counters by saying Microsoft, trying too hard to
      simplify operating system administration, has created security
      holes. Windows shouldnÆt allow a program to run secretly in
      the first place, the Cult says.
             ôIf Microsoft wasnÆt so committed to hiding the real
      workings of desktop machines from users, it wouldnÆt be a
      problem,ö Tweety Fish said. ôMicrosoft is taking a complex
      problem of network and server security and trying to simplify
      it without acknowledging the consequences of that.ö
             Still MicrosoftÆs Garns points out that ill-intentioned
      ôremote administration toolsö can be designed to attack any
      operating system and have existed for the Unix operating
      system for 20 years. 
             ôThereÆs nothing fundamentally unique about whatÆs
      happening here. It does not take advantage of any security
      vulnerability in Windows NT. It attacks people, not
      technology,ö he said. ôIt was not created for the benefit and
      benevolence of users.ö
             Chris Rouland of ISS agrees the program was clearly
      designed with ill intentions.
             ôIt offers live video capture of the screen.... We
      understand you can even remotely fake a blue screen so the
      computer looks like itÆs crashed, but you can keep operating
      in the background,ö Rouland said. ôIt sounds like itÆs going to
      be a pretty malicious piece of code.ö
             It is not yet known how Back Orifice will spread, though
      it most likely will be hidden inside one of several programs
      that will be e-mailed as an attachment. There are likely to be
      several variations, so virus companies urge Net users to
      exercise the standard caution when opening e-mail
      attachments. Users should also update their anti-virus
      software after detection for Back Orifice 2.0 is included,
      probably Monday or Tuesday.

      New and improved Back Orifice
      targets Windows NT 

      July 7, 1999
      Web posted at: 10:36 a.m. EDT (1436 GMT)

      by Tom Spring 

      (IDG) -- In the consumer world,folks like Ralph Nader fight for
      consumer rights by helping pass tough consumer protection laws.
      Then there's the PC world. 

      For us, there's a self-proclaimed equivalent: Groups of (mostly
      teenaged) hackers basking in the glow of computer monitors, who
      release nasty computer bugs under the guise of strong-arming
      software makers to get tough on privacy and security. 

      "We want to raise awareness to the vulnerabilities that exist
      within the Windows operating system. We believe the best way
      to do this is by pointing out its weaknesses," says a member of
      the hacker group the Cult of the Dead Cow who goes by the pseudonym Sir
      Dystic. 

      The Cult of the Dead Cow created and released the program Back Orifice
      last year to the general public at the Las Vegas hacker and security
      conference DEF CON. The program allows its users to remotely control
      victims' desktops, potentially undetected. 

      At this year's conference, on July 9, Sir Dystic says the cult will outdo itself
      and release Back Orifice 2000. The program, he says, is smaller, nimbler, and
      twice as nefarious. 

      Computer security experts question the Cult of the Dead Cow's intent. Releasing
      a hacking tool like Back Orifice 2000 in the name of safeguarding computer privacy
      is a bit like the American Medical Association infecting cattle with the deadly e.
      coli bacteria to inspire food companies to sell healthier meats. 

      New and Improved

      Unlike earlier versions that affected consumers and small businesses, Back Orifice
      2000 hits large organizations because it runs on Windows NT systems, which are more used
      by businesses. Also, the updated program is modular, so users can add additional functions.
      For example, they could hide files or activate a computer's microphone for real-time audio
      monitoring, according to Cult of the Dead Cow. 

      Back Orifice 2000 will also be more difficult to detect via network monitoring programs,
      according to Sir Dystic. This is because the program can communicate back to the sender
      by using a variety of different protocols, making it hard to identify. The group also says
      it will make the source code available for Back Orifice 2000, which will likely
      spawn multiple strains of the program in the hacker community, experts say. 

      Another purported function is real-time keystroke-logging, which can record
      and transmit a record of every keystroke of an infected computer. Also, the
      recipient can view the desktop of a targeted computer in real time. 

      It should be noted that PC World Online has no independent confirmation that
      new Back Orifice 2000 program actually lives up to the claims of Cult of the
      Dead Cow.

      Back Orifice 2000 not to be feared
      By Drew Ulricksen, ZDNet News
      July 12, 1999 2:41 PM PT


      LAS VEGAS -- Back Orifice 2000 is not
      something to be feared. It is not a virus. It is not
      a Trojan horse. It is a remote administration tool.

      Really. 

                           BO2K -- the Cult of the
                           Dead Cow's (cDc)
                           much anticipated
                           follow-up to Back
                           Orifice -- is quite
                           possibly one of the
                           most full-featured
                           remote admin tools on
                           the market today. 

      Combined with the aid of the new plug-in
      BOPeep, the tool -- which works on Windows 9x
      and NT machines -- enables system
      administrators to disable both the keyboard and
      mouse of the remote machine, and begin
      controlling it from their own PC.

      Sys admins can even fire up a video window of
      the remote PC so they can see what's on the
      monitor -- similar to PC Anywhere or VNC
      functionality. 

      BOTool, a plug-in shortly to be released by
      L0pht Heavy Industries, another hacker group,
      will allow the client to view and edit the file
      system and registry of the remote machine in a
      interface similar to the Windows file manager
      and regedit programs. 

                         Among many other
                         features, BO2K comes
                         with a built-in proxy server
                         and a Web server. The
                         U.S. version comes with
      3DES strong encryption, but the international
      version uses a weaker encryption scheme.

      According to cDc's DilDog (cDc members are
      only identified by their handles), BO2K was
      written from the ground up with security in mind.
      Strong encryption ensures all data and text will
      be transferred securely to prevent someone
      sniffing your password while you're remotely
      administering a PC. 

      BO2K weighs in at only about 115KB in size
      and utilizes only about 2MB of RAM. It is no
      CPU hog, either. Not only that, according to
      DilDog, the file transfer speed in BO2K is faster
      than any remote admin tool against which it was
      benchmarked.

      The price is right
      What do you expect to pay for something like
      this? $40? $60?

      Nope. Try $0. 

      Besides being free, B02K is
      also open source, so if you'd
      like to strip out or add
      functionality, go right ahead,
      just make your code available.
      But if you'd rather not dive into
      source code, there's also the
      option of just writing a plug-in
      to pop in. 

      Adding to the package is
      BO2K's customized setup.
      The original Back Orifice
      installed itself automatically as
      soon as it was run. BO2K
      launches, of all things, a
      Wizard to configure the setup.

      No longer is there a default port and password --
      in BO2K you must assign it a port and
      password, or it won't run.

      That means there won't be a widespread
      epidemic of script kiddies scanning the entire
      net for port 31337, looking for people infected
      with BO2K. 

      Software doesn't kill data ...
      "But it can run hidden, that's evil!" you say? It can
      run hidden, this is true, but this time around it
      can also run visible if you so choose.

      Many other software packages out there have
      the same option, and they even call it a feature.
      Believe it or not, some people even like it. 

      There are dozens of software packages out
      there that, if installed with malicious intent, allow
      an attacker to do just as much damage as
      BO2K could, if used improperly.

      You won't see many of those programs being
      killed by anti-virus software, and it's a shame
      that there's almost a sure bet Back Orifice 2000
      will. 

      If common sense is used, you won't need to
      worry about BO2K or any other software being
      run maliciously on your machine. Just
      remember, software doesn't kill data -- people
      do.

 07.0 CIA Not Breaking Into Banks 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/ 


      contributed by solvant 
      On July 5th, 1999 the Associated Press and Sidney
      Morning Herald Internet edition ran a month old already
      debunked article describing how the CIA will be
      electronically breaking into various banks around the
      world to retrieve Solobadon Milsovics hidden money.
      This claim was originally made by Newsweek magazine
      on May 24th and was later picked up and ran by the
      Reuters News Service. HNN immediately questioned
      these claims. MSNBC also raised questions about the
      original article. By June 7th, William Arkin of the
      Washington Post had gathered enough evidence to
      completely debunk this story. Now, over a month after
      the original false report the Associated Press and
      Sydney Morning Herald blindly rerun the story without
      bothering to verify its accuracy. Did they just want to
      create sensationalism? Did they think people would not
      notice? Lets say this one last time: The CIA does not
      employ 'hackers' to break into foreign banks!

      Hackers on stand-by as CIA finds Milosevic
      cash 
      
      The CIA believes it has traced banks in Greece, Cyprus and Russia - all
      traditional allies of Serbia - where President Slobodan Milosevic has salted away
      millions of dollars during his 10 years in power.
      
      United States Government computer hackers have been ordered to break into
      Mr Milosevic's foreign bank accounts and drain his hidden fortune as part of a
      clandestine CIA plan to overthrow the Yugoslav president.
      
      The controversial operation - opposed by some senior political and intelligence
      figures in Washington - is part of a covert six-point package authorised by Mr
      Clinton last week and reported in the Herald in May.
      
      Although details of the White House plan are secret, it is understood that CIA
      agents in the three countries would first visit the banks, set up new accounts and
      see how they operate. Using that information, National Security Agency hackers
      would then find a way round elaborate computer security systems to access
      accounts in the name of Milosevic and his family and siphon off the contents.
      But some intelligence officials fear the move against the Serbian leader's millions
      could backfire on the US by making its computer system a target for freelance
      hackers selling their skills to Washington's enemies.
      
      The other parts of the plan include funnelling cash to anti-Milosevic politicians in
      Serbia, giving money to newspapers and radio stations opposed to the Belgrade
      regime and making contact with Yugoslav military commanders thought to back
      a change in leadership. - The Telegraph, London

      Network Solutions Cracked
      by Oscar S. Cisneros 

      1:45 p.m.  2.Jul.99.PDT
      Network Solutions was reeling Friday from an attack on its Web servers that
      redirected users visiting its Web site to other locations. 

      "The FBI and Network Solutions are cooperating in determining the location"
      of the attack, said Network Solutions spokesman Brian O'Shaughnessy. 

      "It was a DNS modify that was sent through the system that was
      accomplished by spoofing." 

      He means that the IP addresses for Network Solutions servers were altered in
      the domain name system servers with a falsified template, so that Web browsers
      requesting the sites were instead sent to the IP address of another site. 

      Network Solutions fixed the IP address Friday morning, but the changes will take
      some time to reach the domain name servers spread across the Net. 

      Until that "emergency zone release" propagates, users visiting three Network
      Solutions sites -- Networksolutions.com, netsol.com, and dotpeople.com -- may be
      redirected to the Web sites of the  Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
      and Numbers and the Internet Council of Registrars (CORE), he said. 

      It is unclear exactly how long the crack has been in effect. 

      "We are aware of the problem and have been looking into it for a while," Scott
      Hollenbech, a Network Solutions staffer, in an email to CORE early Friday morning. 

      O'Shaughnessy said the source of the attack originated at a computer owned
      by SoftAware, an ISP located in the same building as ICANN in Marina del Rey,
      California. The attack was either done through physical or virtual access to one
      of their machines. 

      "We've corrected it," O'Shaughnessy said. "It should take about 24 hours before
      everything's resolved." 

      Jim Rutt, CEO of Network Solutions, said that investigators were working with
      preliminary evidence only and that the perpetrator has covered his tracks well. 

      "It is easy to leave a breadcrumb trail," he said. It is a famous hacker trick" to
      launch an attack behind multiple servers. 

      But Patrick Greenwell, Internet architect for DSL provider Telocity, said the blame
      might lie elsewhere. 

      "NSI could be culpable in that they have not pushed for the implementation of DNS
      Sec, which is a security measure for these types of things," he said. "It
      requires authentication." 

      Greenwell said that his analysis was based only on what little preliminary
      information was available, but that he believed the fault could largely be pinned
      on the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon,or BIND. 

      BIND is an implementation of DNS protocols, which Greenwell said are
      inherently insecure. Because the software operates on the vast majority of DNS
      servers across the Internet, upgrading it would be difficult to do while maintaining
      backward compatibility. 

      While it's unfortunate that this happened, I don't think it would be fair to point the
      finger at NSI," he said. "DNS is an inherently insecure protocol." 

      "This has nothing to do with BIND," O'Shaughnessy said. 

      Domain name addresses can be authenticated through varying levels of
      security, from a simple email method, to a password-protection scheme, to powerful
      PGP encryption. 

      O'Shaughnessy said he could not immediately determine what method of
      security Network Solutions uses to secure its own domain name data. 

      O'Shaughnessy added that the attack was reminiscent of one carried out by
      Eugene Kashpureff, who pleaded guilty in March of 1998 to one count of computer
      fraud for exploiting an NSI security hole. 

      The Internet Council of Registrars, one of five registrars participating in the initial
      test period for domain competition, posted a statement on its Web site
      saying that it "strongly condemns these acts and may take legal action against
      the perpetrators." 

      ICANN also condemned the crack as "an attempt to undermine the stability of the
      domain name system." The group has said it will cooperate with any investigation
      into the matter. 

      The FBI could not be reached for
      comment.

     NSI's Web site hacked 
     By Courtney Macavinta
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     July 2, 1999, 12:15 a.m. PT 

     update Hackers struck major linchpins in the Internet's address system today, redirecting Network Solutions visitors to
     one of its future ".com" competitors and the new body in charge of managing the Net's technical functions, crippling
     that site too, according to NSI executives.

     The world's dominant domain name registrar, NSI discovered that its various sites were down about 2 a.m. PT today and that they
     were automatically sending surfers to a hopeful registrar, the Internet Council of Registrars (CORE), and the Net's new
     administrator, the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

     NSI's main site still appears to be malfunctioning, although the company said its system has been restored. ICANN's site also
     was inaccessible this morning, possibly due to increased traffic from NSI's visitors.

     ICANN also runs the Net's "L root" server, one of the 13 servers that comprise the worldwide network, but its technical
     administrator said there was no indication so far that ICANN's systems had been hacked too.

     "It was a hack. We're investigating it, and the FBI is involved," NSI spokesman Brian O'Shaughnessy said. "The FBI told us that
                           they are on their way to the ICANN's building in Southern California now to secure the servers
                           because there could have been a hack on their end."

                           Specifically, the FBI is looking into an Internet service provider located in the same Marina Del Ray
                           building as ICANN, SoftAware, which NSI says--based on its initial investigation--appears to be the
                           launching pad for the hack.

                           The Commerce Department and other international governments have anointed ICANN to administer
                           the Net and to trigger competition in domain name registration, which Network Solutions has
                           dominated since 1993 under a U.S. government contract. Both entities are responsible for the Net's
                           most critical function: the domain name system that allows online users to call up Net and
                           e-commerce sites by typing in names ending in ".com," ".org," and ".net."

                           The hack is a sober reminder of the Web's vulnerability, even among companies and government
                           agencies equipped with state-of-the-art security technology. Government entities from the White
                           House to the National Weather Service have come under a rash of computer system attacks in
     recent months.

     In July 1997, a hack redirected NSI visitors to a site called AlterNIC, which aimed to compete with Network Solutions by offering
     alternate domains, such as ".ltd," ".sex," and ".med." AlterNIC's founder, Eugene Kashpureff, who exploited a security hole to
     "hijack" NSI's site, pleaded guilty in March 1998 to one count of computer fraud in the incident.

     Most of the 5 million domain names registered by NSI have been facilitated through its partners, such as Internet access
     providers. But of the approximately 10,000 names registered per day, about 3,000 are registered through NSI's own site. And at
     $119 for a two-year registration, the company could potentially lose thousands of dollars for the time that it was not in operation.

     CORE, one of five initial organizations chosen to compete with NSI directly by tapping into its registration system, alerted site
     visitors about the hack and said it would pursue its perpetrators.

     "These problems seem to be the result of illegal acts by hackers," CORE stated. "CORE strongly condemns these acts and may
     take legal action against the perpetrators."

     Today's hack will no doubt fuel the fire for legislation to improve computer security, such as the House Science Committee's
     Computer Security Enhancement Act, which was introduced yesterday.

      Web sites operated by Network Solutions Inc. were hit by hackers Friday who redirected visitors to one of the company's competitors. 

      Starting before noon Eastern time, NSI officials discovered hackers were automatically sending its site visitors to the the Internet
      Council of Registrars -- or CORE -- as well as the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers. ICANN is the new non-profit
      organization that oversees the Internet's address system. 

      After it discovered the hack, CORE placed a message on its Web site notifying visitors of the hack which also listed the correct IP
      address for Network Solutions' site. CORE also posted a brief statement saying it strongly condemned the moves and is looking into
      legal action. 

      ICANN officials said there had been no indications that the hackers had affected the root server that it administers. One of 13,
      ICANN's root server contains the database that allows domain names to be translated into IP numbers so that traffic can be properly
      routed. 

      NSI released a statement Friday afternoon confirming a hack had occurred and said the FBI had been called into investigate. NSI is
      speculating that SoftAware, an Internet service provider based in the same California building as ICANN, was where the hack
      originated. 

      In April, ICANN named five testbed registers which included CORE, America Online Inc., France Telecom/Oleane, Melbourne IT and
      register.com. They were the first to begin registering domain names and testing the new shared registration system developed to allow
      multiple competitors to handle the process. In addition, 29 companies have been accredited to register domain names once the system's
      test is complete. 

      ICANN takes over the system from NSI which was granted an exclusive government contract to manage the domain system in 1993.

      Israeli police hold blind brothers in sensitive computer break-ins
      Geniuses allegedly hacked into spy agency
      without special equipment

      MATTHEW KALMAN
      Special to The Globe and Mail
      Friday, July 2, 1999

      Tel Aviv -- Three blind Arab brothers are facing charges for allegedly hacking into some of Israel's most
      sensitive computer systems.

      The three young men allegedly broke into the computer systems and telephone switchboards of scores of
      Israeli institutions, including the Mossad intelligence agency and the Shin Bet security service.

      Muzher, Munzer and Shadi Budair, from the village of Kafr Qasem, appeared in Tel Aviv district court
      yesterday and are being held in custody on charges related to computer theft. Police allege that the brothers
      listened in on sensitive telephone conversations, intercepted classified information and passed it on to the
      Palestinian Authority and military intelligence officers from Egypt and Jordan.

      The brothers, each born blind, are reputed to be computer geniuses. Police said they were amazed to discover
      during a search of the Budair home last month that none of their equipment included special tools for the blind.

      The brothers have refused to co-operate with the police and deny all allegations against them. They are
      represented by lawyer Avigdor Feldman, who has defended many security prisoners, including Mordechai
      Vanunu, jailed 12 years ago for giving away Israeli nuclear secrets.

      Mr. Feldman said most of the evidence against the Budairs has been classified as "secret material" and he still
      doesn't know all the details of the charges.

      The prosecutor told the court yesterday that he intends to summon more than 165 witnesses to give evidence
      against the brothers.

      Police suspect them of stealing thousands of dollars worth of telephone calls abroad on behalf of friends calling
      the Persian Gulf states. They are also suspected of making thousands of dollars worth of illegal purchases by
      way of the Internet and by hacking into the computer systems of Israel's television shopping channel.

      According to sources close to the interrogation, Muzher, 23, and Munzer, 22, have in the past few years visited
      a number of Arab countries, where they contacted security and military officials and offered to share
      information gleaned from hacking into the computers of some of Israel's most sensitive security bodies,
      including the Mossad.

      The youngest brother, Shadi, is described as a minor under the age of 18, although his exact age is unclear. He
      faces charges of obstructing justice.

      Police Detective David Osmo, the officer in charge of the investigation, alleged that the brothers had been
      involved in illegal activity since at least 1996.

      "They have unique technological ability and knowledge and a complete mastery of communications and
      computers," he said. "Their skill has made it all the more difficult to collect the evidence against them."

      Their mother, Halima, said her sons had done nothing wrong. "I'm sure of their innocence," she said. "They are
      at home 24 hours a day and have never broken the law. I know my sons very well. This is not the first time that
      the police have raided our home. This time, they confiscated all the cellular phones and the computers. I believe
      they are doing this only because we are Arabs."

      Relatives of the Budairs say the three young men have been the target of repeated police arrests over the past
      four years.

      Kamel Issa, a teacher from the village school where Munzer and Muzher studied, described the brothers as
      "very ambitious young men with a remarkable influence on others."

      He said they invented a secret language, intelligible only to them.

 12.0 FBI Opens Seattle Computer Crime Squad

      The FBI's Seattle office has created the eighth special
      Computer Crime Squad, following New York, San
      Francisco, Dallas and Boston. The Seattle office will be
      staffed by 10 agents to focus on computer crime. FBI
      agents have been receiving training locally and in

      and software intended to identify and track malicious

      FBI, feds declare a war against
      computer crimes 

      by Charles E. Brown 
      Seattle Times staff reporter 

      The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Seattle office and the U.S.
      Attorney's Office here are teaming up to fight computer-related
      crimes - everything from Internet fraud to hacking to spreading
      computer viruses. 

      The Seattle FBI office has put together a team of 10 agents, some
      reassigned from other FBI work and others newly added, to focus
      on computer crime. 

      "We've had an increase in (federal) resources to start this new
      squad," said Dana MacDonald, who has been charged with
      overseeing the team's daily operations. 

      "We believe the wave of the future in criminal cases involves
      computer crimes, and we're trying to address that," said
      MacDonald, who has been supervising investigations of bank fraud
      and economic crimes, including computer crimes, in the Seattle
      office. 

      For more than a year, agents have been receiving special training
      locally and at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., to operate the
      newly purchased hardware and software needed to identify and
      track criminal activity. 

      "Emerging technologies in the computer field have mandated more
      specific training," MacDonald said. 

      In the U.S. Attorney's Office, two assistant attorneys - Stephen
      Schroeder and Floyd Short - have been assigned to be computer
      and telecommunications coordinators. 

      Short says they will remain in the fraud and white-collar-crimes
      division of the office, but the bulk of their duties will involve
      prosecuting computer-related crimes brought to them by federal
      law-enforcement agencies. 

      "It's an anticipation by our office that we're going to get a lot more
      cases presented to us involving computer crimes," Short said. 

      New York and San Francisco have had specialized teams in their
      FBI offices for two or three years, but more have been added
      recently, including in Dallas and Boston. Seattle's will be the eighth
      such team in the country. 

      MacDonald said the FBI team is prepared to assist in cases where
      computers facilitate crime, such as in child pornography,
      drug-dealing or financial crimes. 

      At a more sophisticated level, the unit will investigate intrusions into
      computer networks, sometimes pulled off by recreational hackers,
      but more commonly by disgruntled employees with access to
      corporate computers. 

      The Seattle team could also be called upon as part of a larger
      response to cyberterrorists intent on pulling off the electronic
      equivalent of the World Trade Center bombing. 

      Instead of targeting buildings, dams or planes, such terrorists could
      attack power grids, military defense, financial institutions or
      telecommunications systems.

      Hacker gets time in prison 
      Former airman downloaded porn 
     
      By NATALIE PHILLIPS
      Daily News Reporter 
     
      A former Elmendorf airman was sentenced to 10 months in prison
      Thursday for using his home computer to hack into the U.S. Air Force
      base's computer system and for downloading child pornography from the
      Internet. 
     
      "I don't consider myself a criminal," 27-year-old Michael Scott Moody told
      District Court Judge James Singleton during his sentencing Thursday.
      "Honestly, at the time, I didn't consider it hacking. I thought of it more as a
      prank," he said. "I was curious to know if I could access the computer at
      work. Being a government computer, I considered it a challenge. It worked.
      I didn't meant to hurt no one." 
     
      Assistant Attorney General Dan Cooper cautioned the judge that all
      computer hackers use that line. 
     
      "This is the classic 'I did it for the challenge,' " Cooper said. "They all say
      they didn't mean to hurt anyone, it's always for the challenge. This breach
      of security cannot be underestimated." 
     
      Moody plucked notorious software called NetBus off the Internet and
      installed it on two Elmendorf computers he had access to at work, Cooper
      said. Hackers usually send NetBus to unsuspecting computer owners by
      e-mail and disguise it in the attachment of a computer game called
      Wack-A-Mole. In the computer world, this type of software is known as a
      Trojan Horse because it is not what it is seems and can be dangerous. 
     
      Once Moody installed the software, it allowed anyone with the knowledge
      of NetBus to access the Elmendorf computers, which contained personnel
      records and maintenance records for an F-15 squadron. 
     
      Moody is the first person in Alaska to be prosecuted for computer hacking,
      according to Cooper. Others cases are under investigation. 
     
      In a plea agreement, Moody pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of
      unauthorized access to a computer and one felony count of possession of
      child pornography. In exchange for his plea, the U.S. attorney's office
      dropped a charge of wire tapping, which stemmed from his using software
      to access computer keystrokes. "It's like eavesdropping on a computer,"
      Cooper said. 
     
      Moody was also placed on three years of probation and will be allowed to
      use a computer only at work. He is prohibited from accessing the Internet
      during his probation, and he had to forfeit his home computer. He had been
      in the Air Force about three years when he was discharged in the spring. 
     
      The Air Force's "intrusion detection system" detected a hacker in
      November. The system immediately alerted the Air Force Computer
      Emergency Response Team based in Sacramento, Calif. A team analyst
      then monitored the hacking as it occurred, according to the indictment,
      which was handed down the following month. 
     
      Thursday, Moody explained to the judge how he fell into misusing his
      computer. He said he got his home computer a year ago and once he
      became connected to the Internet, he began to explore. 
     
      "As most people do, when I got on-line, I started to search for pornography
      and started a file," he said. "I was only interested in adult pornography." 
     
      Eventually, Moody ended up in computer chat rooms. "People started
      sending child pornography, which I really didn't even think about until it
      happened," he said. "I did receive pictures that were obviously of very, very
      young, from age 1 up. It pretty much shocked me. I deleted it right away
      because there was no doubt in my mind it was illegal." 
     
      He saved some pictures of older children, but he said they were on ones
      that "at the time, I didn't know if they were strictly wrong." 
     
      He also was introduced to hacking. 
     
      "One day someone I was chatting with hacked my computer," Moody said.
      The correspondent used NetBus and instructed Moody on how it worked.
      The correspondent let Moody hack him in return. "It allowed me to open
      CD trays and move his mouse," Moody said. 
     
      Moody wanted to see how far he could go with the hacking software, so he
      loaded it onto two computers at work, then accessed them from his home
      computer. That's when he got caught. 
     
      When investigators seized his computer, Moody told them they would
      probably find child pornography on his hard drive. They did. Moody asked
      the judge for leniency. His attorney, Rich Curtner, pointed out that Moody
      suffered from depression and found "refuge in the strange world of the
      Internet." 
     
      Cooper told the judge that Moody has had his chance. 
     
      At age 19, Moody got into trouble for a credit card scam in which he got
      ahold of credit card numbers and used them to purchase electronic goods.
      He agreed to enter a program for youthful offenders that allowed the
      charges to eventually be erased from his record. Moody also has two
      letters in his Air Force file for infractions. 
     
      "He's not been a law-abiding citizen," Cooper said. 
     
      Moody said, "I know what I did was wrong, and I accept responsibility. If I
      have to serve two years, that is very small compared to what I have to live
      with the rest of my life: the shame I have caused my family."

      Hackers invade government
      computers for second time in
      two weeks

      July 3, 1999 
      Web posted at: 5:22 PM EDT (2122 GMT) 

      RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Computer hackers broke into a
      government Internet site for the second time in two weeks, a news agency
      reported Saturday. 

      The hackers, calling themselves "Resistence 500," gained access to the
      homepage of the Ministry of Science and Technology. They then redirected
      users to a site filled with criticisms of the government of President Fernando
      Henrique Cardoso. 

      On June 17, the same group hacked its way into the Internet site of Brazil's
      Supreme Court and the presidential palace, urging users to protest against
      Cardoso's economic policies. On both occasions, they did not damage systems
      or databases and their message was quickly removed. 

      Experts here say Brazilian hackers are typically young males who revel in the
      challenge of breaking into a government or corporate Web site protected by
      an expensive security system. Government officials say they are trying to
      identify the hackers. 

      To date, there have been no serious breeches like the one in neighboring
      Argentina when a 23-year-old computer science student broke into a Harvard
      University computer to gain access to U.S. military and NASA documents. 

      Last year, U.S. federal agents for the first time used a court order wiretap of
      a computer network to track down Julio Cesar Ardita, the son of a former
      Argentine military officer. 

      Ardita, who voluntarily flew to the United States to stand trial, was sentenced
      to three years of probation in Argentina and fined dlrs 5,000.

       Abstract 
       
            Usually, this column focuses on the technical side of computer security. In fact, people generally seek technical solutions for security problems. This month,
            Carole considers the human side to the computer security equation. After all -- what's the point of setting up secure firewalls and e-commerce sites if your
            help desk opens up a hole? (3,000 words) 
       
       
       
             hat is the weakest link of your computer system security? Your network connections? Dial-up lines? Firewalls? What about your people? Social
             engineering is still the most effective method for circumventing obstacles. My kids are geniuses at it. So, apparently, is Kevin Mitnick. 
       
       Why would someone considered by many to be the world's greatest computer hacker, resort to social engineering techniques rather than technical skills?
       Because they work. Technical security vulnerabilities may be patched, but humans are always vulnerable. 
       
       What is social engineering?
       Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into actions they would not normally take. Sometimes, this is quite necessary and serves a good
       purpose. Ambassadors use their knowledge of a particular culture to facilitate good relations. An effective manager learns the personality traits of her
       group to keep them motivated and productive. Children usually try to manipulate their parents -- and good parents are even better at it. Top salespeople use social
       engineering skills to discover a client's needs and the best way to present a product to that client. A skilled social engineer can manipulate people without them being
       aware of the manipulation. 
       
       People don't like to be manipulated. Just observe the reactions many people have when approached by a member of a door-to-door religious group or salesperson. Often,
       people from these groups use such obvious and aggressive techniques that the people they are targeting tune out everything they have to say. It isn't that the message or
       product is bad. It's just that no one wants to be sold to. 
       
       Basic human characteristics
       Theologians have attempted to define human characteristics as the Seven Deadly Sins (pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, covetousness and sloth) and the Seven Virtues
       (faith, hope, charity, fortitude, justice, temperance, and prudence). A good understanding of these human characteristics is fundamental to human manipulation. 
       
       Immunity factor
       While stereotyping isn't really fair, it is true that city people are often exposed to sales pitches and scams. How many of us have given money to someone who
       approached us on the street with a sob story only to see the same "desperate" person telling a similar story to someone else a couple of months later? Like anything else
       received in high doses over time, social engineering is vulnerable to progressive immunity. 
       
       Social engineering and the Internet
       Spam
       Spam is the door-to-door salesman of the Internet. With a rather crude sales pitch, it succeeds mostly in annoying people. However, because of the sheer volume of
       targets, it's successful enough to be used. I recently got spam with an interesting social engineering approach: according to its pitch, I have a secret admirer who
       purchased a gift certificate just for me (see "E-gift certificate"). 
       
       Virus 'hoaxes'
       You can always tell when a friend or relative has bought his or her first computer. Suddenly, your mailbox is full of "virus warnings" and chain letters that have gone
       around the Net a few thousand times. Why do newbies fall for this? Usually, it's because they haven't seen enough of this garbage to develop an immunity to it. I tend to
       feel obligated to educate the sender and everyone else in the mail header. I find it useful to reply with a standard "rant" (see "Stop the insanity"). 
       
       I don't know who wrote it, but it's humorous as well as informative. I have another response for chain letters, but it's pretty rude. If profanity doesn't offend you, send
       me mail, and I'll pass it on. 
       
       Real viruses
       For some strange reason, it seems that the same people who send out all the faux virus warnings are the most likely to download a real virus. Clearly, the authors of
       viruses are also social engineers. 
       
       Privacy
       Anyone who plays poker knows that the most important technique in the game is to observe the other players to determine their weaknesses while not betraying your
       own. On the Internet, information about a person or company can betray potential weaknesses to be exploited. Most security audits caution companies to protect internal
       network topology. While "security through obscurity" isn't a solution, the best practice is to not release any more information about your company (or yourself) than is
       necessary. 
       
       Unfortunately, the individual doesn't always have a choice. My parents, who live in Florida, found themselves inundated with ads specifically targeting Mercedes owners.
       Since they did not purchase their car from a dealer, they wondered how these companies discovered that they own a Mercedes. It turns out that the state of Florida was
       providing registration data to a third party (see http://www.hackernews.com/archive.html?012699.html). As e-commerce grows, privacy protection will become a major
       issue. 
       
       While individuals may demand that their personal information be protected and private, they often voluntarily give the same information away. Just offer something for
       "free" in return for a survey and see what people will tell you. What's alarming is that children, who are more susceptible to manipulation, may blindly provide personal
       information to anyone who asks. Not too long ago, I caught my son's friends completing a survey to send to everyone on its header list (see "Re: read and do it"). 
       
       A master at work...
       Kevin Mitnick is certainly not the only person to have used social engineering techniques to get into computer systems, but he is probably the most famous and was
       apparently very good at it. The following true story was relayed to me by Brian Martin, a security consultant assisting Kevin Mitnick in his defense. 
       
            Kevin worked in an office in Denver doing basic computer admin stuff. During his time there he was poking around the Net, but more so he was
            calling various companies -- testing the limits of what he could do. 
       
            One night he left work while it was beginning to snow and had to walk five or so blocks to get home. Using a cellphone, he called a
            directory-listed 800 number to a large cellular company. By the first block, he had obtained an unlisted 800 number to the engineering
            department of this company. 
       
            Just after the second block he was talking to one of their engineers about source code to a cellphone. By the third block he was giving this
            engineer the login and password to an account at an ISP near him (in order to FTP files to him). 
       
            He passed the fourth block and hung up with the engineer, confident he was receiving proprietary source. When he arrived at home, cold and
            damp from the light snow, he found the full proprietary source to a cellphone made by one of the largest electronics companies in the world. 
       
            Five blocks, a cellphone, and a directory-listed 800 number. 
       
       Countering social engineering attacks
       Education and policy 
       Social engineering attacks are very hard to counter. In fact, I've had audit agreements that specifically stated that social engineering attacks weren't to be used. The
       problem with countering social engineering attacks is that it requires establishing appropriate policies and educating people -- two difficult tasks. Most people learn best
       from first-hand experience. Once it has been demonstrated that they are susceptible, people tend to be more wary. 
       
       It is possible to make people more immune to social attacks by providing a forum for discussion of other people's experiences. Not every New Yorker has to be mugged
       to know to be street smart. Stories about other people's misfortunes are enough to generate wariness. A good way to provide a forum is to establish an internal Web site
       with safety tips and information. Amusing stories tend to get the point across better and, of course, people love to hear about someone else's misfortune. This forum
       could also be used to report on virus hoaxes and real viruses. In fact, if you have this forum, you can make a policy statement that information about viruses is only to be
       distributed through this forum. 
       
       Technical solutions
       There actually are some technical solutions to the social engineering problem. The key is to limit the amount of information that is available -- just as a poker player
       would. Here are some things you can do to maintain the corporate "poker face": 
       
            Use an encryption package such as PGP for important documents or e-mail. 
       
            Do not advertise your internal network addresses. Often, sites configure their firewalls to hide internal addresses, but a simple bounced mail displays the internal
            addresses in the header. 
       
            Make sure your DNS configuration does not display internal systems to an external query. If possible, upgrade to BIND version 8, available from
            http://www.isc.org/view.cgi?/products/BIND/index.phtml

 17.0 Snooping OK on Pager Numbers?

      A new bill passing through congress will make it legal for
      the police to snoop on your pager without needing a
      judge to issue a court order. They will only be able to
      get at the numeric pager info which law enforcement
      argues is analogous to the billing info or "pen register"
      info they can now access without a court order. 

      They say it is not a "wiretap" so the rules for unlawful
      search do not apply. It seems just a few months ago
      congress was passing laws saying that pager and other
      data passing over the radio spectrum was protected.
      Congress wants it both ways. They want you to have
      privacy from everyone but the government.

      Snooping OK on Pager Numbers?
      by Declan McCullagh 

      3:00 a.m.  7.Jul.99.PDT
      
      WASHINGTON -- Police can easily "eavesdrop" on pagers if a bill approved
      by the US Senate becomes law. 

      The bill says law enforcement officials can monitor all messages sent to
      targeted pagers without having to convince a judge that the information can
      be found only in that way. 

      "Congress is trying to do an end run around the Constitution and gut the
      privacy of millions of pager owners," said David Banisar, author of The Electronic
      Privacy Papers. 

      The measure is part of a sprawling juvenile crime bill, which passed the
      Senate overwhelmingly after the Littleton, Colorado shootings. It isn't in
      the House version of the bill, and leaders from both chambers are scheduled to
      appoint conference committee members after the Fourth of July recess. 

      According to the legislation, judges will be required to approve police surveillance of
      numeric pager data without subjecting law enforcement requests to the more
      exacting current requirements of search warrants or wiretap orders. The rules
      governing alphanumeric pager monitoring are left unchanged. 

      "It makes the court into nothing more than a clerk," said Dave Kopel, a lawyer
      at the Independence Institute and a former assistant attorney general of
      Colorado. "The judge must issue the order based on a law enforcement officials'
      representation." 

      Devices to monitor whom Americans call and receive calls from already fit into this
      warrantless category and are frequently used by police. Government statistics say
      7,323 units -- called pen registers and trap-and-trace devices -- were used in
      1998. 

      The US Supreme Court ruled in 1979 that police didn't need a warrant to record
      what numbers a person dialed. "The installation and use of a pen register,
      consequently, was not a 'search,' and no warrant was required," the five-justice
      majority concluded. 

      The proposal's backers intend it to grant additional authority to law enforcement
      officials but, oddly enough, the US Justice Department has called it
      unnecessary. 

      "We are unaware of any law enforcement need for such authorization and believe
      that the proposal is unwise as a policy matter. The bill also raises significant
      constitutional concerns under the Fourth Amendment," says a May 1998 letter from
      the DOJ Office of Legislative Affairs.

      Another reason the DOJ gave was that criminals might simply switch to
      alphanumeric pagers, which the bill doesn't cover.Then how did this plan end up in a
      juvenile crime proposal? Senator Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) had previously
      introduced the pager interception proposal in 1997 and submitted it again
      this year as a stand-alone measure called the Clone Pager Authorization Act of
      1999. 

      DeWine couldn't be reached for comment during the recess. 

      During floor debate, the Senate started hanging irrelevant amendments on the
      juvenile justice bill as if it were a Christmas tree badly in need of some
      serious decoration. 

      One amendment creates a "national animal terrorism and ecoterrorism incident
      clearinghouse." Another requires Internet service providers to offer filtering
      software. DeWine's plan soon joined
      them. 

      "This legislation is yet another occasion where Congress responds to tragedy by
      uncritically passing anything and everything that has an anticrime label
      stuck on it," said Solveig Singleton, director of information studies at the
      Cato Institute.

      Illegal Communications Interception Equipment Was Destined for Vietnam
    
      7/9/99
      iDEFENSE 
      By Bill Pietrucha 
    
      Vietnam was the intended final shipping point for restricted U.S. communications intercept equipment, iPARTNERSHIP has
      learned. Shalom Shaphyr, arrested earlier this week for allegedly possessing and selling Tempest computer intercept
      equipment, planned to first falsify the nature of the equipment in export papers, ship it to a U.S. NATO ally, then to Israel, and
      finally to Vietnam. 
    
      The Tempest computer intercept equipment, also known as a video intercept receiver, is considered a defense article under the
      International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), and cannot be shipped to Vietnam without an export license. 
    
      In the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District Virginia late yesterday, Shaphyr, an Israeli citizen living in the U.S. under a
      business visa, requested his detention hearing be postponed until July 20, to give his lawyers "time to review the charges against
      me." 
    
      Shaphyr will continue to be held in the City of Alexandria, Va. detention center until the July 20 detention hearing date. 
    
      In papers filed with the court, FBI Special Agent Christian Zajac testified Shaphyr was "looking for a Tempest monitoring
      system" capable of remotely capturing computer emanations. The reason for the equipment, Shaphyr had said, was to view
      what was on a computer monitor from a distance of "a few tens of feet maybe to a few hundred feet" away. 
    
      Zajac, an FBI Special Agent for the past two years, told the court Shaphyr indicated the equipment would be used by the
      Vietnamese government "in a joint venture." Along with the equipment, Zajac told the court, Shaphyr also asked for a syllabus
      outlining the training that would be provided on the Tempest equipment, indicating the trainees would be Vietnamese. 
    
      Shaphyr, iPARTNERSHIP learned, operates a business with offices in Vietnam and England, and is an FAA certified pilot,
      flight engineer and navigator listing his address in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. 
    
      Zajac said the joint FBI-U.S. Customs Service investigation, which began in November 1998, led to Shaphyr's arrest this past
      Wednesday after Shaphyr paid an FBI undercover agent $2,000 in U.S. currency to export the Tempest equipment to Israel
      without a license. The total price Shaphyr allegedly agreed to pay for the Tempest equipment was $30,000, Zajac testified. 
    
      Zajac said the investigation did not end with Shaphyr's arrest, and is continuing.

      Serra to represent Mitnick on state
      computer charges 

      The Internet's super hacker, Kevin Mitnick, will be defended by flamboyant San Francisco criminal
      lawyer Tony Serra. 

      A master computer hacker, Mitnick has been been imprisoned since his 1995 arrest on federal and
      state computer-crime charges following an international manhunt. 

      Mitnick pleaded guilty to federal charges in April. He had been accused of breaking into computers,
      stealing software and computer passwords. With time served, he could be freed after his sentencing
      on the federal charges by the end of this year, said Serra associate Omar Figueroa. 

      Figueroa said Serra will be defending Mitnick against 1992 state charges that Mitnick violated
      California's computer crime law. Mitnick is accused of duping Department of Motor Vehicles workers
      into faxing confidential driving records to a copy shop in Los Angeles. 

      Figueroa said Serra would appear in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday to ask a judge to
      reduce Mitnick's $1 million bond. 

      At the time of his 1995 arrest in North Carolina, Mitnick was on the FBI's Most Wanted List.
      Mitnick has been the subject of several books. A movie about his exploits is due in theaters later 
      this year. 

      Serra was the inspiration for the 1988 film "True Believer," starring James Wood. He has defended a
      number of high-profile clients, including Black Panther leader Huey Newton. Figueroa said
      Mitnick chose Serra after the attorney won an acquittal for Eugene "Bear" Lincoln, a Native
      American charged with killing a Mendocino County sssheriff's deputy in 1995.

      This article questions whether or not vendors writing
      shoddy code or users not being diligent enough is to
      blame for systems being vulnerable. But there is no
      answer only users lamenting how complex the solution
      is. Of course vendors should be made accountable and
      are to blame. Why should users have to keep up on
      patches. As software moves into the home there is less

      'Always on' high-speed lines ripe for mischief 

      By Ted Bridis
      Associated Press 
      July 8, 1999

      WASHINGTON - Kevin Kelleher arrived for work at 8 a.m. one day to
      find a disturbingly familiar high-tech headache for the federal government:
      Hackers had vandalized the national weather Internet site he manages in
      Oklahoma.

      The hackers replaced important information about storms and tornadoes
      threatening the Midwest with a smirky taunt for Kelleher addressed to
      "mister admin person nice guy."

      So far, victims of these types of high-profile electronic assaults have included
      government agencies, the military and large companies on the Web. In a
      flurry of activity, hackers in recent weeks struck the White House, FBI, U.S.
      Senate (twice) and the Army's main Web site.

      And experts warn of an emerging threat to consumers from the next
      generation of technology: new high-speed connections to the Internet over
      cable TV or new digital phone lines that are permanently logged on.

      Higher speeds carry higher risks: Hackers even thousands of miles away
      could anonymously probe household computers over the Internet and
      rummage through private e-mail, documents and bank records.

      "It vastly and immediately multiplies the amount of poorly protected
      computers on the Internet ripe for the picking," said Lucas Graves, an
      analyst with Jupiter Communications, a research company in New York.

      Using these continuous Internet connections and "server" software included
      free on most new computers, families can publish up-to-the-minute photo
      albums online or retrieve computer files while traveling. Server software
      allows computers to "serve up" Web pages requested by other users. 

      But they may not realize the risks of leaving their digital doors unlocked. A
      Web site that tracks hackers, Attrition.Org, has recorded more than 1,465
      cases of vandalism this year.

      "As you get these machines in people's homes that are always on with a
      server, with pictures of their cat for grandma to see, that could be an issue,"
      said Cormac Foster, another Jupiter analyst.

      Scott Culp, Microsoft Corp.'s security manager for its Windows NT Server
      software, agreed that the industry needs to "educate consumers . . . and
      make sure they understand the risks associated with having a direct
      connection to the Internet."

      Hackers victimized Danny Sun of Walnut Creek, Calif., when they raided
      one of his continuously connected computers in May. They vandalized a
      Web site he runs as a hobby, but they also stumbled across - then published
      on the Internet - personal financial information that included his account
      number and balances.

      Sun later determined that hackers exploited a flaw in Internet software from
      the Allaire Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. The company warned customers
      about the problem months earlier on its Web site and in e-mail that Sun
      admits he ignored.

      "I get lots of mails from these manufacturers," Sun said. "Sometimes, I don't
      bother to read it."

      The Army apparently left the same vulnerability unrepaired - also despite
      warnings from the same software vendor - on its Web site, which a hacker
      vandalized last week.

      "It is very, very easy and takes very little time," a person who acknowledged
      being the hacker said in an online interview with the Associated Press.
      "Under five minutes if you don't poke around."

      "I couldn't believe it. I was just going through to check vulnerabilities and
      was like, wow!"

      Army spokesman Jim Stueve said only that a criminal investigation was
      under way.

      Experts argue whether to blame software companies for designing vulnerable
      products or victims who aren't diligent about installing patches and upgrades.
      Kelleher blamed his weather site's vulnerability on a faulty patch from a
      software maker.

      "The situation is getting so complex," he said.

      The dilemma for software makers, who usually send customers e-mail when
      they discover flaws, is made worse by hackers monitoring the warnings.

      Experts predict that software of the future will periodically check with its
      manufacturer, using the Internet for important upgrades.

      That type of technology could be a remedy for victims like Kelleher. It took
      52 hours, with only brief periods for sleep and food, to restore the
      government's weather site.

      "This ranks on the high-annoyance scale," Kelleher said after last week's
      repairs. "There's a lot of people spending a lot of energy trying to hack these
      systems. It's difficult to spend an equal amount of energy to protect them." 

               
 21.0 LSA can be crashed

      [ LSA Can be Crashed ]

      By Stea|_th : 4/06/99 4:56GMT

                                                                

      We have discovered that Windows NT LSA can be crashed by a remote attacker. The attack
      described below crashes Windows NT by hitting the LSA(Local Security Authority) system,
      and makes the target machine unusable after some period of time. The problem is caused 
      due a vulnerability in verifying  LsaLookupNames tag. It is made worse by the fact that
      it can be anonymously exploited. Btw, the  RestrictAnonymous (1) registry key does not 
      prevent this problem from being exploited. :)

      LSA Overview : [ The LSA is the system component responsible for authenticating users to
      the system, and deciding what access and privilege the users are entitled to. The same 
      process that contains the LSA also contains the SAM (Security Accounts Manager), as well
      as elements of the RPC subsystem, particularly those responsible for launching DCOM servers.
      Those components will also be unavailable as a result of the crash. Once the LSA has died, 
      new authentication tokens can no longer be created. Anything that requires creating new 
      authentication tokens will no longer function. ]

      There are some cases where the exploit results wont appear immediately, i ll try to describe
      some of the cases . If the host's exception system is not configured to work automatically, 
      then a dialog box will be displayed on the host, and the funny thing about it is that the system
      will work perfectly until the msg dialog is dismissed !. This  configuration is normally only 
      found on developer's machines. The registry key that controls this behavior is 
      HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
      NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug, its  value is "Auto". Changing this value from the default of "1" to
       "0" will enable this behavior. As documented in MS Knowledgebase article Q143474, setting the 
      following key value can help restrict many of the anonymous (null) SMB connections.It might sound
      crazy , but that value on the registry can also restrict many IIS-based FTP  attacks to your machine.

      Hacker takes on All-Star voting

      Associated Press


          BOSTON -- The last All-Star game of the 20th century nearly fell prey to late-millenium technology. 
          Chris Nandor heard in late June that Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra was 20,000 votes behind the New York Yankees'
      Derek Jeter in All-Star voting. So Nandor took advantage of Major League Baseball's newest way of voting -- via the Internet. 
          Nandor, 25, of Carver, Mass., went to work on a program that cast some 25,000 votes for Garciaparra, according to
      Wednesday editions of The Boston Globe. 
          On Monday, the American League announced its All-Star lineup, as voted on by fans. And sure enough, there was
      Garciaparra at shortstop, 20,446 ahead of Jeter. 
          As it turned out, Garciaparra won it fair and square. 
          Fans were allowed to vote 22 times on the Internet, the average number of home games for each team during the balloting.
      Nandor's attempt to vote 25,000 times was detected before it could be added to the tally, according to Alex Tam, director of
      Major League Baseball's web site. 
          "Between the 25th and 27th of June, 25,259 votes for Garciaparra were rejected," Tam said Tuesday night. "The same
      person also voted for (Scott) Hatteberg, (John) Valentin, and (Jose) Offerman." 
          It might have worked, but Nandor had attempted the ploy earlier in the voting period. 
          "We know all about him," Tam said, reeling off Nandor's name, address, age, place of employment, and computer number.
      "On May 19, he voted 14,702 times for Garciaparra. We caught all of them and filtered them out. 
          "Nothing is foolproof. But if you're talking about the average high-end hacker, we think we can catch them." 
          Nandor thought for a time he'd made the difference. 
          "Well, when I first heard he won, I wasn't sure, but I thought it could've been me," Nandor said Tuesday night. "But I also
      thought it could've been other people in addition to mine." 
          Nandor said he didn't do it just for kicks. 
          "I think in large part I did it just because the All-Star game was going to be in Fenway, so I felt Nomar deserved a start on his
      home turf, with the incredible season he's had. I still might have done it if the game had been in New York, but it makes me feel
      good to have this justification for my actions."

      This hack tried but couldn't connect 

      By Gordon Edes, Globe Staff, 07/07/99 

          T. PETERSBURG, Fla. - The worst suspicions harbored by Yankee
          fans were true. In an attempt to swing the close vote for the American
      League's All-Star shortstop in Nomar Garciaparra's favor, a 25-year-old
      computer hacker from Carver, Mass., cast around 25,000 votes on the
      Internet for the Red Sox star on the last day of balloting.

      But relax, Red Sox fans, your man apparently beat Derek Jeter of the
      Yankees fair and square. The computer police entrusted with sniffing out
      corruption did their job, according to Alex Tam, director of Major League
      Baseball's web site (mlb.com). Chris Nandor, who used a computer
      programming language to circumvent limits on how many times a person
      could vote on the Internet, was caught in the act, Tam said.

      ''Between the 25th and 27th of June, 25,259 votes for Garciaparra were
      rejected,'' Tam said last night. ''The same person also voted for [Scott]
      Hatteberg, [John] Valentin, and [Jose] Offerman.''

      Nandor, Tam said, had tried this once before. ''We know all about him,''
      Tam said, reeling off Nandor's name, address, age, place of employment,
      and computer number. ''On May 19, he voted 14,702 times for
      Garciaparra. We caught all of them and filtered them out.

      ''Nothing is foolproof. But if you're talking about the average high-end
      hacker, we think we can catch them.''

      Nandor, who didn't know his votes were thrown away until last night,
      thought he'd done a big favor for Garciaparra, according to Jon Orwant, a
      doctoral candidate at the MIT Media Lab and editor-in-chief of the Perl
      Journal, Perl being the computer programming language Nandor used in his
      attempt at chicanery in cyberspace. Orwant and Nandor are friends.

      ''I've examined his program and can confirm that it would have stuffed the
      ballot box,'' Orwant said in an e-mail message to the Globe, to whom he had
      indirectly provided a tip about Nandor's activities.

      ''These programs are easy to write with Perl. In broad strokes, the way his
      program worked is that it pretended to be a human being visiting the All-Star
      web site, where it would click on the appropriate buttons and fill in nonsense
      for the different fields (e-mail address, city, state, zip, etc.).''

      Major League Baseball rules limited Internet users to 22 votes, which
      equaled the number of times All-Star ballots were distributed in
      major-league parks. What prompted Nandor to weigh in with far greater
      numbers?

      ''A couple of weeks ago I was at Fenway with some people, watching the
      Red Sox go through an 11-run first inning against the White Sox, and we
      were having a great time and talking about all the different players, and the
      upcoming All-Star game,'' Nandor wrote in an e-mail message. ''Someone
      mentioned Nomar was falling behind. So I decided I would go home and try
      to help Nomar win.

      ''I think in large part I did it just because the All-Star game was going to be
      in Fenway, so I felt Nomar deserved a start on his home turf, with the
      incredible season he's had. I still might have done it if the game had been in
      New York, but it makes me feel good to have this justification for my
      actions.''

      But what apparently did in Nandor was a certain amount of laziness
      uncharacteristic of his hero, Garciaparra. In his first attempt, in May, Orwant
      said, Nandor used the same e-mail address. His last attempt, in June, he
      used the same phone number (111-222-3333) and Zip Code (11111).
      Nandor wrote that he set his computer to run repeatedly, then went to a
      barbecue.

      Because he didn't vary those basic bits of information, the systems
      administrators at CBS Sportsline, the Internet site that conducted the voting
      on the Web for Major League Baseball, caught on quickly, Tam said.

      ''Sportsline developed the ballots with numerous safeguards in place,'' Tam
      said. ''They look at all the results on any given day and scan for patterns.
      They also have a way to scan for Perl scripts. They were very well aware of
      him from Day 1, and blocked him out.''

      So instead of what could have been the worst All-Star voting scandal since
      1957, when Cincinnati fans voted eight Reds as starters on the National
      League team, leading commissioner Ford Frick to take the voting away from
      the fans altogether, MLB claims a clean election.

      Jeff Gehl is president of The Marketing Center, the counting house that
      tabulated the All-Star votes for Major League Baseball. TMC is based in
      Brookfield, Conn., with offices in Weymouth, Mass., and Newport Beach,
      Calif.

      Gehl said yesterday the Internet accounted for less than 20 percent of the
      vote. Most of the ballots counted in the last week were cast at WalMart and
      Pepsi-Cola outlets.

      ''There were several million ballots, and they were sent in one lump sum at
      the end of the program,'' Gehl said. ''We had three shifts working last
      weekend, processing the ballots.''

      Attention, WalMart shoppers: The brand of choice, evidently, is
      Garciaparra, who was in third place in the voting until the last batch of votes
      were counted.

      Orwant, for one, remains unconvinced that the system can withstand a clever
      hacker.

      ''If they claim their system is foolproof, they're wrong,'' he said. ''I'll prove it
      to them next year.''

       U.S. vulnerable to cyber attack
       By Robert Lemos, ZDNN

       LAS VEGAS -- Officials from the Clinton Administration, the U.S. Army and the U.S.
       Department of Justice laid out how the United States intends to protect its data from foreign and
       domestic attacks on Wednesday. 
       
                             While so-called "hackers" have garnered most of the fame for
                             attacking systems in highly visible ways, the officials stressed that
                             external threats were more serious. 
       
                             "We have a world now where several nations that are hostile to the
                             U.S., terrorists that are well financed, and even some organized crime
                             are developing techniques to attack our information infrastructure,"
                             said Jeffrey Hunker, senior director for infrastructure protection on
       the National Security Council. 
       
       Hunker spoke at the Black Hat Security Conference in Las Vegas to a
       collection of network administrators, security professionals, law enforcement
       and military personnel, and a few hackers. 
       
       Hunker said the administration believes that countries hostile to the United
       States -- yet, weaker militarily -- will instead attack the nation's information
       and Internet connections. 
       
       At present, the systems are to a great degree unprotected. "We depend on
       systems that were never designed with the protection of data from an
       organized threat," he said. 
       
       Phillip Loranger of the Army's Information Assurance Office agreed. "I would
       like to take all of .mil and make it an intranet," he admitted during a luncheon
       talk. "Currently, we have trouble keeping people out because we have too
       many gateways (to the Internet) and undefined backdoors into our systems." 
       
       Industry must take notice
       Industry needs to sit up and take notice, said NSC's Hunker. "The truth of
       the matter is that (the industry is the one that) owns the systems that are going to be the hardest hit
       -- not the federal government."
       
       Hunker outlined a 10-step plan for those companies with an "addiction" to insecure information
       systems.
       
       His recommendations included: Identifying vulnerabilities and fixing them; detecting threats and
       unauthorized intrusions; better communications between intelligence and law enforcement
       agencies; sharing warnings and information about intrusions; designing a system of response to
       information emergencies; enhancing research and development; reaching out to Americans to
       educate them on the need for cyber security. 
       
       Also, as part of the program, Hunker intends to start up a ROTC-like program to train college
       students in information security in return for service after graduation. Finally, the Administration
       official pushed for better legislation to support security efforts while protecting citizens' civil rights. 
       
       DOJ's cybercrime boom
       Michael Sussman, senior attorney with the computer crime/intellectual property section of the
       Department of Justice, added that the government is also improving its ability to prosecute cyber
       criminals, both domestically and abroad. "The computer crime office at the DOJ started out with
       two lawyers in 1991," he said. "Now we are approaching 40 quite fast."
       
       Despite the problems, Hunker said the government will not try to regulate the industry into being
       more security-conscious. "Late at night, I ask myself [whether we should regulate]," he said. "I am
       impatient. But in the U.S., it has been the insurance industry that has been a driver, and that may
       be the way [information security will go as well.]"

      Interesting report on an online banking scam. An
      attacker set up a mirror site to simulate the banks login
      screen. In doing so they were able to get the

      This is just one of many attacks on online banking. Even

      worked out the industry proceeds to move forward
      signing up customers and putting more of them at risk.

      Logging on to cyber-crime
      
      The old-fashioned bank heist is now just a few key strokes away - and almost invisible
      
      Tom Regan 
      Special to The Christian Science Monitor
      
                    Nothing seemed out of the ordinary when clients of the second largest bank in Holland logged on to the bank's Web site to access their accounts.
                    The first time they entered their username and password, however, they received an error message. When they tried again, they were able to
                    access their account, conduct their business, and leave.
      
                    What they didn't know was that the first time they were not actually at their bank site but at a mirror site set up by a hacker.
      
                    The mirror site took their information, e-mailed it to the hacker, then sent the clients to the bank's real site. A few hours later, the hacker went to
      the bank site and, using the stolen information, took five gilders (about $2.35) from each account - a sum most people would never miss. Doing this, the hacker was
      able to steal thousands of dollars, without the bank or its customers ever knowing.
      
      Luckily, the hacker wasn't a real thief - just someone who wanted to prove that the bank's claims of impenetrable security were nonsense. All the money was
      returned. But his actions show the new kinds of crimes that are taking place online, especially as many businesses rush to embrace electronic commerce, without
      making sure their online security is strong enough.
      
      "I don't think that we need to be so concerned about cyber-doomsday predictions," says Yael Sachs, president of Aladdin Knowledge Systems's Internet security
      unit. "But it's petty crimes like this one on a large scale that will impact our economies to a huge extent."
      
      
                                                        ILLUSTRATION BY BOB STAAKE 
      
      
      
      According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, the average bank robbery stole about $14,000, while the average computer theft was more than $2
      million. While the exact figure of financial losses due to cyber-crime is not known, most security experts interviewed for this article put it in the billions of dollars.
      
      For instance, AT&T and MCI were forced to give 38,000 consumers credits and refunds worth $2.74 million in 1997 for phone charges they unknowingly incurred
      when Internet scam artists hijacked their computer modems. The scam occurred when the victims visited a porn site and downloaded a plug-in to watch a video.
      While they were doing this, a vandal program (a rogue application that executes automatically when a user views certain kinds of Web pages or opens an e-mail
      attachment) logged them off without their knowledge and redialed their modems to connect to a 900 number overseas, for which they were later billed.
      
      In fact, cyber-criminals based in nations once a part of the Soviet Union are a growing problem for US businesses. In one recent case, two men from St. Petersburg
      hacked into a US bank's computer network and transferred $10.5 million from the bank's corporate accounts into accounts they controlled.
      
      "There's a lot going on out there right now," Ms. Sachs says. "Many businesses are driving on the information superhighway at 200 miles an hour without a seat belt
      or an airbag."
      
      "When I used to teach, I often told my students that if you want to steal $1 million, use a computer," says Harvey Kushner, chairman of the criminal justice
      department at Long Island University. "You get more, you're less likely to get caught, and if you are caught, you'll do less time."
      
      Professor Kushner says that computers have changed the face of crime. Much crime means some form of physical danger for the thief, and normally doesn't result in
      much ill-gotten gain.
      
      "But computers enable crimes of concealment and deceit. It doesn't require violence. Anyone with a computer and a little skill can become a cyber-criminal. Smart
      college kids sitting in their university dorms can steal enough money to pay for their education, for instance. Five dollars here, five dollars there. Unfortunately, they
      don't even think it's really stealing.
      
      "And it's a real challenge for the police. For 20 years, we've been training people to fight crime in a certain way. It used to be that bookies would keep all their
      records on rice paper that burned easily in case of a raid. So police had to barge in before the paper could be burned, and they were taught tactics to do that. But
      these days, to find that same information, you have to learn how to take apart a computer disk, or follow a vague cyber-trail, often across continents, just for a local
      crime."
      
      Kushner also says that Y2K is a real opportunity for cyber-criminals. The emphasis on solving Y2K problems means that important security concerns are being put
      on the back burner because of lack of funds, he says.
      
      
                                                        ILLUSTRATION BY BOB STAAKE 
      
      
      
      Another problem for those computer security experts is that many companies that are victims of cyber-criminals either have no idea that they have been robbed or
      are reluctant to make cyber-crimes public because it might hurt their growing electronic commerce operations.
      
      But steps are being taken to combat cyber-crime. In December 1997, US Attorney General Janet Reno and law officers from several countries agreed to develop
      high-tech solutions to combat computer crime and to prosecute criminals who cross borders to rob banks or sell child pornography in cyberspace.
      
      Then last November, the International Chamber of Commerce based in Geneva announced it was establishing a special unit to help companies around the world
      combat cyber-crime. The group works closely with Interpol to fight Internet crime. And the US Federal Bureau of Investigation has also established an elite unit to
      combat cyber-criminals and cyber-terrorists.
      
      But Sachs says the best thing that businesses of all sizes can do is act to protect themselves (see article at right).
      
      "People feel they have time. They say, 'We don't know anybody who has been hurt.' Well, I know lots of people who have been hurt," Sachs says. "Coming from a
      for-profit company, there is always the sense that you're just using scare tactics to promote your product. But people need to be aware of the scope and scale of the
      kind of activities taking place, or else they'll become victims as well."

      CYBER WARS
      
      Wars of the future... today
      
      The stealth battlefields of information warfare 
      
      Tom Regan 
      Special to The Christian Science Monitor 
      
                    For the past three generations of Americans, going to war meant images of Robert E. Lee on horseback, front page stories of a sharpshooting
                    Sergeant York, newsreel footage of Marines storming Guadalcanal, Walter Cronkite interviewing American GIs in Vietnam, or CNN's live
                    coverage of military operations during the Gulf War. 
      
                    But the wars of the future may not be so hands-on. Or so visible. Instead, they may be fought by "cyber-knights," young men and women who sit
                    at rows of computers at secret locations in the United States and can launch a barrage of cruise missiles from an unmanned naval vessel in the
                    Mediterranean, or release an Internet virus that will overload the power grid in Pyongyang, North Korea. 
      
                    There will be no news coverage of battlefields, because there may not be battlefields as we now know them. These wars may be more damaging,
                    but they will mean fewer casualties and quicker victories. 
      
      There is another side to this cyber-scenario, however. 
      
      As the US moves toward using information warfare, so do its opponents. In fact, many say that the more the US uses cyber-technology as a weapon, the more it
      exposes itself to cyber-attack by foreign governments, freelance hacker/terrorists and clever cyber-criminals. 
      
      In terms of conventional weaponry, the US dominates the global battlefield. With Russia reeling from economic and political catastrophes and China years behind in
      firepower (although recent events have shown that time window is much shorter than originally thought), there are no legitimate contenders for the US title of world
      superpower. 
      
      
                                                        BOB STAAKE 
      
      
      
      It's no wonder then that many foreign government and terrorist organizations view the Internet and other computer network systems as a way to balance the odds
      quickly and cheaply. 
      
      Yet there may be no choice but to move forward, as information technology becomes more and more important to the way the US, and the world, does business,
      relaxes, and defends itself. 
      
      Forewarned?
      
      Normally, forewarned is forearmed. In cyberspace, that isn't always the case. 
      
      Take the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade several weeks ago. Rage spread across China and hackers from the mainland attacked the Web sites
      of the US Departments of Energy and the Interior, and the National Park Service. A subsequent attack brought down the White House Web site for three days. The
      attacks generated headlines across the country. 
      
      What the news media didn't report was that the US government had known for a long time that someone had been in its computer systems - they just didn't know
      who. Then, in a fit of anger, the Chinese hackers caused some real damage - and gave away the hidden "location" of several "backdoors" they had built in US
      government networks. (See story on page 14 for explanation of "backdoors.") Now that this threat is known, most people might think it can be prevented from
      happening again. Not quite. 
      
      It's the foreign hackers who didn't lose their cool, say computer security experts, that everyone needs to worry about. These are the people who, at a time of
      conflict, will use still-undetected backdoors to gain entrance to government and military computers and corrupt or falsify strategic information. 
      
      Warfare at the speed of thought
      
      "There is a hidden war going on at this very moment to penetrate corporation and government sites," says Ed Roche of The Concours Group, an international firm
      that studies Internet security issues. 
      
      Many computer security professionals and academics, such as Dr. Roche, say we are entering a new age of conflict, one that will be fought over networked
      computer systems like the Internet. And the ways we engage in these conflicts will affect more than soldiers on the battlefield. This new form of conflict could
      dramatically disrupt daily life in the US - power grids, phone systems, commuter trains, airplane guidance systems, to name a few. 
      
      The US Government Accounting Office estimates 120 groups or countries have or are developing information-warfare systems. According to a report issued by the
      Center for Strategic and International Studies, 23 nations have cyber-targeted the US. 
      
      The National Computer Security Center reported last year that of "520 large US corporations, government agencies, and universities that responded [to their
      survey], 64 percent reported intrusions, up 16 percent in a year. The Internet was the main point of attack." 
      
      And while more attention is being paid to developing adequate security for government networks, private commercial networks may prove to be the roads through
      which an information-warfare attack is launched on the US. 
      
      Anybody can get you anywhere
      
      One reason for the problem is the speed at which the Internet has grown, Roche says. This rapid growth (which includes the rush to create e-commerce options for
      commercial Web sites and the movement toward just-in-time production that allows outside vendors access to a company's main computer network) has created
      holes faster than government and industry can close them. These holes can then be exploited by terrorists or foreign governments. 
      
      If, instead of attacking military systems and databases, an enemy attacked unprotected civilian infrastructure, the economic and military results would be disastrous,
      warned the 1994 Joint Security Commission's Report on Redefining Security. More than 95 percent of defense and intelligence community voice and data traffic
      uses the public telephone systems. 
      
      Attacks are already under way against both government and private computer networks in the US: 
      
           The US defense department acknowledges that its computer systems are attacked 60 to 80 times a day. Most security experts say that the real number of
           attacks is higher. 
      
           A private computer security firm hired by the US government found that a foreign nation had attempted to use computers to change the composition of tensile
           steel in an American steel-manufacturing plant. The aim was to cause the steel to crack when side stresses were placed on it during freezing conditions. 
      
           A baby-food manufacturer discovered by accident that one of the standard components in its infant food had been increased 400 fold - to toxic levels. The
           manufacturer was unable to find out who broke into its system because the attack came through a vendor integrated into the company's network.
      
      Also 1997's Operation Eligible Receiver demonstrated the potential vulnerability of the US government's information systems. The National Security Agency hired
      35 hackers to launch simulated attacks on the national information structure. The hackers obtained "root access" - the highest level of control - in 36 of the
      government's 40,000 networks. 
      
      If the exercise had been real, the attackers would have been able to create power outages across Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, and New York. They could
      have disrupted the Department of Defense's communication systems (taking out most of the Pacific Command) and gained access to computer systems aboard US
      Navy vessels. 
      
      It was a disturbing exercise. So much so, that several top White House officials have spoken of the possibility of an "electronic Pearl Harbor" attack on the US
      mainland. Added to these vulnerabilities is the fact that most Americans have no sense of how information warfare will affect them. 
      
      "When you think of cyber-warfare in terms of conflict, you have to broaden the context," says James Adams, head of Infrastructure Defense and author of 12 books
      on espionage and terrorism. 
      
      "In the past, we saw conflict as a range of things that happened terrestrially - terrorism on one end and global nuclear war on the other. That meant soldiers at the
      high end of conflict and civilians at the lower end. 
      
      "But in cyberspace," Mr. Adams says, "the front line has changed. All of us are now a part of the front line. The arena of conflict has widened, and it's not just those
      who are wired who are vulnerable. If a foreign government or a terrorist group takes out the New York power grid, it will affect those without computers as much as
      it will affect those with them." 
      
      If we want to see how much cyber-warfare has become a part of a country's arsenal, we need only look at the conflict in Kosovo, according to Adams. Serbia is a
      technology "have-not," while China is a technology "have." Yet both countries used the Internet to launch attacks on the US and NATO information structures. 
      
      "There are at least six nations right now who have active groups, paid by their governments, trying to formulate tools and procedures to cause computer terrorism in
      US corporations," says Jay Valentine, head of Infoglide, a database analysis company that works extensively with the US government. 
      
      "Those countries are Syria, Iran, China, India, Pakistan and Israel. [Other experts add France and Russia to this group.] Not all of them are bad guys, "Mr.
      Valentine says. "Some are doing it for defensive reasons, but they all have backdoors into American government computers. We have detected several 'software
      tools' which are used to erase 'computer fingerprints.' " 
      
      Not everyone, however, thinks the current situation is so bleak. "Everyone likes to talk about the 'electronic Pearl Harbor' or the 'electronic Waterloo' scenarios,"
      says Wallace Theiss, a specialist in conflict and security issues. "For the time being I would be much more worried about governments and terrorists with bombs than
      with computers." 
      
      Meanwhile, the US government is taking information warfare seriously. President Clinton recently announced a $1.46 billion program to improve US government
      computer security, including the creation of special "Cyber Cop" units to work with both government and industry. 
      
      Senate Republicans want to give Dartmouth College enough money to create two laboratories to research ways to counter terrorists armed for biological or
      cyber-warfare. The FBI has created a special unit to deal with acts of computer sabotage and crime committed within the US. And the US has been actively using
      information-warfare weapons since the early 1990s, primarily as backup for battlefield operations but also to prepare for future wars that may be fought online. (See
      story on page 16 for more on military's plans for future.) 
      
      "It is a very serious problem," says Adams. "And it's getting more serious day by day. The structures that we have held constant for many years are disappearing and
      we need to look at things with new eyes. After all, your defenses are only as good as the single event that takes you down."

      IDEAS, SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
      
      When terrorists turn to the Internet
      
      Seemingly unconnected events may have a more sinister source: coordinated cyber-hacker attacks.
      
      Tom Regan 
      Special to The Christian Science Monitor
      
                  It's 8 a.m., morning rush hour in New York. People and cars move slowly and somewhat irritably toward the city. Suddenly, the power goes down
                  and traffic lights cease working. Everything comes to a complete stop. Meanwhile, half a country away, the water system malfunctions in Detroit.
                  Then, in Dallas, air traffic becomes dangerously chaotic as guidance systems go offline.
      
                  On the surface, it seems like a series of unconnected events. But information security experts say it could also be the sign of a terrorist cyber-attack -
                  well-coordinated, extremely effective, and so anonymous it leaves its targets not quite sure what happened.
      
                  While the above situation has never taken place, many industry experts say it could. In fact, they're somewhat surprised it hasn't already.
      
      The United States government and US businesses know that developing an effective response to cyber-terrorism is essential. This, at least, is the first step, even
      though they have a long way to go in addressing the problem.
      
      This is the new world of cyber-terrorism.
      
      No other country or group can approach the US conventional-weapon superiority. This is why many terrorists find information terrorism an attractive alternative to
      traditional forms of terrorism. Cyber-terrorism allows terrorists - both foreign and domestic - to inflict damage with no harm to themselves and little chance of being
      caught. It is a way for the "weak" to attack the "strong," particularly to disrupt a stronger force at a key time during an operation.
      
      If you want to understand terrorism in the Information Age, you need to understand how it has changed since the 1970s, says Harvey Kushner, chairman of the
      criminal-justice department at Long Island University and an expert on terrorism.
      
      "We have moved away from state-sponsored terrorism," Dr. Kushner says. "The old model of the hierarchical or 'organized crime' group, no
      longer exists. These days, terrorists move in loose groups, constellations with free-flowing structures. So these days terrorism - both the
      traditional kind and cyber-terrorism - is more the act of the freelancer or the individual. This is true both internationally and nationally."
      
      This doesn't mean states don't play a role in cyber-terrorism, Kushner says. It's just different from the one they played in the past.
      
      "States find ways to encourage this behavior. They will use incendiary rhetoric to inflame passions. This will enrage some freelancer, who will
      then commit an act of cyber-terrorism. The Chinese hacker attacks on US targets after the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade are a
      perfect example. And it comes at no cost to the state, which can say it had nothing to do with the attack," he says.
      
      So who is the modern cyber-terrorist?
      
      "The popular image is very out of kilter with reality," says James Adams, head of Infrastructure Defense, an organization founded to help
      governments and businesses deal with cyber-warfare and terrorism. "You know, the image of the 18-year-old with a ponytail who spends 20
      out of 24 hours over a computer, hacking into a site because it gives him a rush."
      
      In fact, says Mr. Adams, cyber-terrorism is likely to be committed by Russian organized crime, or white supremist groups, or religious cults
      and extremists, to name a few examples.
      
      These groups tend to work in the loose manner Kushner describes, and detailed in a 1999 report on cyber-terrorism, "Countering the New
      Terrorism," by the Rand Corp. It describes the structure of these new networked organizations as "SPIN": segmented, polycentric,
      ideologically integrated networks.
      
      These SPIN groups are not just using the computers to launch attacks, but also to coordinate their activities.
      
      For instance, the Rand report notes that Saudi religious extremist Osama bin Laden's organization "appears to have widely adapted information technology."
      Egyptian members of Mr. bin Laden's network are said to have helped devise a communications network that relies on the Web, e-mail, and electronic bulletin
      boards so that members can exchange information without running a major risk of being caught by US counterterrorism organizations.
      
      A third way that terrorists use the Internet is to tell their "story" directly to the public. Several terrorists groups have used the Web not only to bypass traditional news
      media, but also to influence how the media report on a terrorist act.
      
      But it may not be long before groups like bin Laden's use their technological expertise to launch a cyber-attack.
      
      "With respect to the availability of desirable targets via cyberspace, terrorists are likely to choose to employ electronic attacks only if the reachable assets are
      attractive targets, and as infrastructure industries continue to modernize their information systems to take advantage of the benefits of [information technology], this
      situation will become more likely," notes a report in the fall 1997 issue of Survival, "Information Technology and the Terrorist Threat."
      
      "Cyber-terrorism really is a result of the Internet," says Ed Roche of The Concours Group, an international firm that studies Internet security issues. "Terrorism
      certainly existed before the Internet, but in order to do it, you had to be there. With the Internet, a group in, say, Madras, India, can bring down Con-Ed."
      
      Dr. Roche, who believes there will be a major cyber-terrorist attack on the US in the next two years, says it is corporate, rather than government, information
      structures that are most at risk.
      
      "There is a very poor sense of security in many of these enterprises. Intranets are also a real security problem. And I don't see these factors changing anytime soon."
      
      Also, one of the great difficulties in deterring and defending against terrorist attacks is determining the actual source of the attack, says Prof. Richard Harknett of the
      University of Cincinnati. The potential for anonymity in cyberspace will only make this problem more vexing.
      
      "Two things tend to constrain traditional terrorism: to achieve political ends through terrorism one has to be attributed with the attack, which opens the door to
      retaliation; second, most terrorist attacks involve destruction," he says. "If the line is crossed, retaliation can be invited.
      
      "In cyber-terrorism the main goal will be disruption, rather than destruction," Prof. Harknett says. "In societies highly reliant on information systems, disruption to
      those systems can cause short-term inconvenience, but more importantly, long-term loss of confidence in the viability of those systems. Will the US retaliate with
      military means if ATM banking in New York City is disrupted monthly through repeated attacks? At what point will people begin to question the reliability of
      digitized banking? How many disruptions will it take?"
      
      Back to the hackers.
      
      But what about the simple hacker? One problem with cyber-terrorism, note computer security experts, is that it's hard to tell if a cyber-attack has been launched by
      a rogue state, a terrorist, or a couple of kids in their garage. For instance, one of the most damaging cyber-attacks on the US military infrastructure was launched by
      an Israeli youth with help from some teenagers in California.
      
      As a result, computer-security experts and justice organizations like the FBI now treat all cyber-attacks the same, regardless of the source - a situation that has
      enraged many hackers. Yet part of the reason security experts may be responding this way could be the fear that these "innocent" hackers could turn their talents to
      more ominous purposes.
      
      While the article in Survival notes that terrorism is more extreme and "far more aberrant than prankish hacking," there is no doubt that acts of hacking can have the
      same consequences as acts of terrorism.
      
      "Regarding the question of whether hackers today will be terrorists of tomorrow, one can only point to the fact that some hackers have been willing to act in concert
      to attack the telecommunications infrastructure, and insofar as an infrastructure attack constitutes terrorism, hacker terrorism has already occurred." A recent
      example of hacker terrorism (or is it?) is the Internet worm - Worm.ExploreZip - that created havoc in computer e-mail systems around the world, but particularly at
      corporations such as Microsoft, Intel, and NBC (see worm article page 14).
      
      Protecting against hackers also raises other issues, says Ron Moritz, director of the technology office for Finjan Software Inc., which specializes in mobile code
      security. For instance, how far can the government go to protect itself before it infringes on personal liberties?
      
      "It is possible to send a large current down a phone line and wipe out an individual's computer. But can we do that? Is it right to do that? For instance, where is the
      line 'online' between civil disobedience and terrorism?" Mr. Moritz points to an attempt by the New York-based Electronic Disturbance Theater to "block the
      entrance" of a number of sites in an effort to support the Zapatista movement in Mexico. When the EDT invited people to "sign" a petition that would attempt to
      overload the Pentagon's Web site and computers, the Pentagon fired back a Java software program that crashed the machine of the person who had signed the
      petition on the EDT site.
      
      Another problem may be that while news media coverage is needed to raise awareness of cyber-terrorism, it could lead to bad decisionmaking, according to Glenn
      Buchan in his 1996 report for the Rand Corp., "Information War and the Air Force: Wave of the Future? Current Fad?"
      
      Meanwhile, others are attempting to find solutions to cyberterrorism. Sy Goodman, director of the Stanford University Consortium for Research on Information
      Security and Policy and one of the authors of the Survival article on cyber-terrorism, will host a conference in Palo Alto in early December to try to find international
      answers to cyber-terrorism and cyber-crime. Goodman hopes the conference will lead to agreements that will fight cyber-attacks in the same way nations now agree
      on how to fight air hijacking.
      
      "There needs to be constant discussion of what the situation is," Kushner says. "In the past, we knew who our enemies were. For instance, on the battlefield, they
      wore different uniforms than us. But if no one wore uniforms, we wouldn't know who was on our side or who to fight. What our technology has done is make us
      naked."

         * Dictionary attacks against NDS objects that detect if Intruder
           Detection was triggered.
         * Browse for target servers and gather connection info for spoofing
           attacks.

         * Improved Level3-1 attack which no longer requires using a sniffer to
           find elusive data for Admin session hijacking, just add in the Admin's
           MAC address and we do the rest.
         * Several nasty Denial of Service attacks.

 29.0 Cypherpunks will hold meeting at DefCon 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN
      
      contributed by deepquest 
      SF Bay Area Cypherpunks July 1999 In Two Places At
      One Time! 

      This July, the Bay Area Cypherpunks begin to challenge
      the laws of physics by meeting in two places at one
      time. Our first experiment will be on the campus of
      Stanford University, extracting quantum slack from the
      Stanford Linear Accelerator (er, actually Tresidder Union
      coffee shop) and rematerializing in Las Vegas at Defcon
      at the Alexis Park hotel. Both events will be open public
      meetings on US soil. 

      Events:
      Sat 10 July 1:00 - 5:00 PM
      Stanford University Campus - Tresidder Union courtyard

      Spot the Cypherpunk Contest:
      This will be somewhat easier at Stanford than at Defcon
      :-)

    + HNN: contributed by Space Rogue, HNN hopes everyone has a fun filled Fourth of July weekend. 
      Note, that there will be no news update on Monday. Be sure to check in next week as we 
      attempt to update the site remotely from Defcon7 in LasVegas. 
      
      We should be ready to announce the HNN T-shirts that everyone has been asking for on Tuesday. 

      Oh, and SETI@Home released version 1.5 of the SETI software last Wednesday which fixes quite a
      few bugs. (with all the news lately we forgot to mention it). Be sure to join up with the HNN
