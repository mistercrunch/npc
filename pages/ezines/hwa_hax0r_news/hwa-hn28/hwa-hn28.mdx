  Like all religions, the Holy Religion of the Invisible Pink Unicorn is based
  upon both Logic and Faith. We have Faith that She is Pink; and we Logically 
  know that She is Invisible, because we can't see Her.

   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

 00.1 CONTACT INFORMATION AND MAIL DROP
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Wahoo, we now have a mail-drop, if you are outside of the U.S.A or
    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.

    Send all goodies to:

	    HWA NEWS
	    P.O BOX 44118
	    370 MAIN ST. NORTH
	    BRAMPTON, ONTARIO
	    CANADA
	    L6V 4H5

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

    BUGTRAQ - Subscription info
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    What is Bugtraq?

    Bugtraq is a full-disclosure UNIX security mailing list, (see the info
    file) started by Scott Chasin &lt;chasin@crimelab.com>. To subscribe to
    bugtraq, send mail to listserv@netspace.org containing the message body
    subscribe bugtraq. I've been archiving this list on the web since late
    1993. It is searchable with glimpse and archived on-the-fly with hypermail.

    Searchable Hypermail Index;

          &lt;a href="http://www.eecs.nwu.edu/~jmyers/bugtraq/index.html">Link&lt;/a>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour &lt;sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

    EoC    - End of Commentary

    EoA    - End of Article or more commonly @HWA

    EoF    - End of file

    EoD    - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN &lt;g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper
             noun means the hackernews site proper. k? k. ;&

            Phreaking, Hacking, Anarchy, Cracking, Carding (CC) Groups Virus, Warfare

          Alternates: H - hacking, hacktivist

   *RTFM  - Read the fucking manual - not always applicable since some manuals are
            pure shit but if the answer you seek is indeed in the manual then you
            should have RTFM you dumb ass.

    TBC   - To Be Continued also 2bc (usually followed by ellipses...) :^0

    TBA   - To Be Arranged/To Be Announced also 2ba

    TFS   - Tough fucking shit.

      Debunking The Debunked 
      Wednesday, July 28, 1999 at 23:57:30
      by Mike D. Schiffman - Reprinted With Permission 
 
      In a 16-foot wide 9-year old trailer park home in New Mexico, a
      52-year old delusional woman sits in front of a computer toiling away
      on a non-technical "hacking" document fraught with errors.
 
      You might remember Carolyn P Meinel as 'The Happy Hacker' from
      such E-Files as "A Weekend Without My Zoloft" and the underground
      classic "Has Anyone Seen My Dignity?"
 
      Although some people would like to classify Carolyn as 'merely'
      delusional or talent-less, our research has added 'washed-up crackpot'
      and 'media charlatan.' Often we wonder how Carolyn has achieved so
      little over so much time, and with this brief interlude, we peel back the
      layers of the onion with an exclusive report from DefCon7.
 
      As it happened during the weekend of July 9th in Las Vegas, NV at
      the seventh installment of the DefCon Security Convention, it appears
      that Carolyn forgot her medicine. And these aren't simple antibiotics or
      histamine blockers (although she could probably use those too). No
      dear friends, these are powerful psycho-reactive mind-altering
      chemicals such as sertaline hydrochloride and diazepam. This woman
      has serious mental problems that require medication and treatment. 
 
      We caught up with Carolyn in the hotel bar at the Alexis Park, this
      interviewer was participating in some lighthearted revelry with friends
      and cohorts, enjoying the ebb and flow of the convention we've come
      to know and love... Late into the night we had a great time recounting
      times past.
 
      As the night progressed, we moved the group out of the bar into the
      hotel foyer where our merriment was abruptly halted. The foul stench
      of insanity lingered in that part of the hotel, and it was instantly known
      to all that Carolyn was upon us.
 
      Initially, I found myself finding a good deal of humor with her attire, I
      pondered the drifter's corpse that she absconded her dress from, and
      focused on my mission at hand. The question on everyone's lips:
 
      "Is Virginia here this year?"
 
      However, before I could gather my senses, a whirlwind of stupidity
      was unleashed as Carolyn's disease attempted to spread to another
      mind. With her gaping maw open, she turned the boring-machine up to
      11 and hosed down an unsuspecting convention-goer.
 
      With all that had happened, I was stunned. This was the heaviest blow
      of all. I could find no other recourse but to confront her on one of the
      numerous topics that burn in the scene. It was, at that time still unclear
      to me why she had misinformed the FBI that I was involved in HFG,
      and I decided to question her on that, in the hopes of two results.
      Intended result #1 was to shut her the fuck up for a minute. Intended
      result #2 was to get an explanation, apology, or at best a
      rationalization. However, as she turned to me with the vapid stare of
      ignorance, I knew no one could win this battle. No good would come
      from this conversation, and Carolyn made sure of that.
 
      Initially, Carolyn feigned stupidity (which was eerily convincing, but
      even the best lies are peppered with truth) and claimed she didn't
      know me. Having dealt with this woman numerous times (including a
      few *shudder* face-to-face meetings) and given she tried to implicate
      me within the ranks of HFG, the ruse lacked even humor, as the
      attempt was so weak.
 
      After a few hot comments were traded, Carolyn's attempt at throwing
      down the gauntlet was to challenge myself and my cohorts to 'hack'
      into her modified Linux box. Now, perhaps Carolyn misunderstands
      the way the new generation of hacker-types operate. First of all, we
      don't get out of bed for less than a hundred dollars. And we certainly
      don't waste our time breaking into a machine that serves no real
      purpose. Why Carolyn used her box in the capture the flag
      competition as a challenge is beyond us, as her personal website has
      been hacked more times than are worth counting. And honestly, at this
      point, who hasn't received a DCC offer of her mailbox or home
      directory tarred up? If that is not evidence of her inability to truly
      secure a box, then I don't know what is. Granted, she wished to rest
      on her insignificant laurels, and a subtle crack about using finger to
      break into her box was sufficient to diffuse that portion of the
      conversation.
 
      With her last karate-inept leg kicked out from underneath her, Carolyn
      attempted to leave with a modicum of respectability, which sadly
      slipped from her grasp due to her own failings and incompetence...
 
      The Granny Hacker from Heck? Hardly (except the older-than-dirt
      part). The Clown Princess? I suppose this is half true. Clowns are an
      amusing sort, accustomed to being ridiculed. But I think she missed the
      princess bit by about 30 years. The Happy Hacker? She didn't seem
      very happy to us. Especially with the 3 part Antionline article, that
      starts off attempting to be slightly informational, but ends up being a
      diatribe of self-promotion and bitter remarks about convention goers.
 
      No Carolyn, you're not part of "the club". We're sorry, but you're too
      crazy, too medicated, too old, and too stupid.
 
      Also, Carolyn, you had more than a week between the end of DefCon
      and the posting of the Antionline article. The best insult you could
      come up with was to say I `pumped my muscles up with a bike
      pump`? I mean, what sort of 1940's street-tough book of insults are
      you consulting? Double dumbass on you Carolyn.
 
      Contrary to what she swears up and down, Carolyn Meinel is indeed a
      confidential informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and her
      status is listed as "MI" and "PS". MI indicates that the informant suffers
      from a mental or emotional dysfunction, and all information must be
      scrutinized as such. PS means that she is a probable suspect. This is
      why the FBI polygraphed her. Do you trust her?
 
      Now, don't get us wrong. We actually like Carolyn Meinel. As Virii
      makers have a symbiotic relationship with companies that make
      Anti-Virii software, true hackers and their ilk have a symbiotic
      relationship with the uninformed vocal nay-sayers that try to misinform
      the public as to our actions. Without Carolyn, no one would know
      how great we really are. It is impossible to fully appreciate what
      `good` is when you have no frame of reference in understanding what
      `bad` is. For this, we can only thank you Carolyn. Your efforts and
      misinformation only further our roles as highly paid debunkers of your
      insanity. When you're 65 and retired, or possibly deceased -- we'll just
      be entering the prime of our lives and professional careers. If you're
      still around then and your descent into lunacy hasn't pushed you over
      the brink, look us up. We love clowns.
 
      And, by the way Carolyn, do send Virginia my love.

     Prelude
     
     Defcon baby, yeah that's the ticket, hackers, computer security consultants, feds, kooks, surveillance geeks, and a whole slew of other weird ass spooky mother
     fuckers, get drunk, go to titty bars, talk about crypto and network security, fucking with the media, blowing shit up in the desert and generally have a great fucking
     time in the city of sin all under the guise of a computer security convention. And if they are lucky or sneaky paid for by their respective bosses. I am neither lucky or
     sneaky so I'm paying for this out of my own pocket, which by the way sucks. But I'm ready the tickets are bought the gear is packed. I have fortified myself for this
     trip, with a bowl of corn flakes, a cache of CDs, and a hangover. I dry swallow two Alleve as I step out the door. 
     
     The 3 hour bus ride to the airport was about as exciting as a 3 hour a bus ride can be. In other words deathly boring. But the headache is gone. I'm at the airport
     lounge, drinking a L.I.T and trying to figure out if 7 buck is to much to pay for a burger. Airports are about the most boring places to be stranded for any length of
     time as well. The televisions only show 2 things, golf or 5 minute news reels. The food is generic and expensive. And there is no fucking place to check my e-mail.
     Only another 4 hours till my plane leaves. The Plane: It's a sign when 12 mothers carrying screaming babies get on the flight. We hit the worst turbulence I have ever
     seen or felt. [the guy beside just used his barf bag for it's intend purpose]. I can see it now the wings snap off and barrrroooooooom! I'm just another flight statistic.
     Wouldn't that just be the rats asshole to die on the way to Detroit.
     
     [Note at this point this article goes into short hand mode, there was just to much happening to quickly for me to mention, remember or talk about] 
     
     Friday
     
     From this point on things be come an insane blur of meeting new people and getting things done. I arrive 3 hours late to the hotel, the people I'm staying with had a
     hell of a time checking in and I'm exhausted , I have a glass of water and go to bed. Friday First day of con I get up, get dressed and eat some breakfast all by 7:00.
     To do my part by gooning at the con. Big mistake It's a mad rush after that, from getting a goon badge to working on pre-registration. The List for registration is
     great except that it's not in any order. So I GREP the whole list a couple of hundred times during the con. I check people in all day long. By the end of the day I
     know almost everyone at con who is on the list. Naked people count for Friday: 1 guy gets up on a table and strips down to his G-string, 2 naked fat guys jog
     around the vendor area for free t-shirts 1 babe hops up and a table and gives everybody a show of her tits. I love Vegas. The day is hectic and long. I'm exhaust by
     the time I sit down at 7:17 to write this before heading out to the MGM grand for some dinner. Vegas is a weird as ass place. New York New York the most
     disturbing of all. The fake graffiti, the fake manhole cover with fake steam, all in fake NYC it is not right I was just waiting for a fake mugging in a fake dark and dirty
     alley. After getting back to the hotel I collapsed on the bed.
     
     Saturday
     
     Slept a hard 8 hours last night, got up and help register people, mad craziness more people then you could possibly images. All of them young white males. Checked
     out the DJ action, saw my ghetto hacker buddies TDA and Jester 47 spin some mad tunes to Ninja Scroll video. The CDC show rocked ass. Total mayhem, with a
     revival theme, it doesn't get much better then this. Things slowed down a bit. Checked press badge for the After CDC presentation in the media suite. Went up and
     talked with some media types. Got to see what the media is like in action. I expected to hear some really probing question that were well researched and insightful.
     They weren't, nuff said. Finally got to chill about 7 or 8 helped set up for the root suite party. Went back to my room changed and got booze, went back to the root
     suite and proceed to drop a complete bottle of tequila on the floor. Saturday night Mad partying in the root suite Saturday night. I played bartender for most of the
     night, pouring DoC beers, serving punch and mixing drinks. Dis Org Crew beer was great. The Strawberry SYN Flood was smooth and sweet, the Brown Box
     Barley Wine was strong as hell, and the FireWire Stout which is fortified with caffeine is the perfect hacker beer. Congrats to HCF, Wyatt Earp, Pete Shipley and
     the rest of the DoC who helped for a great beer. Caezar defiantly knows how to throw a party. Towards the end of the night I was getting help from Jennifer
     Grannick. Left about 4 or 5 went back to the room and slept like the dead. Slept for 2 hours and got back up. I had a English muffin for breakfast it was good. 
     
     Sunday
     
     By Sunday the kinks had been somewhat worked out and things were finally running reasonable smoothly, I helped with this and that. Sold shirt and mugs for the
     better part of the morning, some guy wanted to trade a rental car for a t-shirt, I told him to get permission from Priest. He ended up trading us some porno passes
     for a shirt instead. Finally had lunch with some cool people's one of which was with the NSA. After lunch I'm up in the media/goon lounge resting and eating some
     fruit with Major Malfunction when his radio goes off, "all goons to the NOC" and then "Carolyn is being kicked out" Needless to say Carolyn got kicked out of con..
     I'm sure that she will write all about it on her web site. I'm sure she will paint herself as the victim, either way I don't care, she is an adult and she should have known
     better. After word I wandered around some more. Said good-bye to all the people I could find. Went back to the hotel grabbed my bag want got on a plane fell
     asleep. Switch planes fell asleep. got off plane got on bus fell asleep, switch busses fell asleep. Got off bus got home fell asleep. ....till next year. 
     
       
          Quotes from the weekend: 
     
     A short conversation I had with some newbie kid who wandered into the root party.
     " So your in l0pht"
     " oh yeah me and the rest of the east coast people"
     "really"
     
     "My son did his first hack at age 7, I was so proud." Major Malfunction.

      (Q/A)
     
      01. How do i tell if a system is running UNIX? 
        A:  There are several ways to determine the operating system of a remote 
         system. The first and foremost way to determine if a system is running 
         UNIX is to both telnet and ftp to it, then check the login message. For 
         telnet, if you get anything like BSD, UNIX, Linux, AIX, IRIX, or HPUX 
         then it is most likely a unix system. However, it is possible to change 
         the message displayed (/etc/issue.net) when a telnetd connection is
         established, so telnet banner grabbing is not always the most reliable. 
         Via ftp, you can usually make a fairly accurate guess at the OS by looking 
         at the ftpd version. If you see something like wu, ncfptd, or proftpd, then
         it is a UNIX system. Most large ftp archives run UNIX, but just in case, 
         look for a message containing "Microsoft" or "Serv-U", which do not run on
         anything but ms windows (bad!).
         Another more accurate way of determining the OS is to examine the packets 
         via predetermined OS fingerprints. There are several packages out now
         which do this, the best of them being nmap by fyodor
         (http://www.insecure.org/nmap), and queso by els apostols. These simply
         scan the open ports on a system and attempt to find a match for the packet 
         types. Nmap currently includes hundreds of OS fingerprints, and is known 
         for its accuracy and speed. OS fingerprinting is not one-hundred percent 
         accurate either; the details of this are too complex for this paper.
         Basically, some system administrators change the look of the outgoing 
         packets to fool your scanner into thinking it is something else, or give it
         no reading whatsoever. the details are available at 
         http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq.
     
     
      02. How do i determine which flavor of UNIX a system runs?
        A:  (see telnet banner grabbing description above) -- telnet banners
         often reveal which OS and version the system is running. If you have
         local access to the machine (an account), then you can type uname -a to 
         see some system information. On Linux, you can cd to /proc and cat cpuinfo 
         for other interesting stats. If the system is running RedHat Linux, then
         a file exists in /etc called redhat-release which contains the release and 
         version of the system.
         I am also working on a package to determine the distrobution of a system 
         via comparing rpm's to known fingerprints (similar to nmap), thus making 
         it easier to find an exploit which will work on the system.
     
     
      03. What exactly happens when i "hack" UNIX?
        A:  To know whether or not you have successfully "hacked" a UNIX system, 
         there are a few commands you need to be familiar with:
      _______________________________________________________________________________
      | command  | description                                                      |
      |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | id       | prints your current UID/GID. 0 = root = success!                 |
      | whoami   | determines which user you are logged in as.                      |
      | set      | shows a list of some system variables including $USER and $EUID. |
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         If you don't know what root is, then you need to do some background UNIX 
         research before reading this again. Otherwise, here are a few other tricks 
         to see if you are really root.
          a. bash prompt: When logged in as a normal user, you usually have a prompt
                          similar to bash$. As root, your prompt defaults to bash#.
          b. system variables: typing echo "$USER / $EUID" *should* effectively tell
                               you which user the system thinks you are.
          c. file access: As root, you should have access to read/write most files. 
                          Try logging in as a normal user and reading /etc/shadow 
                          or /etc/passwd. Most systems do not allow normal users to 
                          read these files for security reasons however, if you are 
                          root, you may read/write them as you wish.
     
     
      04. Do I need an account on a system to hack it?
        A:  No. Many systems can be compromised remotely via overflows in vulnerable
         services running. This is the main difference between hacking UNIX and NT: 
         UNIX was designed with remote administration in mind, thus making it easier
         to manipulate once access is obtained. With NT, no telnet daemon is 
         present, and playing around usually requires your presence at the actual 
         system itself. Of course anyone with 1/2 of a brain can secure their system
         from remote attacks, so a local account is a definate bonus.
     
     
      05. What is DoS?
        A:  No kiddies, this isnt C:\DOS. This is Denial of Service, a very deadly 
         (and lame) concept. As there are very few useful purposes for DoS, it is 
         mostly used to show power and skill, even though it requires almost no
         skill whatsoever. The only useful reason i can think of to DoS a system is 
         for spoofing purposes: when a system is taken off of a LAN, you can change 
         your address to the one you knocked off, and intercept vital information 
         and user passwords. This is explained in detail at http://www.rootshell.com
         (under documentation) look for whitepapers on tcp hijacking. Ok, back to 
         my explanation of DoS. Denial of Service by definition is simply denying 
         service to any machine on a network, thus causing problems and/or crashing 
         the system. The most popular DoS attacks out right now (to my limited 
         knowledge) are papasmurf, boink/poink, feh, smack, bmb, and synk5. These 
         are commonly used toys on irc, so watch your back.
     
      
      06. How do I protect myself from DoS attacks?
        A:  There is no one-hundred percent reliable method for stopping DoS 
         attacks. If the attackers bandwidth is much greater than yours, then you 
         lose: end of story. However, if the attacker has equal or lesser resources 
         than you, they are easily filtered out by software such as ipfwadm for 
         linux 2.0.x, ipchains for linux 2.2.x, and conseal pc firewall for windows. 
         Some interesting firewall/filtering scripts can be found at 
         http://www.freshmeat.net and http://www.linuxberg.com. If you like to
         chat on irc (yay!), then it is wise to use a bnc (bounce) to hide your real
         address and virtually irc off of a faster connection. bnc source is
         available for download at ftp.bitchx.org/pub/misc.
     
      
      07. What is a buffer overflow?
        A:  In short, a buffer overflow is the pushing of data onto a stack, thus 
         executing carefully constructed code as the user the program is running as. 
          Example:
           [benz@oldbox]$ whoami
           benz
           [benz@oldbox]$ /usr/bin/sperl4.036 AAAAAA(etc..) [garbage]/bin/sh
           Segmentation Fault
           [root@oldbox]# whoami
           root
         The above log is an example of the classic sperl overflow which drops root 
         access. To make sure the program you are trying to overflow will give you 
         root, you need to type ls -al file and look for "s" in the permissions
         somewhere, and that it is owned by root. This indicates that the program 
         is suid/root and when run will actually switch to user root and execute.
         This explanation is a very short and simple version of a complex topic, 
         which can be studied in more detail at http://www.phrack.com - issue 49-14:
         "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit" by Aleph One.
     
     
      08. What are some good web/ftp sites for UNIX?
        A:
         Bugtraq security mailing list: http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq
         rootshell archives (out of date): http://www.rootshell.com

         2600 magazine: http://www.2600.com
         Phrack magazine: http://www.phrack.com
     
     
      09. What is BSD?
        A:  BSD, short for Berkeley Systems Distrobution, is a UNIX flavor known for 
         its stability and ease of use. More information can be found at
         http://www.freebsd.org, http://www.openbsd.org, www.bsdi.org, etc.
     
     
      10. What is Linux?
        A:  Linux, originally developed my Linus Torvalds, is a POSIX based OS
         commonly used by everyone from hackers to goat feeders. more information
         can be found at http://www.linux.org.
     
     
      11. What does x86 have to do with anything?
        A:  x86 is the standard abbreviation for an intel processor based
         system. the x has nothing to do with the processor, it is simply a 
         wildcard definition for all *86 systems. Example: i386, 586 (pentium).
     
     
      12. What else is there besides x86 systems?
        A:  Besides Intel based systems, their are many other architectures
         used with UNIX. Probably the most common non-x86 architecture is a
         sparc. Although capable of handling almost anything, these typically
         run either SunOS or Solaris.
     
     
      13. What are some commonly open services to look for?
        A:  The services i generally look for the most are very dependant on
         what OS the target is running. For example, if the target system is
         Linux 2.0.3x, I typically scan for rpcbind/portmap on tcp/111 because of
         the well known mountd overflow. Below is a brief list of what I check for
         specifically on several operating systems.
          Redhat 4.2: tcp/143 (imap), etc..
          RedHat 5.0: tcp/25 (sendmail), tcp/143 (imap), tcp/25 (qpop), tcp/53 (bind)
          RedHat 5.1: tcp/111 (rpcinfo -p &lt;target>), tcp/110 (qpop), tcp/53 (bind)
          RedHat 5.2: tcp/21 (wu-2.4.2-academ[BETA-18](1))
          Slackware: tcp/111 (rpc), tcp/110 (qpop), tcp/21 (wu-ftpd), tcp/53 (bind)
          FreeBSD: tcp/110 (qpop), tcp/143 (imap), tcp/53 (bind)
          Solaris: tcp/110 (rpc), tcp/53 (bind)
          
          
      14. What is the easiest way to hack a system right now?
        A: &lt;see #13 for service list>
     
     
      15. Can i hack anything from windows?
        A:  Suprisingly, yes. There are about 50 different ways you can hack
         with just a web browser. These are known as cgi exploits; below is a list
         of several which i typically check for:
            /cgi-bin/phf
            /cgi-bin/php.cgi
            /cgi-bin/Count.cgi
            /cgi-bin/info2www
            /_vti_pvt/service.pwd
            /cgi-bin/test-cgi
            /cfdocs/expeval/openfile.cfm
            /cgi-dos/args.bat
            /cgi-win/uploader.exe
            
     
      16. Why is Linux a better OS than windows?
        A:  There are hundreds of reasons why Linux owns windows, but instead
         of explaining all of them, I'll just give you some advice: take my
         word for it. If you happen to be one of those people that needs facts
         to survive, check out http://www.darkelf.net/metachart.
     
     
      17. What is suid/sgid?
        A: &lt;see #07>
     
     
      18. Where is the best source of info for newbies?
        A:  My best reccomendation would definatly have to be irc. Since most
         hackers tend to learn things on their own, hacking resources are not as
         plentiful as they probably should be, but there are still excellent sources
         available. See the URL section above for more information.
     
     
      19. How much trouble can I get in for hacking?
        A:  The typical student hacker (such as me) is still under the age of
         18, rendering him a minor. If adult charges cannot be filed, then don't
         worry about much other than a harsh bitching and possibly a small fine.
         For those of you that no longer have the age advantage, I reccomend
         consulting a lawyer before getting seriously into hacking. This may sound
         a bit extreme, but anyone who gets good enough to be noticed needs a
         lawyer eventually anyway. For some information on what can happen as
         an adult, just take a look at http://www.kevinmitnick.com.
     
     
      20. What kind of system should I try hacking first?
        A:  For beginners, the first computer I reccomend trying to root is
         your own. Their is no better way of security and learning than a local 
         machine that you actually own and operate. Try experimenting with
         several UNIX flavors such as Linux and BSD, then it's up to you from there.

06.0 Group approves controversial software law

     Group approves controversial software law 
   
     By Jack McCarthy, Nancy Weil, and Jessica Davis 
     InfoWorld Electric 
   
     Posted at 5:00 PM PT, Jul 30, 1999 
               In a blow to both big corporate software consumers and those who buy their software in retail stores, a group that works to unify state laws this
     week passed the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) legislation, which is widely opposed by software consumer advocates, software
     developers, and IT organizations. 
   
     The legislation will theoretically allow software vendors to repossess software by disabling it remotely, and to disclaim warranties. It will also prevent the
     transfer of software licenses from one party to another without vendor permission, and will outlaw reverse engineering. 
   
     UCITA's opponents said that its development was heavily influenced by software manufacturers, and that it favors them in software contracts and disputes
     concerning software licensing. 
   
     "What purpose is it going to serve other than litigation and additional cost to users?" said Michael Scott, a senior engineer at the California Department of
     Transportation, in Sacramento, Calif. "It sounds like a great coup for the software industry, but doesn't sound very advantageous for users." 
   
     Members of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) voted on UCITA and several other revisions to the commercial
     code at their annual meeting in Denver. 
   
     In a state-by-state vote, 43 states approved UCITA, six opposed it, two abstained, and two were not present at the voting. The proposal now goes to various
     state legislatures for approval. Most or all states typically approve the laws recommended by the NCCUSL. IT opposition to the legislation, including a
     letter-writing campaign to members of the NCCUSL, failed to sway the commissioners. 
   
     The dry, complex language of the 123-page legislation may also have contributed to a lack of understanding on the part of many software users. 
   
     Proponents of the legislation have said that UCITA is a necessary step in defining the law regarding software and computer information sales, which were not
     contemplated when the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for the sale of goods was written. 
   
     The act means both vendors and users will be able to count on a uniform law, instead of relying on differing laws on a state-by-state basis, according to Ray
     Nimmer, a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center and the law's primary author. 
   
     "We think that this will extend the rights of end-users," Nimmer said. 
   
     Nimmer said that the opposition to the law during the last year and a half has been punctuated by hyperbole, and now it is critical that the debate shift over to
     reality. 
   
     Opponents to the legislation include technology consumer groups, various trade associations, and some law professors, who contend that UCITA will result in
     increased costs for companies, while giving software vendors undue power. 
   
     "This law is going to be bad for the industry and for the country," said Cem Kaner, a software developer, attorney, and author who has taken a lead in fighting
     the proposal. "It redefines intellectual property law in a way that transfers huge amounts of power from the public, including universities, libraries, and [software]
     customers, to software publishers." In the days before the final UCITA vote, several state attorneys wrote letters to the president of NCCUSL, urging the group
     to reject the law. An estimated 25 to 28 attorney generals have gone on the record in opposition, including those from Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
     Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Washington state.

07.0 Falun Gong Web Sites Attacked by China?

     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by tacscan 
      Web sites of the group Falun Gong a meditation group is
      claiming that the web sites of its supporters are being
      target and attacked by China. Initial evidence seems to
      point to the Public Security Ministry's Internet
      Monitoring Bureau as the agnecy responsible for various
      attacks. Falun Gong, outlawed in China, is a group that
      draws on martial arts, Buddhism and Taoism and is
      devoted to physical and mental fitness, high moral
      standards, and denies that it is either a religion or a
      political movement.

      Chinese officials try to hack U.S. Web sites, meditation
      group members say 
     
      By Peter Svensson, Associated Press, 07/30/99 16:17 
     
      NEW YORK (AP) Web sites in the United States and elsewhere devoted to the Falun Gong
      meditation group are coming under heavy electronic attack, managers of the sites said Friday, and
      at least one ''hacking'' attempt appears to trace back to a Chinese national police bureau in Beijing. 
     
      Falun Gong has been banned in China, where communist authorities are engaged in an escalating
      crackdown, arresting adherents and confiscating publications and videos. 
     
      Bob McWee, of Middletown, Md., a Falun Gong practitioner, said a site he maintains to promote
      the group, www.falunusa.net, has been under persistent electronic assault. 
     
      In a telephone interview, McWee said his Web server was undergoing a continuous
      ''denial-of-service'' attack, a common Internet tactic used to overwhelm a computer with repeated
      electronic requests like a telephone ringing nonstop to block other callers. 
     
      In addition, someone tried to gain access to the server, pretending to be a legitimate webmaster,
      and in the process left an Internet address, he said. 
     
      ''They tried to hack my machine from theirs. And they can't do that without revealing their'' Internet
      address, he said. 
     
      The address McWee said was left behind is registered with the Asia Pacific Network Information
      Centre, a public registry service for Internet addressees. According to the service, there are two
      phone numbers in Beijing listed with that address. 
     
      When The Associated Press called the numbers, a person who answered the phone identified them
      as belonging to the Public Security Ministry. A telephone operator at the ministry said they
      belonged to its Internet Monitoring Bureau. 
     
      Ministry officials and spokesmen refused to comment Friday. 
     
      McWee registered a complaint about the hacking attempt with the Maryland state police's
      computer crimes division. 
     
      Police spokesman Pete Piringer said that because the attack did not succeed in getting access to
      McWee's server, there did not seem to be a crime committed. 
     
      A U.S. government agency saw an indirect sign of the attacks. 
     
      A network engineer at the U.S. Department of Transportation contacted McWee when they
      noticed his server was contacting one of their computers unasked, according to Everett Dowd,
      deputy director of telecommunications of the Information Technology Operation at the department. 
     
      McWee said this was because the denial-of-service attack sent requests to his server with forged
      return addresses, one of which happened to be the department's server. 
     
      Administrators of other Web sites devoted to the movement also said they had been attacked. 
     
      Li Shao, in Nottingham, Britain, said the site he maintains was hacked into Monday. What he called
      Chinese ''government propaganda'' was placed on some pages, while others were deleted. 
     
      Jillian Ye, of Toronto, Canada, who maintains two sites, said that beginning one or two months ago,
      her server began going down almost every day. The problems got progressively worse, until she
      recognized the symptoms of an attack and moved the sites to a more secure server. 
     
      In their barrage of criticism of Falun Gong, Chinese state media have cited the group's Internet
      presence as proof that it was well-organized and not just harmless meditation buffs. 
     
      A government ban on Falun Gong publications passed after the group was outlawed includes
      electronic publications. Nearly all of Falun Gong Web sites in China have been shut down since the
      ban was announced. 
     
      China's communist leaders banned the Falun Gong movement last week, accusing it of trying to
      develop political power. Falun Gong leaders have denied any political ambitions and denied they
      organized protests that erupted two weeks ago after authorities reportedly arrested leading
      members of the group. 
     
      Falun Gong, founded by Li Hongzhi, who now lives in the United States, draws on martial arts,
      Buddhism and Taoism. The group says its goals are physical and mental fitness and high moral
      standards, and denies that it is either a religion or a political movement.

08.0 Super Computer Almost Gets Away 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Mudge 
      Sandia National Laboratories sold a surplus nuclear
      weapons research computer, an old Intel Paragon XPS,
      as "spare parts", without the OS to a Chinese national in
      California for $30,000 last October. Quing-Chang Jiang,
      a citizen of the Peoples Republic of China, then tried to
      buy the parts from Intel needed to make it run again.
      After conferring with the DOE, Sandia then paid $88,000
      two weeks ago to get it back because of security
      worries about the deal. The computer, the fastest in
      the world in 1993, while now obsolete by U.S.
      standards, could have aided a foreign government in
      duplicating the advanced work done by US nuclear
      weapons labs. (Super Computers just aren't that hard
      to get a hold of these days, even fully functional ones.)

      U.S. buys back computer sold
      to Chinese citizen

      Associated Press 

      WASHINGTON -- The Energy Department's Sandia National
      Laboratory last week bought back a supercomputer it had sold as
      surplus to Korber Jiang, a Chinese citizen who is the principle of EHI
      Group USA and exports American goods to his home country.

      Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., called Friday for Energy Secretary Bill
      Richardson's resignation, saying that the computer could have been
      used ``to design nuclear weapons.''

      ``He's going around the country saying there are no problems in the
      Department of Energy, that everything is under control,'' Weldon said
      in a telephone interview. ``If there are no problems, then how can this
      happen?''

      Neal Singer, a spokesman for Sandia National Laboratories, said that
      the New Mexico facility sold the Intel Paragon XPS to Korber's
      one-man company for $30,000 in October. After discovering
      Korber's nationality, Singer said, the department bought back the
      computer for $88,000 last week and stored it under guard at Sandia.
      The spokesman said the difference in cost may have been due to
      shipping costs incurred by Korber.

      ``Secretary Richardson has instituted a moratorium on any sales of
      surplus material that incorporates export control technology until there
      has been a thorough review of what happened,'' said Energy
      Department spokeswoman Brooke Anderson.

      The transaction was first reported by Insight Magazine.

     Symantec: Vandals didn't infect us
     By Robert Lemos, ZDNN
     August 2, 1999 2:02 PM PT
     URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2307804,00.html
     
     Internet vandals broke into the servers of network security and utilities firm Symantec Corp.
     Monday morning, defacing the company's Web site. 
     
     While the vandals claimed to have infected Symantec's network two months ago with a worm,
     quaintly dubbed Bloworm, the company denied Monday that any worm existed on its systems. 
     
     "There is no virus infection, no worm infection, and no danger to customers," said Richard Saunders,
     a spokesman for the Cupertino, Calif., company. 
     
     "They didn't get in beyond posting a mildly offensive, but otherwise impotent, message on our home
     page." 
     
     The five cyber vandals, who identified themselves only by their handles, claimed otherwise. "0ur
     w0rm iz spreading around (Symantec's) netw0rk and infecting (it's) f1lez, since about 2 months ago.
     phear," stated the group in a document of typically spelling-impaired hacker-speak. The document
     was left behind by the group after it broke into the servers of Symantec at about 5 a.m. PT Monday.
     
     Worms are virus-like programs that infect systems through networks automatically and without the
     need for an unknowing user to open a file or run an application. 
     
     Symantec (Nasdaq:SYMC) has always been a popular target for Internet vandals looking for a hard
     nut to crack. The only difference: This time someone actually got in. 
     
     "What this incident does show is that you cannot be complacent towards this kind of threat," said
     Saunders. The Symantec spokesman could not detail how the cyber vandals entered the company's
     network. 
     
     Symantec engineers took down the page within an hour of its posting, but not before the media in
     Europe got wind of the defacement. The BBC posted a story early Monday morning.

     BBC;
     
     Anti-virus company hacked
     A leading provider of net security and anti-virus software, Symantec, 
     has had its website hacked for about 12 hours, ending around 1300 BST. 
     
     The FBI has been informed and is already beginning an investigation.
     
     Visitors to www.symantec.com early on Monday found a page claiming that a
     group of five crackers had infiltrated Symantec's servers with a virus called
     bloworm. 
     
     The crackers said that their virus, a worm, has been spreading around 
     Symantec's network, infecting files for two months. 
     
     However, Aled Miles, Symantec's Regional Director for UK and Ireland, told BBC News
     Online: "I can categorically state that there is no effect on our servers internally
     - that is a hoax which adds to the publicity wagon." 
     
     He added that: "We have established that there was no risk [of infection] to anyone
     visiting our website during that time." 
     
     
     Symantec are the makers of Norton Anti-virus software and their UK website says: 
     "Symantec is a leader in Internet and content security."   
     The hacking of their website will be seen as embarrassing but Mr Miles said that any
     organisation, even the CIA itself, could fall prey to malicious attacks like these. 
     
     He said: "The sad reality is that whilst the Internet is a tremendous new technological
     force, it comes with its down side. What matters is how quickly we as a company react to
     this type of incident. 
     
     "What I am not embarassed about is the speed and agility we have shown in sorting this
     out. I don't think it damages our reputation in the slightest." 
     
     Symantec has become a higher profile target in recent months due to its work in combatting
     viruses such as Melissa, explore.zip and the program Back Orifice.

10.0 New virus due to hit town "New virus spills your beans " - BBC

     New virus spills your beans
     A new strain of computer virus could distribute your highly confidential documents all over the Internet.
         
     Anti-virus developers are warning that they cannot develop an antidote until the virus appears. Far from
     destroying vital files, the virus will make sure everyone can see them. 
     
     The new virus is expected to be a variant of either Melissa or the Explore.Zip worm, both of which have 
     cost businesses millions in recent weeks. 
     
     Both Melissa and the Explore.Zip worm rely on people opening email attachments. Once into the computer 
     the virus sends a message to everyone in the victim's in-box and then destroys every file written in 
     Microsoft Word, Excel or Powerpoint, among others. 
     
     New virus on the block 
     
     One variant has already appeared. PrettyPark replicates itself by sending copies to everyone in the victim's
     address book. 
     
     It waits silently until the victim is on the Internet, then sends lists of the victim's user names, password
     files and address lists to Internet Relay Chat channels. Anti-virus developers are expecting the next step to
     be a virus which roots around in your files and then posts your documents across the Internet. 
     
     "The virus wouldn't be able to tell which of your documents are secret. It might just post your shopping list,
     or it could be a highly sensitive company document. 
     
     "What's more, it would appear as if you sent it," says Graham Cluley of Sophos Anti-Virus. 
     
     Several anti-virus makers already have an answer to PrettyPark. But they cannot build a defence against future
     variants until they encounter them. 
     
     Java and ActiveX - next infection target 
     
     It is predicted that the next generation of viral infections will hit small Webpage programmes called applets,
     written in Java and particularly ActiveX. 
     
     A recent survey revealed that more than half of medium-sized organisations using an intranet had no security 
     policy in place to respond to the threat of attacks on Java applets. 
     
     Recent estimates indicate that Melissa, Explore.Zip and other malicious attacks have cost US business $7.6bn

11.0 New York Times Debunked - FIDNet Moves Ahead as Planned 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Ted 
      The Register has taken the time to actually read the
      draft proposal reported on last week by John Markoff of
      the New York Times. The draft proposal, now seven
      weeks old, calls for the creation of the Federal Intrusion
      Detection Network, or FIDNET. When the NYT reported
      on this story last week privacy advocates cried foul
      claiming that such a network would intrude on personal
      freedoms. Obviously a closer look at the document is
      warranted. 

      The Register 
      http://www.theregister.co.uk/990730-000022.html

      Officials from the CIAO and NIPC and other groups have
      said that the recent media attention and public outcry
      over the proposed FIDNet will not prevent the plan from
      going forward.

      US net snooping plans debunked
    
      Terror spread across the Net on Thursday when New York Times correspondent John
      Markoff broke the Big Story: a National Security Council draft proposal will put the FBI in
      control of "a sophisticated software system to monitor activities on non-military
      Government networks, and a separate system to track networks used in crucial industries."
    
    
      Ghastly. The body to be created will be called the Federal Intrusion Detection Network, or
      FIDNET. Big Brother by another name, no doubt. Libertarian alarmists and conspiracy
      paranoiacs dropped their daily meds and rose angrily, if unsteadily, to arms. 
    
      "The plan... specifies that the data [FIDNET] collects will be gathered at the National
      Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), an interagency task force housed at the Federal
      Bureau of Investigation," the Times went on, adding that "the plan strikes at the heart of a
      growing controversy over how to protect the nation's computer systems while also
      protecting civil liberties -- particularly since it would put a new and powerful tool into the
      hands of the FBI." 
    
      But it so happens that The Register has its own copy of the draftt proposal, and unlike the
      New York Times, we've actually read ours. Let's just have a peek at the text. 
    
      The first observation we make is that the text states plainly, "the GSA (General Services
      Administration) is responsible for establishing the FIDNET Program Office: this includes
      creating an interagency management team from the defence, intelligence, technical, legal,
      and law-enforcement communities." 
    
      According to our reading, FBI's NIPC team will come in later, when FIDNET data gathered
      by the GSA suggest criminal activity. Again we take the unconventional approach of
      consulting the text: "FIDNET will provide raw/filtered data from network sensors and the
      Federal Computer Incident Response Capability. NIPC will continue to be responsible for
      further data processing." 
    
      We remain at a loss to explain why the NYT reported that FIDNET would "put a new and
      powerful tool into the hands of the FBI." On the contrary, it appears that the Bureau's NIPC
      will be a tool of the GSA, if and when it decides the government has been cracked. 
    
      Michael Vadis, FBI's Director of NIPC, made it clear during testimony to the Senate Y2K
      Committee yesterday that the FBI will respond only where there is evidence of a federal
      crime. 
    
      The only language we found in any way alarming was, "FIDNET will interface with the
      currently planned intrusion detection systems being developed for DOD (Department of
      Defence) and national security agencies." We didn't quite know what the pseudo-verb
      "interface" was intended to mean, but we know that American law enforcement and the
      military are forbidden to do a great deal in the way of "interfacing". As the very existence of
      America's Act of Posse Comitatus indicates a history of some difficulty in distinguishing
      between civil and military purviews, this little snippet naturally raised our eyebrows. 
    
      On this matter the Department of Justice computer crimes division declined to be helpful.
      The level of interdependence between military and non-military bodies being contemplated
      is indeed a controversial issue, but it seems unlikely that the final product will initiate military
      involvement in civilian affairs enough to invite a popular backlash. Elections are coming up,
      after all; and the FIDNET system will present itself as a tempting target for cyberterrorists if
      its management becomes odious, thereby having the ironic effect of decreasing security for
      government systems. 
    
      Assuming that the language of the proposal does get tidied up a bit, we can expect a much
      softer line in reference to DOD's role in FIDNET. This still leaves the matter of DOD
      participation in case of an emergency. The president is permitted by law to suspend the Act
      of Posse Comitatus in difficult circumstances, such as insurrection, mayhem in the
      streets, foreign invasion, or those the Y2K rollover might possibly present. A further bit of
      constitutional intrigue will undoubtedly emerge if a foreign military organization should attack
      a US civilian network related to banking, energy, transportation or some other essential
      service. It does not necessarily follow that the DOD would need access to civilian networks
      in order to reply on behalf of the USA. 
    
      Vadis for one thinks an organised attack is inevitable. He declined to go into specifics, but
      left us with the strong impression that hostile military bodies overseas are developing the
      means to disable military, government and civilian networks remotely via an internet-based
      attack. Clinton's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, said on Thursday that there exist
      "governments that we know are developing systems to get access to our computer
      systems." Not an especially comforting thought. "We know that, in fact... there have been
      intrusions into sensitive systems," Berger added. Whether or not such an attack is being
      planned, it is certain that the US government expects one. 
      We wonder if the increased level of connection among government systems needed for
      FIDNET to monitor them effectively might not lead to increased vulnerability. Whether it
      happens, or when it happens, it is sure to be a jurisdictional nightmare; and the FIDNET
      proposal does foreshadow that confusion with its own vague language. 
    
      A crucial point here is that the proposal leaked to us is in draft form and now seven weeks
      old. The Register's contact on the White House National Security Council, who goes by the
      name of "an administration official," made it clear that the final draft will not be ready for
      submission to the President until September at the earliest. The FIDNET document is at
      present quite fluid, and on its way past numerous reviewers including the Department of
      Justice computer crimes division, the General Services Administration, the Department of
      Defence, the National Security Council and the FBI. 
    
      Furthermore, our source at NSC tells us, the proposal currently being circulated does
      address and tighten up the unfortunately vague "interface" language. The level of
      involvement between DOD and non-military government agencies is intended to be little
      more than an advisory relationship and a sharing of new quirks, bugs and attack techniques
      much as "one police department might share tips with another in a different jurisdiction." 
    
      The language which led to an assumption by many that FIDNET might one day monitor
      private-sector networks is also being clarified. NSC says that there will not be even an
      opt-in programme for private users to voluntarily choose such monitoring. FIDNET will,
      however, share its tricks with private enterprise, and leave it to them to implement what it
      chooses, on its own nickel. 
    
      The Register will report fully and eagerly on the specific changes to the FIDNET proposal
      as soon as the latest version is leaked. It might actually make sense to withhold judgment
      on the piece until after it's been reviewed and polished. Just a thought. «

      Officials: Security plan on track

      In the face of privacy concerns, schedule remains unchanged

      BY DIANE FRANK (diane_frank@fcw.com)

      Despite public outcry and congressional interest, federal officials are sticking
      to their schedule for developing and releasing a plan to protect the federal
      information infrastructure from cyberattacks. 

      Several stories in the media last week inaccurately reported that the draft of the
      National Plan for Information Systems Protection would put the FBI in charge
      of monitoring private-sector and government networks for cyberattacks through
      the Federal Intrusion Detection Network (Fidnet). 

      This touched off protests from public-interest groups about citizens' privacy, and
      several members of Congress asked for a complete copy of the draft and a
      briefing in the next few weeks. 

      Officials from the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO), the
      National Infrastructure Protection Center and other high-level federal groups
      involved in creating the plan said the attention to what is still an internal
      document under development will not change anything. 

      "This will have no effect on the process," one senior National Security Council
      official said. "It is just now completing the second round of comments from the
      agencies and industry...and will be brought to the president in October." 

      Others stressed that the plan deals only with federal networks and that the
      privacy and civil rights of Americans are being taken into account at every step.

      "An important element of the Fidnet program is a legal review by the Justice
      Department," said John Tritak, director of the CIAO. The plan also is being
      reviewed by the chief counselor for privacy at the Office of Management and
      Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and those reviews may
      change the current version of the plan, he said. 

      In fact, the first version of the plan has already been reviewed by the Office of
      the Assistant Attorney General, which determined it was completely legal,
      according to a senior DOJ official.

      The plan is based on the critical infrastructure protection plans from agencies
      and industry required by Presidential Decision Directive 63 and originally was
      scheduled to be sent to Congress and the president this fall, Tritak said.

      It also includes programs for education and training of information security
      professionals, research and development of computer security profits, and the
      basis for revisions of current laws to "promote greater information sharing,
      enhance systems security, and strengthen protections for civil liberties and
      privacy."

      Although members of Congress has known about the plan for some time, most
      did not realize its extent, and that is partly what touched off a request from Sen.
      Bob Bennett (R-Utah) to receive a copy of the plan, said a spokesman for the
      senator.

12.0 Computer `crackers' set sights on .gov for chaos

     Computer `crackers' set sights on .gov for chaos
     by Mark Mueller 

     Sunday, August 1, 1999

     It was the kind of threat for which computer hackers are famous, a
     declaration of war dripping with the risk-free bravado so common on
     the anonymous Internet.

     The warning, which appeared on a hacked Web page of the U.S.
     Interior Department in late May, promised unrelenting attacks against
     government computers to avenge an FBI roundup of hackers
     associated with the group Global Hell. Just weeks earlier, Global Hell
     had claimed responsibility for an attack on the White House's main
     Web page.

     ``Now, it's our turn to hit them where it hurts by going after every
     computer on the Net with a .gov,'' the message read. ``We'll keep
     hitting them until they get down on their knees and beg.''

     That the threat was made - risking the pique of the FBI - isn't as
     surprising as the follow-through. In recent months, hackers, or
     crackers, as bad-guy hackers are known, have indeed blazed through
     a wide swath of government and university computers, defacing some
     Web sites and shutting down others.

     Among the high-profile targets: the U.S. Senate (twice), the Army,
     the Navy and the Departments of Agriculture, Labor and the Interior.
     Computer systems also were hit at Georgetown University, the
     University of Colorado, the University of Michigan and Harvard
     University.

     The most brazen of the attacks targeted the lion's den itself: the FBI
     Web page, which was out of service for nearly a week as
     programmers beefed up security on the site.

     Jim Settle, former chief of the FBI's computer crimes squad and now
     an Internet security consultant, calls the FBI strike ``an out-and-out
     declaration of electronic warfare.''

     For some, it's a war that can't afford to be lost. The feeble network
     that once was the domain of a few scientists is now a robust and
     far-reaching behemoth that caters to hundreds of millions of people,
     some of whom pay their taxes, buy goods and send intensely personal
     information through their computers.

     In the wrong hands, such information could prove embarrassing or
     costly. Seen in its most sinister light, computer intrusion is a threat to
     national security.

     But the self-proclaimed ``warriors'' who carried out the recent
     attacks against government Web sites hardly sound like cyberspace
     shock troops.

     Their loose-knit groups bear names like the ``Keebler Elves,'' the
     ``Masters of Downloading'' and ``Hacking for Girlies.''

     When they hack sites, they traditionally leave behind inane scrawlings
     - ``Boo! Did we scare you?'' - and ``shout-outs'' to their friends.

     Those familiar with the hacking subculture say such groups are
     generally composed of teens - and occasionally people in their early
     20s - with a lot of computer equipment and too much time on their
     hands.

     ``These are just immature kids doing this from their home
     computers,'' said John Vranesevich, founder of Anti-Online, a group
     that tracks hacker activity and that has compiled dossiers on 6,000
     hackers. ``It's a game to them. They make a move, and they can't
     contemplate how it affects people in the real world. It's not reality
     until the FBI bangs on their door.''

     Vranesevich called the recent wave of attacks a ``temper tantrum''
     over the May FBI raids, in which agents confiscated computer
     equipment and questioned teens in 11 cities, including Houston,
     Seattle and San Diego. A spokeswoman for the FBI in Boston said the
     New England office was not involved in the operation.

     Those who deface Web sites - about 1,300 sites have been defaced
     so far this year, according to the most reliable statistics - justify their
     actions by arguing they're actually doing companies and organizations
     a service by pointing out security deficiencies.

     But law enforcement authorities and others who deal with hackers
     dismiss the argument.

     ``I don't buy it,'' said Drew Williams, the founder of an AXENT
     Technologies' SWAT team to deal with hacker attacks. ``Any hacker
     group that has not been invited to test security is committing a
     crime.''

     That assessment is shared by David Green, deputy chief of the
     computer crimes and intellectual property section at the Justice
     Department.

     ``This is not just electronic graffiti,'' Green said. ``They're shutting
     down access to Web sites, sometimes for hours, sometimes for days,
     and it makes it impossible for people who want access to that Web
     source to get it.''

     Moreover, there's far more at risk than down time for Web servers,
     contends Peter Mell, who conducts hacker research for the National
     Institute of Standards and Technology, a division of the U.S.
     Commerce Department.

     ``Real harm can be done,'' Mell said. ``A lot of people download their
     tax forms from the IRS today. What if someone broke into the IRS
     Web server and changed just a single number? It would cause
     supreme chaos.''

     Mell also pointed to electronic banking and stock trading, saying Web
     servers today handle increasing amounts of sensitive information.

     ``This isn't child's play anymore,'' he said. ``I pay my bills online. I
     trade stocks online. In that kind of environment, I can't afford people
     breaking into computers.''

     The FBI heartily agrees, though it has not characterized its
     crackdown on hackers in quite the grandiose terms that hackers do.

     ``We don't have a war against hackers. We're following our mandate,
     which is to investigate violations of federal law,'' said Bill Carter, a
     spokesman for the FBI's headquarters in Washington. ``The fact that
     these hackers or hacker groups have their noses out of joint over
     this, we can't help that.''

     Most hackers are not caught, but the recent raids suggest the FBI is
     starting to get better at tracking them. The agency has about 500
     open computer crimes cases at any given time.

     But the federal agents' methods - charging in with warrants and
     bulletproof vests - worries some in the hacking community.

     ``For those of us in the scene for a number of years, it's starting to
     get scary only because we worry it's going to turn into a witch hunt,''
     said Space Rogue, a member of the Boston-area group L0pht Heavy
     Industries, a former hacker clan that now bills itself as an electronic
     think tank.

     ``While defacements will probably continue no matter what law
     enforcement officials do, it would be very easy for the government to
     just start executing search warrants left and right, seizing computers
     and scaring people half to death.''

     Internet watchdogs - and some hackers themselves - say that while
     the crackdown should continue, the real issue is computer security.

     Space Rogue argues that nearly all Web page defacements are
     carried out with known security flaws in software. As an example, he
     said, his group e-mailed the Army's webmaster about a flaw in its
     ColdFusion server software a month before someone used the hole to
     hack into the Army's Web site.

     ``It comes down to the person in charge of the machine and whether
     they're taking their security seriously,'' Space Rogue said. ``This sort
     of thing never should have happened in the first place.''

     Settle, the former FBI computer crimes chief, says the danger will be
     far greater when those doing the hacking aren't teens out for kicks
     but terrorists intent on electronic warfare.

     ``Our computer systems today are like cars operating without safety
     equipment: no headlights, no bumpers, no airbags, no roofs,'' he said.
     ``Heck, if teenagers can do this, what can sophisticated intelligence
     operatives do? This is just a taste of things to come.''

     The government acknowledges as much.

     In testimony before a congressional panel, government security
     experts said government computers are easy marks because
     employees lack training, because well-trained staff flee for the bigger
     paycheck of the private sector and because internal security
     procedures often aren't followed.

     ``Most federal agencies continue to lack the ability to detect against
     and recover from cyber attacks,'' U.S. Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.),
     chair of the House Science Subcommittee on Technology, said at the
     June 23 hearing.

     To combat the deficiency, the Clinton administration last week
     proposed spending $1.5 billion in the next fiscal year on a
     sophisticated intruder warning system that would be installed on
     military, government and private-sector computer networks by 2003.

     Operating something like a burglar alarm, the system would detect
     break-ins, funneling that information to a central location.

     ``A concerted attack on the computers of any one of our key
     economic sectors or governmental agencies could have catastrophic
     effects,'' Clinton wrote in a draft cover letter accompanying the
     proposal.

     Civil libertarians and Internet privacy watchdogs already have
     protested the plan, saying it will give the government unprecedented
     surveillance powers, equipping authorities with the tools to peruse the
     private dispatches of the masses.

     House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) joined in the criticism,
     deriding the plan as an opportunity for ``government peeping toms.''

     No matter the government response, hackers will, no doubt, continue
     mounting challenges, probing for deficiencies in networks and deriding
     those who chase them.

     ``You can stop one, but you can not stop all,'' hackers wrote when
     they defaced the U.S. Senate Web page for the second time in late
     June.

     A more recent defacement of an obscure Venezuelan Web page
     repeated the theme, carrying a ``call to arms'' imploring competing
     hacker groups to unite to ``win this war.''

     ``Remember, this is our world, not the government's,'' the page read.

     Time will tell.

     Prosecuted `cracker' a martyr to techies

     In hacker circles, he is a modern-day martyr, a technological tinkerer
     whose attacks on other people's computers amounted to harmless
     exploration before the FBI swooped down on him, dubbing him Online
     Enemy No. 1.

     To prosecutors and to judges, he is a dangerous miscreant whose
     ability to crack computer systems and whose propensity for running
     from the law required that he be held without bail.

     Kevin Mitnick, for four years the cause celebre of the Internet's dark
     side, could soon be going free.

     Mitnick, 35, who pleaded guilty in March to multiple counts of
     computer and wire fraud for breaking into systems and stealing
     software from such companies as Sun Microsystems, Novell, Motorola
     and Nokia, will be sentenced Aug. 9 under a plea agreement that
     could, with good behavior credits, allow him to leave federal prison
     within weeks.

     ``Kevin is optimistic that this case will be over and that he can get
     on with his life,'' said Mitnick's lawyer, Donald C. Randolph of Santa
     Monica, Calif.

     But even if Mitnick himself fades into obscurity, his cause is unlikely
     to follow. In the hacking community, Mitnick long ago became a
     symbol of what hackers term gross government over-reaction, a
     theme repeatedly hammered home by Randolph.

     ``The government prosecution of Mr. Mitnick was to carry out an
     agenda launched by them in the 1990s,'' Randolph said.

     ``The government wanted to demonstrate they were going to be
     tough on computer terrorism. Unfortunately, the government did not
     have a bonafide computer terrorist to prosecute, so they went after
     Mr. Mitnick, a recreational hacker who was arrested with a big splash
     and who became a convenient target.''

     Randolph's comments could be dismissed as the arguments of a
     defense lawyer looking to gain sympathy for his client, but he's not
     the only one making them.

     Drew Williams, who founded Axent Technologies' SWAT team to
     respond to hacking incidents for clients, said the government
     miscalculated with Mitnick.

     ``I am not a Mitnick supporter at all. However, I think the
     government did in fact set out to make an example and instead made
     a martyr,'' Williams said. ``An individual's rights to due process
     probably got a little trampled.''

     Denied bail on charges that could have initially landed him in jail for a
     century, Mitnick appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,
     where the justices declined to hear his lawyer's argument that bail
     should be set.

     Hackers have seized on the bail issue, leaving ``Free Kevin''
     messages on the Web sites they hack. Recent examples include the
     home pages of the U.S. Senate and Greenpeace, where hackers left
     the tongue-in-cheek message ``Free Mitnick or we will club 600 baby
     seals.''

     There is also a ``Free Kevin'' Web site (www.freekevin.com) that
     gives Mitnick updates and carries a confinement clock showing - to
     the second - how long Mitnick has been jailed.

     Randolph argues that while people should be prosecuted for breaking
     into systems, the law needs to be refined to distinguish between
     recreational hackers and information terrorists.

     ``I do not quarrel at all with the government's right to prosecute
     computer fraud and to go after computer terrorists, but it's high time
     they distinguish between high crimes and misdemeanors so they're
     not trumpeting the arrest of the century when the suspect is a kid on
     a laptop,'' Randolph said.

     Mitnick's prosecutors insist they have not overreached, that Mitnick
     caused millions in damage by stealing and changing information in
     computer systems.

     ``This is someone whose conduct over a 2-year period was very
     broad and very serious,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter
     said. ``He hit a huge number of companies with a lot of damage. He
     is not the victim.''

     If Mitnick does win his freedom soon, it could be short-lived. The Los
     Angeles County District Attorney's Office is preparing its own case
     against him on charges similar to the federal claim.

     Randolph said he's confident Mitnick, in the end, will prevail.

     ``In 1995, the press and the public were fooled into thinking Kevin
     Mitnick was this cyber bogeyman,'' he said. ``That type of argument
     doesn't fly in 1999. People know better.''

     Sites that have been targeted

     Here's a partial list of Web sites that have been attacked in recent
     months. In most cases, the sites were defaced. In others, a flood of
     requests for service overwhelmed Web servers, rendering them
     unusable. In several of the attacks, the intruders called the acts
     revenge for FBI ``harassment'' of hackers.

13.0 IIS Server 'hackproof'? 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

      contributed by Code Kid 
      A small company in Sydney Australia, called Creative
      Digital Technology, has claimed to have created
      software that will make web pages on IIS Servers 'hack
      proof'. The software, known as SecurePage digitally
      signs all pages and then compares those signatures
      against encrypted master copies. If the signature
      changes then the web server will stop serving the page.
      They have issued a challenge to get people to try and
      break the system, however, the information on the
      challenge is difficult to find.

      Developer issues hacker challenge
      By JENNIFER FORESHEW

      A SMALL Sydney company that has developed software designed to
      make Web sites hack-proof, has thrown out a challenge to crack the
      technology. 
    
      Creative Digital Technology (CDT) has developed software which, when
      downloaded, makes a site secure. 
    
      "We are prepared to stand behind that financially by offering a prize to
      universities to see if they can do what our developers haven't been
      able to do," CDT chief operating officer Philip Burton said. 
    
      CDT, which developed the country's first SET (Secure Electronic
      Transaction) enabled products, is launching the SecurePage product at
      Internet World 99 this week. 
    
      "We can protect any Web site," CDT chief executive Bahram Boutorabi
      said. "The first version of the product runs on Microsoft's Internet
      Information Server platform, but we are planning to roll out across all
      platforms." 
    
      Mr Boutorabi, who is also technology officer, said many sites could be
      hacked because they were developed using mostly straight text. 
    
      "We have developed the technology to put something into Active
      Server Pages, HTML, Net Commerce Mark-up Language and XML, which
      represents a signature that someone has made against that page," Mr
      Boutorabi said. 
    
      Any attempt to alter a Web site's content would result in action being
      taken by the system, which is protected by 192-bit, Triple-DES
      encryption. 
    
      "If the contents of that page have been altered for any reason it will
      stop serving that content out and serve it from its own content area,
      where everything is fully encrypted," Mr Boutorabi said. 
    
      "SecurePage enables an administrator to put a disc into the system, run
      the administration and tell it to sign all of the pages with their
      password. 
    
      "To alter the code or text, you have to have administrative access to
      change the content or to stop the system." 
    
      Mr Burton, who is also a senior partner in CDT, said the company began
      working on the technology after attacks on high-profile Web sites. 
    
      "This came about from evidence that significant Web sites were being
      hacked and destroyed. 
    
      "We believed we could deliver a protection device in software form that
      could be downloaded from our Web site by whoever was hosting that
      particular site. 
    
      CDT declined to reveal further details of the technology pending
      approval of a patent on SecurePage. 
    
      If you decide to take up CDT's challenge to crack its software,
      Computers & High Technology wants to know. E-mail us at
      auscomp@ozemail.com.au û but only if you are successful.

      [Sydney, AUSTRALIA] Several Australian companies have used the Internet World Australia 99 exhibition to launch new
      products. 

      Sydney-based startup Pure Commerce has introduced Pure Global Pay, a payment gateway service which can accept 32 different
      currencies without merchants needing to establish relationships with non-Australian banks. 

      E-commerce developer Creative Digital Technology is debuting two software applications: a wallet which supports the Secure
      Electronic Transactions (SET) standard for e-commerce transactions called ActiveWallet, and a solution for attempts by hackers to
      deface corporate Web sites called SecurePage. 

      The ActiveWallet client is an 850KB client-side applet which enables consumers to pay bills and buy products using credit cards in
      a drag and drop environment. The client is designed to support transactions using the SET-certified merchant server technology of
      US-based GlobeSet. 

      SecurePage attaches digital signatures to static Web pages and dynamically generated components so that they can be compared
      against an encrypted master version to check if they have been altered by malicious hackers. 

      Allaire has also used Internet World as its Australian launch for Spectra, its Web content management product. 

      The show has also coincided with the announcement that US-based analyst firm Jupiter Communications had filed preliminary
      documents for an IPO. Wednesday keynote speaker Gene De Rose, who is CEO and 21.8 per cent stake holder of Jupiter, is
      poised to become the next Internet multi-millionaire. 

      The Internet World 99 Best of Show product awards, judged by journalists at Internet World Australia magazine, will be
      announced on Wednesday.

      
      
     
14.0 Latest CWD Pokes at AntiOnline

     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Weld Pond 
      The CyberWire Dispatch, a mailing list newsletter, has
      some very interesting things to say about John
      Vranesevich and Antionline. CWD writer Lewis Z. Koch
      makes some powerful observations about his past
      dealings with and the writings of Mr. Vranesevich. (If

      CyberWire Dispatch // August 1999
      // All Rights Reserved

      Jacking in from the "Pine-Sol" port:
      By Lewis Z. Koch
      CWD Special Correspondent

      Twenty-year-old John Vranesevich calls his AntiOnline
      Web site "a valuable tool in the fight against 'CyberCrime'"
      In a call to arms, this self-anointed, junior G-man
      wannabe, promises to uncover, reveal and inform on
      hackers and other miscreants. 

      Out of this misguided cyber-vigilantism, arises the
      "denunciator" virus, which reaches its full lethality in
      totalitarian states but also finds a home in democratic
      societies as well, usually in climates of social resentment,
      political fanaticism, or, my personal favorite, political
      self-righteousness.

      The Denunciator virus, known also as the "Accuser" virus,
      destroys careers, leaves permanent scars, called
      "blacklists," gives rise to false alarms, warnings or
      contrived "cautionary tales" meant to lull or divert
      citizens. The natural host for this virus is believed to be a
      species of the rodent called a "snitch," aka squealer, stool
      pigeon, informer; rat bastard.

      Every delusional crusader needs a mission statement,
      Vranesevich is no different. This self-anointed
      sheriff-of-cyberspace pens this Uber-warning to hackers:

      "I know that some of you are playing what you feel is a
      game. A game that you think you are winning. Some of
      you sit back and laugh at organizations like the FBI. You
      make sure that you provide enough information to make it
      obvious who you are, yet are careful not to provide
      enough information to actually have it proven. I have
      been watching you these past 5 years. I know how you
      do the things you do, why you do the things you do, and I
      know who you are."

      And if you're keeping score-and you should be-you'll note
      that Vranesenvich apparently started down this crusader
      road at the tender age of 15 or just about the time he
      figured his Johnson could be used for more than simple
      utilitarian bodily functions. 

      This not-very subtle paean to cyber-vigilantism could
      easily be dismissed save for the fact that Vranesenvich
      has earned a demi-celebrity status from journalists
      working for publications from which we have come to
      expect more judicious sourcing, including, but not limited
      to, Matt Richtel of The New York Times, John Schwartz of
      The Washington Post and even, sadly, CWD's own Brock
      Meeks while cloaked in his alter-ego as Washington
      correspondent for MSNBC.

      And we wonder why fewer and fewer people trust the
      media.

      Hung With His Own Rope
      =====================

      In his mission statement Vranesevich unequivocally
      states, "I've seen myself talking with people who have
      broken into hundreds of governmental servers, stolen
      sensitive data from military sites, broken into atomic
      research centers."

      Question is, can we believe him?

      There's his rather perplexing story about hackers breaking
      into an "Israeli" atomic research center. 

      At first, as Vranesevich tells it, when hackers told him
      what they had done, he "freaked" even thought the boast
      might be "far fetched." But these hackers sent him a
      "folder full of documents written in a foreign language"
      they claimed they had copied from the "B'Hadvah" Atomic
      Research Center. [Note: Vranesevich didn't know how to
      spell the name of the so-called research center].

      "Were the documents in Hebrew or English?" I asked.

      "Bengali."

      When he broke the "story" on his AntiOnline web site, all
      media hell broke loose. 

      "Every mainstream media started calling and questioning
      and calling the research center," Vranesevich said. "I had
      all these nuclear arms proliferation people calling. Here I
      am in my parent's living room, and one day, thirteen calls
      from anti-nuclear proliferation and pro-nuclear proliferation
      (sic) groups wanting to know - is this significant, what is
      Israel doing?"

      I was still having a problem with the "Bengali" aspect to
      the documents.

      "Ah, John," I asked, "is this an Israeli research center or
      could it be Indian? Pakistani?"

      Silence. Then Vranesevich said, "I think it's Indian. Who
      was the one that just did the nuclear testing?"

      "That was India and Pakistan, not Israel."

      "Oh, then this was India, not Israel."

      Oh. 

      Then there's his story about changing medical
      records-pretty serious stuff. Can we take him at his word
      there?

      "[I]'ve seen people change the medical records of
      individuals in our armed services" Vranesevich asserts in
      his "mission" statement. 

      When asked about these nefarious deeds, Vranesevich
      works himself up into a high dudgeon about hackers
      breaking into sites and changing medical records.

      "What would have happened if medical records had been
      changed and a cancer patient received the wrong
      treatment for it?...What if I had looked into who these
      [hacker] guys were, a little further? What would have
      happened if I would have published the story? What would
      have happened if CERT had come out and said medical
      records had been changed and a cancer patient received
      the wrong treatment because of it!" 

      I questioned him closely. "You really saw people change
      the medical records of individuals in our armed forces?" 

      "I don't mean that literally," backtracking as fast as his
      voice could carry him. "You see the language I was using?
      I don't mean literally 'I saw them do it, I saw it happen.'
      It's something that transgressed (sic) before. It's like we
      saw our country go through three wars. It doesn't mean I
      caused (sic) the three wars. You see what I'm saying? Or
      I've seen crime happen over and over again in my
      neighborhood. Doesn't mean I literally saw it. You know
      what I mean? I don't know if I'm making myself clear." Ah,
      er.. right. He gave it one more chance.

      "Looking back in retrospect (sic). It was like actions that
      transgressed (sic) before. I've sort of watched the events
      transfold (sic) before my eyes."

      Yep, that clears it up; someone get this guy an English
      tutor...There's more like that but after a while it gets,
      well, boring.

      Vranesevich also claims a "semi-contractual" relationship
      with all kinds of official military and police types, including
      one with the NASA and one with the Defense Information
      Systems Agency (DISA). 

      Can we believe him? 

      NASA says no. After checking with their databases "they
      could find no record of NASA having done business with
      Mr. Vranesevich or his company AntiOnline," reports
      Patricia M. Riep-Dice, NASA Freedom of Information Act
      Officer. 

      According to a DISA spokesman, no such relationship
      exists. None. Nada.

      In Other People's Words
      =======================

      In his grasp for distinction, celebrityhood, acclaim,
      Vranesevich overreaches, as he did with his claim of
      unethical behavior on the part of computer security expert
      Marcus Ranum. Ranum's "crime"? "Guilt-by-association"
      with two hacker groups, L0pht Heavy Industries and cult
      of the Dead cow (cDc).

      L0pht Heavy Industries is among the finest Microsoft
      error-catchers in the world; it is a company with
      employees and it pays taxes. "cult of the Dead cow" is a
      group of hackers in the tradition of Yippie founders Abbie
      "Steal This Book" Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.

      The cDc promises Internet chaos, anarchy and terror; in
      1968, in Chicago, Abby Hoffman and Jerry Rubin
      threatened to pour LSD in the water and send Yippie
      studs to O'Hare airport to seduce the wives of delegates
      to the Democratic National Convention. If that analogy is
      lost on you, cut your losses now, stop reading and return
      to your "Internet for Dummies" workbook.

      L0pht and cDc tend to despise Microsoft, but then so do a
      lot of people, including folks in the Justice Department.
      More than likely there is cross-over contact between
      L0pht and cDc since the two have much in common, in
      the same way journalists from different newspapers and
      television tend to hang out at the same bars, buy each
      other drinks and complain about stupidity and venality of
      their editors.

      cDc had been tinkering around the multiplicity of holes,
      vulnerabilities and general screw ups in the Microsoft
      Windows operating system. They developed a
      back-dooring program for Win 95, one that allowed a
      Trojan Horse to exploit that vulnerability. 

      In a stroke of genius that would make an Wizard of
      Madison Avenue green with envy, they dubbed the
      program "Back Orifice." 

      Ranum developed a program to counteract Back Orifice
      and called it "Back Officer Friendly." Vranesevich claims he
      was "shocked, shocked" to discover that Ranum might
      have had conversations with hackers at L0pht, perhaps
      even some at cDc about Back Officer Friendly.

      Vranesevich's story alleged that Ranum could have even
      been talking with the very people at cDc who developed
      the exploit in the first place. So what do we have here?
      Collusion? Duplicity? Ethical lapse? Double-agentry?

      Whom to believe?
      ================

      Bell Labs' William R. Cheswick, co-author with Steven
      Bellovin of the exemplary "Firewalls and Internet Security -
      Repelling the Wily Hacker," says of Ranum: "I have worked
      with Marcus for years. He is a strong force for Good
      against Evil. A security person is paid to think bad
      thoughts, and Marcus is quite good at it. The key is that
      he doesn't do the bad stuff, but uses this approach to
      make things safer." 

      Bellovin, himself a world-class computer expert, certainly
      doesn't equivocate. Ranum has "been a strong, positive
      force for Internet security, both in the sense of building
      useful tools and in the sense of teaching other people
      important principles. I've also never heard any serious
      question about his ethics." 

      "Marcus has one of the most fluent understandings of
      Internet security I have ever seen," says Bruce Schneier,
      whose books on encryption and on privacy can trigger a
      physical and intellectual hernia, "his ability to see threats
      and attacks, defenses and countermeasures, makes him
      one of the most valuable resources we have in computer
      security world," Schneier said. Marcus' "association with
      the L0pht recognizes that there is considerable expertise
      in the hacking community that can be leveraged in the
      fight against computer crime. Marcus is just smarter than
      other people, because he realized it and figured out how
      to use it No kidding; he's that good." 

      So you do the math: self appointed cybervigilante John
      Vranesevich, with his stolen "Israeli" atomic secrets
      written in Bengali, changed medical records that weren't
      changed, unsubstantiated relationships with NASA and
      DISA (and that's just for openers), and, on the other
      hand, Marcus Ranum and people like Cheswick, Bellovin,
      and Schneier.

      The best way to deal with "Denunciator" virus is simply
      silence; don't feed the hype.

     Symantec: Vandals didn't infect us
     By Robert Lemos, ZDNN
     August 2, 1999 2:02 PM PT
     URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2307804,00.html
     
     Internet vandals broke into the servers of network security and utilities firm Symantec Corp.
     Monday morning, defacing the company's Web site. 
     
     While the vandals claimed to have infected Symantec's network two months ago with a worm,
     quaintly dubbed Bloworm, the company denied Monday that any worm existed on its systems. 
     
     "There is no virus infection, no worm infection, and no danger to customers," said Richard
     Saunders, a spokesman for the Cupertino, Calif., company. 
     
     "They didn't get in beyond posting a mildly offensive, but otherwise impotent, message on our
     home page." 
     
     The five cyber vandals, who identified themselves only by their handles, claimed otherwise. "0ur
     w0rm iz spreading around (Symantec's) netw0rk and infecting (it's) f1lez, since about 2 months
     ago. phear," stated the group in a document of typically spelling-impaired hacker-speak. The
     document was left behind by the group after it broke into the servers of Symantec at about 5 a.m.
     PT Monday. 
     
     Worms are virus-like programs that infect systems through networks automatically and without the
     need for an unknowing user to open a file or run an application. 
     
     Symantec (Nasdaq:SYMC) has always been a popular target for Internet vandals looking for a
     hard nut to crack. The only difference: This time someone actually got in. 
     
     "What this incident does show is that you cannot be complacent towards this kind of threat," said
     Saunders. The Symantec spokesman could not detail how the cyber vandals entered the
     company's network. 
     
     Symantec engineers took down the page within an hour of its posting, but not before the media in
     Europe got wind of the defacement. The BBC posted a story early Monday morning.

      The Federal Communications Commission is holding up
      critical operating licenses for several small satellite
      phone companies until they have finished talking with
      the FBI. The CALEA Act passed in 1994 requires
      telephone companies to provide law enforcement with
      access to digital call information, including the ability to
      tap calls and determine the location of users. Several
      satellite phone companies are in long negotions with the
      FBI to ensure that their systems comply with the law.

      FBI wiretap worries slow satellite phones 
      By John Borland
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com

      The Federal Bureau of Investigation is putting the brakes--at least temporarily--on the satellite phone industry. 
      
      The FBI and other U.S. law enforcement agencies are worried that new space-based telephone systems, which theoretically allow a person to use a wireless phone
      from virtually anywhere on earth, will undermine their ability to wiretap telephone calls and trace criminals through cellphones. 
      
      Federal communications officials are holding up critical operating licenses for Globalstar and a handful of smaller satellite phone services while they negotiate with the
      FBI over wiretapping issues. 
      
      "These are borderless systems," said Mac Jeffery, a spokesman for Globalstar, a satellite phone provider scheduled to launch service in North America by the end of
      this year. "But it's not really a borderless world from the legal perspective yet." 
      
      Globalstar, Iridium, and a handful of other companies are leading an ambitious push to create a network of satellites that compete with traditional cellular phone
      service. The industry has already run into growing pains--Iridium, the first and largest system to launch, has run into severe financial difficulties after falling short of
      subscriber goals. 
      
      The wiretapping issue affects these companies and a handful of other non U.S.-based smaller satellite phone providers which are seeking licenses to operate in the
      United States, but have land-based equipment located in Canada. 
      
      A 1994 U.S. law, dubbed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), requires telephone companies to provide law enforcement with
      access to digital call information, including the ability to tap calls and determine the location of users. 
      
      That law has proven controversial. Privacy rights groups have protested that the FBI is encroaching on citizens' rights in their push to tap phone calls. Meanwhile, the
      FBI has said that industry proposals for following the law don't go far enough. The Federal Communications Commission has yet to make a final ruling on the laws. 
      
      The FBI's concerns with satellite phone providers do include figuring out how they fit into this law's framework, said one department official. But the Bureau's
      concerns are larger and more immediate, which has led to the current delay in licensing the services. 
      
      Some of these satellite systems are unable to provide information on a caller's location. This information is critical for law enforcement, the FBI says, so it can know
      whether or not it can legally seek a U.S. court order to tap the phone calls. 
      
      Canada's TMI Communications, which has seen its U.S. license application languish in the FCC for close to 16 months, faces this objection. Department of Justice
      officials are reportedly asking the company to include some kind of global positioning system in TMI phones that would at least determine which country a caller was
      in. 
      
      TMI executives confirmed that they are discussing possible ways to solve the dilemma with U.S. law enforcement officials, but would not comment further. 
      
      Because its system is configured differently, Globalstar doesn't face this issue. But because it wants to set up two of its four land-based receiving stations in Canada,
      it is in a different--and perhaps more technically challenging--situation. 
      
      The FBI is concerned that it would have to go through Canadian government officials to win a wiretap on any calls going through these stations--an idea it strongly
      opposes. Allowing information about surveillance operations to go through foreign government channels would be a serious violation of national security, one FBI
      official said. 
      
      All the companies involved are negotiating these issues with the FBI, and have each proposed a series of technical and policy solutions to the problem unique to their
      own networks. But according to Washington sources, senior trade and law enforcement officials from Canada and the United States have also discussed the
      problem, with an eye to settling national security concerns on a policy level with a minimum impact on industry development. 
      
      Meanwhile, the FCC is waiting and watching. The FBI and the Department of Justice have no official power to hold up the companies' operating licenses, but
      regulators are waiting for a resolution to the talks anyway. 
      
      "The parties are discussing this," said one FCC official, who asked to remain anonymous. "In the absence of indications that this is not moving forward, we would
      like to give that process a chance to work." 
      
      The dispute is similar to the fight being waged by U.S. software companies, who are barred from exporting strong encryption programs overseas. The FBI has
      lobbied to bar these exports--and has advocated for stricter rules governing use of encryption inside the United States--arguing that law enforcement needs to be
      able to crack encryption on encoded email messages of criminals and terrorists. 
      
      As with the software companies, the satellite firms are taking a conciliatory stance, hoping to get federal approval before the issue begins cutting into their official
      launch date. Globalstar, which is slated to go live in North America by the end of this year, says it doesn't expect the issue to push that date back. 
      
      "Obviously some modifications are going to be made in order to make sure that national security is intact," said Andy Radlow, a spokesman for Vodafone AirTouch,
      the company handling Globalstar's North American business. "But we don't foresee launch delays."

18.0 InfoCriminals Should Face Reasonable Penalties

      A very interesting opinion piece in Sunday's San Jose
      Mercury News asks some very poignant questions. The
      article calls for reasonable sentences for InfoCriminals,
      methods to be developed so that they are caught and
      says that companies should be held just as responsible
      as InfoCriminals for security violations. (This is the first
      time I have seen the word "InfoCriminals" used. I like
      it.)

      Setting the trap for hackers
      A truly rational criminal system would provide
      near-certainty that transgressors would be caught -- and
      punish companies with lax security
 
      BY STEPH MARR
 
      THE recent spate of viruses has put us back on red alert -- the bad
      boys are still out there. And if they're caught, like David L. Smith, the
      alleged father of ``Melissa,'' they may face ridiculously high penalties
      -- penalties that are way out of line with their actual threat to society. 
 
      However, these penalties are necessary in order to establish some
      semblance of deterrence, because the probability of getting caught is
      near zero. We need to increase that probability. 
 
      Here's a formula that explains why we seem unable to stop hackers
      and other computer criminals: The value of a crime equals the penalty
      times the risk of getting caught. 
 
      The concept is simple. If the value of the ``prize'' is higher than the
      penalty multiplied by the risk of getting caught, most hackers will go
      for it. For example, if a hacker breaks into a bank's server and steals
      $1 million and the penalty for the crime is 10 years, it's worth it if the
      risk of getting caught is near zero. You do the math.
 
      A truly rational criminal system would provide near-certainty that
      transgressors would be caught. When caught, they would receive a
      penalty that is precisely commensurate with their crime. 
 
      For example, if a hacker breaks into a bank's computer and steals $1
      million, that's bank robbery. There are currently laws that address
      bank robbery and the penalties that apply. Similarly, if hacking occurs
      over state lines, wouldn't that constitute interstate transportation of
      stolen property? My point is that rather than apply grossly overstated
      penalties to an InfoCrime, we should simply apply the penalties
      already established for ``real world'' parallels. 
 
      But this only works if the criminals are likely to be caught -- which is
      not where we are today. In recent years, few InfoCriminals have been
      caught and punished. To address this, we need responsible parties --
      such as the government, private institutions and computer vendors --
      to introduce greater risk into the hacker equation. 
 
      The first step would be to encourage better record keeping of who
      does what, and when. For example, handling virus problems could be
      comparatively easy if we refused to run ``anonymous'' programs.
      Microsoft has built this ability into its browser, as have others. It's a
      simple matter to set the system to refuse to run code that doesn't have
      a known source. 
 
      Furthermore, we need to foster a system whereby critical information,
      such as medical or financial records, simply cannot be accessed
      without a clear record of precisely who did what and when. 
 
      This is the responsibility of the medical or the financial communities.
      We need legislation to require these organizations to take strong
      measures to protect information kept about us, or for us. Some
      information may be collected as a normal part of transacting business
      with any organization, but limits on the use of that information need to
      be in place. 
 
      It is the responsibility of businesses and institutions to safeguard the
      information we give them. If they fail to do so, they should be
      penalized, along with the hackers. If a high-school student can crack
      the Pentagon, then both the student and the Pentagon should be held
      accountable. If the Pentagon can't defend against our own students,
      how are they ever going to stand up to a true InfoWar from a foreign
      government? 
 
      Companies should be required to have their information security
      systems audited on a regular basis, just as they have their books
      audited. And, just as incorrect bookkeeping can lead to civil and
      criminal penalties, so too should information security errors. 
 
      For example, if it can be proved that a company could easily have
      done a better job of security, the company itself -- in addition, of
      course, to the hacker -- should be punished. Fines could be collected
      from the company to compensate those people whose information
      was lost or stolen. This is the only way we can make information
      security -- and the safety of our private information -- a standard
      business practice.
 
      We need the vendors of consumer products to be held accountable
      for the products they create. If Intuit is going to be in the business of
      selling consumer financial management software, it should be
      responsible for building in the safeguards and the protections that are
      appropriate for that information. If Microsoft is going to be in the
      business of selling consumer operating systems, it should be
      responsible for providing an environment which is robust, free from
      known defects and protects consumer information, by default. Users
      should be free to accept additional risks, but it should be informed
      consent. 
 
      Responsible software and responsible institutions would eliminate
      hacking without risk. Then we can move on to creating realistic
      penalties for InfoCrimes.

      L0pht Heavy Industries has announced that they are
      developing a line of professional plugins for the robust
      remote administration tool BO2K. The first of these
      plugins BOTOOL was released yesterday. BOTOOL allows
      the administrator to remotely manage files and the
      remote registry. This allows you to upload and download
      files securely, as well as copy, rename and delete files
      and directories. The remote registry editor allows you
      full registry editing capabilities over the BO2K secure
      command channel.

      L0pht releases first BO2K plug-in

      The controversial Back Orifice 2000 has some company. 

      On Tuesday, the white-hat hacking think-tank L0pht Heavy Industries posted its first of
      three plug-ins for the program, which has been alternately called a remote administration 
      application or a hacking tool, depending on the user's point of view. 

      Called BOTOOL, the program allows users to perform point-and-click file transfers and 
      registry editing. The L0pht intends to release at least two more plug-ins: BOPEEP and BOSCRIPT. 

      Back Orifice (BO2K), whose name spoofs that of Microsoft Corp.'s (Nasdaq:MSFT) Back Office, 
      originally hit the Internet last year when the Cult of the Dead Cow, a less virginal hacking
      group, announced the program at the hacking confab known as DEF CON. 

      Last month, the Cult of the Dead Cow followed up with an upgraded version known as BO2K,
      which had racked up 128,776 app downloads as of July 22. Once the "server" part of the
      program is installed on a target PC, a user -- or hacker -- can remotely control that PC through
      the Internet using the "client" program. 

      The program runs on Windows 95/98, NT and 2000 and uses encryption to secure client-server
      communications. 

      Internet security firms and Microsoft have called the program malicious and have posted security
      warnings about it.

20.0 MS Wants Free Publicity

      found on slashdot 
      In an obvious ploy to get free publicity Microsoft has
      set up a Windows 2000 machine on the internet and
      invited people to break in. Microsoft wants to create
      the most secure version of Windows ever, which is a
      laudable goal. It is hoped that this is not a primary
      testing method. Not only is attacking a system blind
      over the net probably one the hardest things to do but
      the people who could actually accomplish this task have
      more important things to do other than testing Microsoft
      products for free. Of course a few months from now I'm
      sure we will hear how Windows 2000 stood up to X
      number of 'hack' attempts via the internet and is now
      the most secure version of Windows ever. Phalease.

      Microsoft to Hackers: Crack This!

      In an attempt to burnish its tarnished reputation for network security, Microsoft issued an open
      challenge on Tuesday to the hacking community. But potential testers barely got a chance to
      attempt to break Windows 2000Æs security system, as the test server Microsoft offered crashed
      and stayed down for most of the past 24 hours. 
      
      Microsoft placed a web server running the latest beta of Windows 2000 and Internet Information
      Server (IIS) outside its firewalls, and invited the public to go after target files and user accounts it
      placed there. The companyÆs reason for doing so? "We hope that this kind of open testing will
      allow us to ship our most secure OS yet," said a Microsoft spokesperson. 
      
      The hacking community was and is largely unimpressed, however. In its posted coverage, the
      Hacker News Network called the challenge "an obvious ploy to get free publicity...It is hoped that
      this is not a primary testing method." 
      
      Members of the Linux-enthusiast site Slashdot for the most part concurred, accusing Microsoft of
      using anti-Microsoft sentiment for free auditing. 
      
      Meanwhile, the Linux community created a counter-challenge of its own. Tuesday afternoon,
      LinuxPPC, the developers and distributors of a PowerPC-native version of Linux, challenged
      hackers to crack one of its servers. Unlike Microsoft, which did not offer any kind of incentive or
      award to hackers, LinuxPPC is giving the machine to the first person to break in. 
      
      Whoops! 
      
      If it was meant as a publicity stunt, the Microsoft security challenge may have backfired. As soon
      as the site went online, Microsoft ran into technical difficulties with the test server. Early visitors
      reported problems with the home-page HTML and Javascript, some serious enough to prevent
      them accessing the page at all. Posted status logs indicate that the server had to be rebooted at
      least once because the system log was full, and some services were unavailable at reboot. 
      
      Most significantly, the server was offline for most of Tuesday due to what Microsoft described as
      "router problems". Though intermittently available Wednesday morning, the site was down at press
      time, and appears to have been pulled from DNS servers entirely; ping tests indicated the MS
      router was functional. Some Slashdot contributors reported seeing a notice that the site had been
      withdrawn, but no such notice is currently posted on any publicly accessible MS server. 
      
      A Microsoft spokesperson attributed some of the difficulties to thunderstorms in Seattle on
      Tuesday, but had no comment on the site's status at press time.

      [Hong Kong, CHINA] The Chinese military hopes to develop the capability of
      engaging in warfare over the Internet by training hackers to take the battle online. 
      
      The Liberation Army Daily (LAD), a mouthpiece of China's Peoples Liberation
      Army (PLA), recently called for the development of this capability. The paper said
      that, by recruiting civilian hackers and training "cyber warriors" at Army schools,
      China could be prepared for an Internet war. 
      
      The call was made in response to several hacking incidents in the US and China
      after NATO's bombing of the China's Belgrade Embassy. The Army paper
      reported that a "battle" was fought on the Internet between US and Chinese
      hackers. 
      
      In May, Chinese hackers infiltrated various US government sites including the
      Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of the Interior (DOI), the US
      Embassy in China, and the Naval Communications Command. Nearly a thousand
      US civilian sites were broken into in the two days following the bombing, sources
      said. 
      
      According to the Chinese military paper, US hackers responded by
      "counterattacking" several civilian sites in China. 
      
      More recently, the Chinese government has been accused of waging a cyber war
      against the outlawed Chinese sect, Falun Gong. Webmasters in Canada, the US,
      and the UK have reported that their sites, hosting or linking to the sect's sites, were
      sabotaged or brought down by hackers traced to Chinese domains. 
      
      In addition to this, Beijing has moved its rhetorical campaign against the sect on to
      the Web. The China Internet Information Center and The China Daily have set up
      anti-Falun Gong sites.

      WASHINGTON (August 3, 1999 10:57 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - Internet banking carries more risk than the traditional bricks-and-mortar
      variety, yet 44 percent of the financial institutions in a survey hadn't taken all the steps deemed necessary to limit risks, congressional
      investigators said in a new report. 
      
      The number of banks, thrifts and credit unions offering Internet banking has nearly tripled over the past year, and more than 6 million Americans go
      online to transfer money between accounts, pay bills, check account or investment balances and apply for loans. 
      
      Some lawmakers are concerned about the safety and security of online banking and the possibility that consumers could lose money or have their
      financial privacy breached by hackers. 
      
      "The American banking system has proven capable of providing full security and privacy," said Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., chairman of the House
      Banking subcommittee on monetary policy. "Our challenge is making sure the current rush to technology does not outpace that proven ability." 
      
      The new report by the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, concludes that Internet banking is by nature riskier than
      conventional banking. The GAO's review of banking regulators' examinations of 81 financial institutions found that 35 of them, about 44 percent,
      hadn't taken all the risk-limiting steps regulators have said are needed. 
      
      The report was being released Tuesday at a hearing of Bachus's subcommittee. 
      
      It found, for example, that the boards of directors of some financial institutions had failed to approve strategic plans for Internet banking, and some
      institutions lacked policies and procedures covering online operations. 
      
      The report noted that despite these deficiencies, the review - conducted from April 1998 to May 1999 - didn't turn up any financial losses or
      security breaches in online banking. However, the GAO auditors said, the sample of bank examinations reviewed was too small to support strong
      conclusions about the banking industry. 
      
      Relatively few examinations have been conducted because Internet banking is fairly new and examiners have focused on the banking industry's
      efforts to solve the Year 2000 computer problem, the GAO said. 
      
      In a related development, federal regulators reported Monday that 99 percent of the nation's federally insured banks, thrifts and credit unions have
      successfully completed preparations for the millennial date change. 
      
      Many major U.S. banks now offer Internet banking, supplementing their traditional branch services. In addition, there has been a recent push
      toward virtual, branchless banking, with online brokerage firm ETrade acquiring Telebanc Financial for $1.6 billion and Bank One launching
      WingspanBank.com. 
      
      Yet, even with the explosive growth of electronic commerce and online investing, most consumers are still somewhat hesitant about conducting
      financial transactions on the Internet, and even more so when it comes to managing their finances. 
      
      According to a June report by investment firm Goldman Sachs, only as many as 4 percent of U.S. households currently use online banking products.
      That number is expected to jump to about 20 percent by 2002.

      DOD will crack down on access to Niprnet 
  
      By Bill Murray
      GCN Staff
  
      The Office of the Secretary of Defense soon will issue a directive to eliminate
      unauthorized back-door access to the Non-Classified IP Router Network.
  
      ôItÆs being worked on right now,ö said Air Force Maj. Gen. John H. Campbell, vice
      director of the Defense Information Systems Agency, who spoke at length
      recently about much of the work on DISAÆs plate.
  
      ôUnless you have a waiver with a specific reason,ö Defense Department agencies
      will not be allowed to maintain these unapproved links, Campbell said in a recent
      interview.
  
      ItÆs unofficial.
  
                       DOD officials are cracking down on unofficial connections to improve security, he
      said. ôThe NIPRnet grew up around convenience, not security,ö Campbell said.
  
      With electronic commerce, logistics and other business processes heavily reliant on the Internet, DISA
      officials are using eight official NIPRnet gateways to improve access, Campbell said.
  
      Meanwhile, regarding the Defense Information InfrastructureÆs Common Operating Environment, senior
      DOD brass recently reaffirmed their support for the DISA-run interoperability effort, Campbell said.
  
      The departmentÆs work on developing an enterprisewide systems plan, known as the Global Network
      Information Enterprise initiative, will not eliminate DII COE, he said, echoing comments made recently
      by Marvin Langston, DODÆs deputy chief information officer [GCN, May 10, Page 1].
  
      Campbell said DOD officials are also pleased with the progress of Defense Message System
      installations. More than 210 sites worldwide use it, he said. Organizational use doubled during the past
      two months, while AUTODIN use decreased, Campbell said.
  
      DISAÆs Joint Interoperability Test Command is testing DMS Release 2.1, Campbell said.
  
      ôThe directories and infrastructure are stable and responsive,ö he said. Message exchange, delivery,
      speed of service and other critical performance measures ôappear to be doing well,ö he said.
  
      DISA is planning several pilots later this year in support of medium-grade messaging, a managed
      commercial e-mail service targeted at users who do not need command and control capabilities,
      Campbell said. Medium-grade messaging will use DOD public-key infrastructure software certificates,
      he said.
  
      Campbell also praised the way DOD handled the Melissa virus. He said the departmentÆs systems
      defense team worked with software vendors to ensure software patches were available for DOD users to
      download within six hours of the first reports of the outbreak.
  
      ôBy midnight, both patches worked, and they were posted on a Web site,ö said Campbell, who is
      commander of the departmentÆs Joint Task Force for Computer Network Defense. Campbell said he was
      paged about the first DOD Melissa infections at 6:30 p.m. on March 26.
  
      The departmentÆs Computer Emergency Response Center officials from each service asked
      organizations to post banners on their networks asking users not to open e-mail messages with subject
      headers reading ôimportant message from,ö even if they knew the sender.
  
      CERC has primary, day-to-day interaction with DOD organizations, Campbell said, and it reports to the
      task force, which is primarily concerned with organized attacks on Defense systems.
  
      For example, no such attacks materialized during Operation Allied Force, Campbell said. ôThere was
      quite a bit of hacker activity from Serbia, but by and large it falls into the nuisance category,ö such as
      defacing Web sites, he said.
  
      Network Associates Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., and Symantec Corp. of Cupertino, Calif., the companies
      that produced the patches for Melissa, hold antivirus software licenses with DISA.
  
      Campbell said DISA officials have committed to giving the task force $3.2 million in fiscal 2000.

      GAO finds security lax for federal employees'
      personal info
 
      BY COLLEEN O'HARA (ohara@fcw.com)
 
      Weak access controls are placing sensitive government personnel and
      financial information stored on the National Finance Center's computer
      systems at risk of disclosure or destruction, according to a new General
      Accounting Office report.
 
      The Agriculture Department's NFC operates financial systems such as
      payroll/personnel and accounting systems for the USDA and about 60 other
      federal organizations. The NFC also maintains the records of the multibillion
      dollar Thrift Savings Program, a type of 401(k) program for federal
      employees.
 
      The GAO concluded that problems with NFC's access control "placed
      sensitive personnel information at risk of disclosure, critical financial operations
      at risk of disruption and assets at risk of loss." Logical, system software and
      physical access controls are designed to protect computer databases from
      enabling unauthorized users to access or change the data stored in the
      systems.
 
      The GAO found that NFC had given legitimate users too much access to
      financial and sensitive personal information. For example, GAO found that 86
      users had the ability to read and alter any data stored on tape regardless of
      other security software controls that were in place. NFC said they have taken
      steps to limit this access, according to the report.
 
      In addition, GAO found that users could bypass certain access controls and
      gain unauthorized access to financial and other sensitive data that the NFC
      maintains or cause system failures. For example, the system software that
      controls batch processing allowed any user with the ability to execute a batch
      program also to shut down the system or turn off features such as the security
      software.
 
      In its response to the report, the NFC said it has "already completed
      corrective actions on most of the items and [it has] planned appropriate
      corrective actions on the rest."

      Yesterday Microsoft placed a Windows 2000 machine

      Today the folks at LinuxPPC have issued a similar
      challenge except they are offering the machine itself to
      the person who breaks in while Microsoft has not
      offered any incentive. The Microsoft site was down
      most of the day yesterday and the LinuxPPC site was
      unreachable this morning when we attempted to check
      it. Companies need to realize that these "Hacker

      nothing more than publicity stunts. If you want a valid

      The Hacker Challenge

     By: Qubik (qubik@bikkel.com)

     You have probably read about them and some of you may
     have even participated in one or two. Hacker challenges;
     where your asked to bypass the latest security measure
     implemented into technology which is already, prior to
     testing, dubbed as the latest in computer protection. But
     for what in return? Most challenges offer a reward of some
     sorts, a reward which is more often than not, a five or six
     figure with a dollar sign placed neatly at the beginning. 

     So just what is the deal with these challenges? What
     purpose do they really serve and are they just marketing
     ploys? 

     I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're an
     administrator of a small corporate network. It's not the
     most exciting of jobs, and you don't have time to keep up
     with the latest going ons in the security scene. Your
     network has been attacked a few times before, and you
     start to think about upgrading your security. So where do
     you start? 

     Where else would you start, but the internet? It's the
     worlds largest resource, and every good company dealing
     with network security, is bound to be on the internet
     somewhere. So you use a search engine or two and you
     come across a web site for a new state of the art firewall,
     who's manufacturers claim it resisted every hacker that
     attempted to hack it at a recent hacker convention. Your
     amazed, surely their high price tag is nothing for complete
     security!? 

     Only what if it is all a clever ploy, haven't you got to ask
     yourself just how many people actually tried to hack into
     that particular piece of software? Haven't you got to look
     into the reputation of the manufacturer? Of course you
     do! To be sure, you've got to ask for the cold hard facts,
     not the marketing babble! 

     There are serious flaws in many hacker challenges, not
     the least being that most 'real' hackers only hear about
     them after they've finished. This makes you wonder just
     who took part, and how they found out about it. 

     It's not uncommon for hackers and security analysts to
     earn wages in excess of six figures, and to earn such
     wages, you've got to be either very lucky, or very busy.
     So what's your guarantee that a hacker who actually
     knows what he is doing, actually took the time out to earn
     a, comparatively, small ten thousand? You have no
     guarantee at all, why on earth should he or she bother? 

     Next ask yourself whether real hackers would want to find
     all those bugs in that new technological innovation. Surely
     their only going to end up making their job, of hacking,
     harder by pointing them out? 

     However, A low level source code analysis of a piece of
     software or a close look at hardware by reputable third
     party security analysis company will delay product ship
     times and cost a lot more than setting up a hacker
     challenge. Not to mention that it has nowhere near the
     same marketing punch. Display your product at an
     upcoming convention and let people bang on it for a
     weekend and then claim "Product X survives Hacker
     Challenge." Makes a great press release. 

     It all seems rather corrupt, with companies hiding the
     truth and rubbing their hands at the millions they make. A
     ten thousand dollar reward seems rather pathetic, when
     your earning ten times that kind of money. Surely these
     companies know this, are they in fact attempting to social
     engineer the hackers or maybe worse their customers? 

     But it's not all like that, there are plenty of genuine
     challenges out there. Some have been set up to test
     software and, now more and more, hardware, others
     testing entire networks. For example, recently the Quebec
     government is enlisting the aid of hackers to test its
     networks and to research new ways of protecting those
     networks. 

     So what can we say about hacker challenges? Do they
     really prove how secure a product is? I don't think so, the
     fact that most aren't officially announced to the hacker
     public and that they are often deliberately misinterpret,
     doesn't give a good impression. But then, who should a
     company go to? It's not the easiest of tasks in the world,
     to announce such a challenge. 

     Hack at your own discretion, don't be afraid to take part
     in a hacker challenge, but don't take the word of the
     manufacturer, when they say it's secure, just because a
     few passers by a convention typed a few keys on a
     keyboard. There will always be flaws in hardware and
     software, it's up to us to the true hacker to find and fix
     them, whether we do it for the companies maketing
     campaign, or for personal gratification.

      Developer issues hacker challenge

      A SMALL Sydney company that has developed software designed to
      make Web sites hack-proof, has thrown out a challenge to crack the
      technology. 
    
      Creative Digital Technology (CDT) has developed software which, when
      downloaded, makes a site secure. 
    
      "We are prepared to stand behind that financially by offering a prize to
      universities to see if they can do what our developers haven't been
      able to do," CDT chief operating officer Philip Burton said. 
    
      CDT, which developed the country's first SET (Secure Electronic
      Transaction) enabled products, is launching the SecurePage product at
      Internet World 99 this week. 
    
      "We can protect any Web site," CDT chief executive Bahram Boutorabi
      said. "The first version of the product runs on Microsoft's Internet
      Information Server platform, but we are planning to roll out across all
      platforms." 
    
      Mr Boutorabi, who is also technology officer, said many sites could be
      hacked because they were developed using mostly straight text. 
    
      "We have developed the technology to put something into Active
      Server Pages, HTML, Net Commerce Mark-up Language and XML, which
      represents a signature that someone has made against that page," Mr
      Boutorabi said. 
    
      Any attempt to alter a Web site's content would result in action being
      taken by the system, which is protected by 192-bit, Triple-DES
      encryption. 
    
      "If the contents of that page have been altered for any reason it will
      stop serving that content out and serve it from its own content area,
      where everything is fully encrypted," Mr Boutorabi said. 
    
      "SecurePage enables an administrator to put a disc into the system, run
      the administration and tell it to sign all of the pages with their
      password. 
    
      "To alter the code or text, you have to have administrative access to
      change the content or to stop the system." 
    
      Mr Burton, who is also a senior partner in CDT, said the company began
      working on the technology after attacks on high-profile Web sites. 
    
      "This came about from evidence that significant Web sites were being
      hacked and destroyed. 
    
      "We believed we could deliver a protection device in software form that
      could be downloaded from our Web site by whoever was hosting that
      particular site. 
    
      CDT declined to reveal further details of the technology pending
      approval of a patent on SecurePage. 
    
      If you decide to take up CDT's challenge to crack its software,
      Computers & High Technology wants to know. E-mail us at
      auscomp@ozemail.com.au û but only if you are successful.

      The organizers of CCC Camp continue their preparations
      for this weekend. It is expected that 3000 people will

      secrets of technology and discuss issues that affect us

     Chaos in Berlin
     by Steve Kettmann 
     
     3:00 a.m.  5.Aug.99.PDT
     BERLIN -- This weekend's Chaos Communication Camp outside East Berlin will be more than just a good time, event organizers say. 
     
     The three-day event will be a combination hacker-fest, technology be-in, workshop smorgasbord, celebration of camping and swimming, and
     lock-picking seminar -- with metal locks, for a change. Around 3,000 people are expected to attend, each paying an entrance fee of DM150
     (US$82). 
     
     
                                                   See also: Geekstock: German Hackfest 
     
     
     The event will be the first of its kind in Germany, but it draws on the tradition established with two similar events in the Netherlands. CCC
     organizers have consulted with the people behind Hacking in Progress, the most recent of which was held outside of Amsterdam in scorching
     weather two summers ago. 
     
     "We've worked a lot with the Amsterdam people," said Chaos Computer Club spokesman Andy Muller-Maguhn. "Five of them even moved to Berlin for
     three months to help us get organized, and another 20 are coming for the camp. 
     
     "HIP was a great experience, but the workshop part of the program was a catastrophe. The heat was so bad and they had tents rented from a
     circus. The sound was so bad, you couldn't hear it from 10 feet away." 
     
     Besides hiring a security company with expertise in handling tech events (and decorating them), CCC organizers can also rely on the German flair for
     organization. More than 300 volunteers have already assembled outside East Berlin and laid down three kilometers of fiber optic cable and 14
     kilometers of power cable, among other things. Every aspect of the weekend has been planned diligently. 
     
     The goal is to provide more than a "hacker holiday," as Muller-Maguhn put it. He aims to encourage some deep thinking about technology and where
     it's going -- and not just from the kind of people who are light-years ahead of the rest of us. 
     
     In fact, the first of the 27 workshops is intended to help general-interest participants get a handle on things. It will be called "How to ask for help
     on the Net," and will be led by CCC member Ron Fulda. 
     "We will not be able to benefit from technology if people feel overrun by it, if people feel handled by machines, rather than feeling that they can
     handle them," said Muller-Maguhn. 
     
     "There are a lot of people 35 or 40 who are unemployed because they were replaced in their job by a fucking machine. They just don't understand
     it." 
     
     The nod to the less sophisticated is probably a good idea. As much as people in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany might respect the CCC for some of
     its high-profile exploits -- like hacking into NASA's computer in the mid-'80s -- some worry that they are losing touch with mainstream computer
     users. 
     
     "The Chaos Computer Club has done some very interesting things," said Herbert Thaten, whose Netz-Werk cybercafe in East Berlin does a booming
     business. 
     
     "They stand for finding holes in the computer systems of big companies. But I went to one of their workshops last year, and it was only for
     specialists. No one there could understand what the speaker was talking about." 
     
     The complete list of workshops was due to be posted shortly at the CCC Web site, but another example of the more accessible workshops is
     "Creating Politics of Crypto Software," led by American hacker Lucky Green. More than half the workshops are in English, and all will be freewheeling
     affairs, if organizers have their way. 
     
     "We have a very qualified audience in an informal setting," said another CCC spokesman, Frank Rieger. "If someone is standing up there telling
     bullshit, he will only be doing it about one minute and then someone will correct him." 
     
     It's easy to take Rieger at his word, sitting with him in the CCC offices in East Berlin, near Humboldt University, not far from Bertolt-Brecht-Platz.
     One large white wall is devoid of notable decoration, except for a black-and-white poster of Mahatma Gandhi kneeling and reading -- with an Apple
     logo in one corner. 
     
     High on an adjacent wall, next to a painting of Christ -- so the tone of ironic worship is not lost -- is a liberated faτade from a Geldautomat, a
     German ATM machine. 
     The hacker movement in Germany is so high profile it has established itself almost as a branch of government. And it wrestles openly with the
     question of how to respond to technology. Stefan Wernery, one of the two founding fathers of the CCC, devotes much of his time these days to
     lock-picking on good, old-fashioned metal, α la Artemus Gordon -- just the sort of thing the least tech-conscious person can appreciate. 
     
     "It's sort of lock-picking as sporting event," said Rieger. "They are teaching people how unsecure locks are." 
     
     Even if they may lose touch with the masses at times, CCC members spend a lot of time thinking about how they connect with the general public. 
     
     "We can say it's important to give the normal people -- and also politicians and journalists -- an understanding of how the tools work,"
     Muller-Maguhn said. "In America, more people have email, yes, but technology is driven by big corporations that think about profit and things like
     customer profiling. 
     
     "For us it's important to give all groups an understanding of how computers and networks work. Compared to the US, the European public has very
     critical discussions about technology. Maybe that's one reason why technology is not integrated so rapidly. 
     
     "People are not as careless as in the United States. They ask, 'What if?' They think about 1984 and Big Brother. That's always on our minds, so we
     don't have computers that can be switched to fascist mode," Muller-Maguhn said. 
     
     That might even translate into Europeans, always considered backward when it comes to new technologies, having a little something to show their
     American counterparts. 
     
     "The American hacker community is organized very differently than ours," said Muller-Maguhn. "I find it strange. Some groups are very political.
     Some are very technical. I have the feeling there is a very little in common between them. I don't even think they like each other. 
     
     "In Europe we try to be both. We consult with politicians on censoring and so forth, and of course we are in a way a public institution. We try to
     provide information, freedom, and transparency of technology."

      Hackers... Those who would be gods


      Why do we hack?

      Is it to alter webpages and leave some type of cybergang
      inner-city graffiti? Is it to laugh in the face of over-paid,
      under-qualified sysadmins? Well for myself, and everyone I
      associate with, the answer to both of those would be no.
      So then, why do we do it? To seek knowledge? Perhaps...
      That is definitely an overused and somewhat groundless
      excuse. We seek knowledge and wisdom every waking
      moment. Every breath we inhale leases us another 3
      seconds of learning. Yes breaching a network's security
      does without a doubt involve learning. Yet do we not, on
      occasion, breach systems using exactly the same method
      as we have used previously? So in that case, why do we
      do it? If you have broken one NT box by guessing the
      Administrators password, why would we do it again to a
      different NT machine? Have we not already learned how to
      use an IPC$ share to gain the name of the re-named
      Admin account? We already know how to glean hidden
      shares from the aforementioned null connection. What are
      we learning from repeating the task? Nothing. So why
      then? I suppose the first few times, is in the hope that
      you will run into a new challenge. And sometimes we do,
      but is it often enough to chalk it all up to the great quest
      for knowledge? I personally wonder if that is true. Maybe
      as much as we shudder to admit it, it all comes down to
      two reasons. One is simply because it is there, and
      because we can. The other is slightly more sinister... We
      are voyeurs. We want to know what interesting stuff is on
      the other side. Whether we are corporate voyeurs, or
      peeping toms rifling through some hapless 98 users
      hard-drive. Sir Edmond Hillary once said, when questioned
      as to why he wished to climb Everest, "Simply because it
      is there." Are we really that shallow? Do we do this all
      simply because we can? Is the great quest for knowledge
      nothing more than what we tell ourselves to appease our
      conscience? Yet on the other hand I feel that there must
      be more to it. Maybe we really do have a primal thirst for
      information that isn't readily available to us. Perhaps we
      have a hidden side, that no one ever sees. A side that
      nothing ever senses but our keyboards. A darker vampiric,
      hematophagous side that thirsts for the life giving
      hemoglobin of information. A part of us so powerful it has
      altered our very genetic state. Have we evolved past the
      majority of our peers? Have we become demi-gods of a
      brave new "virtual" world? 

      If you could imagine for a second, that we were to carry
      the same abilities and powers into the real world. What
      would we see? You are having an annoying conversation
      with someone you dislike, in a heartbeat they vanish from
      sight. You could instantly alter every part of your
      appearance, as to be totally unrecognizable, or to appear
      to be someone else entirely. Any company or person you
      wished, with a wave of your hand, they would lose the
      ability to communicate with anyone else in the world. You
      could be a ghost, and ethereally pass through any locked
      door or alarm system. You could grab any piece of
      information you desired from that home or office, and pass
      back through it's locked doors, with out any trace. 

      Would these abilities not elevate us above normal human
      status? Is coding not the act of creation on a God like
      scale? "I wrote a little telnet app yesterday." Would
      translate, "Well you know, it took me a couple of hours,
      but I built this nifty little machine that allows me to
      instantly teleport myself to anywhere in the world." If that
      is the translation for writing a telnet app, what would
      everyone think of the guys that wrote Half life? :) 

      So then back to our lives in this virtual world. Are we
      Gods? No. To us there is only one true God. And that is
      the Internet herself. All of her protocols, and operating
      systems. All of her routers, switches, fiber, and servers.
      Every tiny part of her, that communicate so eloquently
      together, as to create a whole. A whole entire being, that
      we all reside within. This is our God. This is whom we
      choose to worship. So what are we then my Hacker
      brethren? We make up less than 1% of all who reside
      within. Are we priests? No, I would place that label on the
      sysadmins, and helpdesk jockeys who instruct the herd.
      Perhaps we are Demons? Do demons not belong to the
      darkside, to the anti-God? If the Internet is our God, who
      is our Devil? Is it possible to have a positive without a
      negative, a Yin without a Yang? We must have an
      anti-God, yet what? I am not sure I know the answer.
      Could it be all that seek to control her? All that seek to
      bend our God to their gluttonous financial and controlling
      gain? It sounds plausible, and don't we battle against
      these powers? Do we not war against the very idea of
      governments and corporations altering our brave new
      world? If we are warriors of our God, would that not make
      us Angels? 

      Thousands of years from now, our descendants may read
      their bible and understand how we all fought gallantly
      against the forces of darkness to ensure they lived in a
      world free of tyranny and oppression. They would read
      how the few battled fearlessly against the many, how we
      couldn't fathom the far-reaching consequences of our
      actions. They would marvel at how many of us were
      captured and destroyed, with out even knowing why we
      had to fight. 

      So maybe we really don't need to grasp at an ethereal
      "why". It may all be pre-ordained, maybe we are just
      meant to do what we do, and it will all be revealed further
      down the long treacherous road. Then again... 

      It is possible we are all just vitamin E deficient, socially
      inept humans, with a burning desire to wreak havoc, and
      feel power and respect we aren't afforded in our daily
      lives. Perhaps it is none of these things, yet that isn't for
      me to decide. I personally like the idea of throwing down
      my gauntlet, and standing as an avenging angel beside my
      God. Ready to war against all that would seek to harm
      her.

30.0 WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE TODAY?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
     
     by Thejian, Thursday 5th August 1999 on 8:20 pm CET
     Novell has released Digitalme, a software product that is said to allow Internet users
     to control their own online identity and make it easier, and safer, to respond to online
     user surveys. Once information is asked by a Web site, Digitalme steps in and
     provides only the facts about you you want others to know, making you as
     anonymous as you want to be. Full story below.       
     
     http://www2.idg.com.au/cwt1997.nsf/8525601d005a204e85255fdc007c1fce/ddddc180892f6fa24a2567c20021527b?OpenDocument
     

     SYDNEY  - Novell has released software it says allows Internet users to control their own online identity.

     Digitalme is designed to make it easier, and safer, to respond to the user surveys often required to 
     enter a Web site, Novell officials said. Everyone needs to be able to manage their identity on the 
     Internet but in the past you've had to let others do it for you and you had no control over what they
     did with your information,&quot; said Novell's director of technology and education services, Glen Jobson.
     
     Digitalme takes the company's Novell Directory Services (NDS) to the Internet. Users of the Novell's NetWare
     networking operating system are already familiar with the concept of an enterprise-wide directory that securely
     stores information about almost anything. Increasingly, users of Windows NT are becoming aware of directory 
     services through the anticipation being generated by Microsoft around Active Directory. And quite a number of
     NT users have also discovered NDS since it recently went cross-platform. The digitalme push is set to take 
     NDS right onto the public agenda and into the hearts and minds of everyone who has ever had to log in to 
     anything on the Internet. The concept is simple enough. You tell someone you trust, maybe your bank, perhaps
     your ISP, everything that anyone on the Net would ever be likely to ask. When a site asks you to provide that
     information, there's no need to start typing. The digitalme agent steps up to the screen and completes it for 
     you. Furthermore, the data communicated between digitalme and the Web site is encrypted and subject to an audit
     trail.
     
     Digitalme won't fill in any more information than you've told it you're happy to provide. If the site wants more
     information, digitalme will tell you what else is requested and seek your approval before handing out your 
     particulars. You can even instruct digitalme to render an anonymous version of yourself to the Web site.
     
     The digitalme information is stored in an online vault, so users are no longer stumped when they use a foreign PC,
     to visit a favourite site. The first vault is being set up by Novell itself at a new site, www.digitalme.com.
     
     We're putting everything on the site that you need, as an end user or a developer,; Jobson said.
     
     You can get the client there, you can store your details in our vault, and you can download the source code and 
     APIs so that you can build your own digitalme clients.
     
     Why would someone build their own clients?
     
     the whole Internet isn't going to want Novell to be the keeper of their personal data. We expect banks, online 
     shops, finance advisers and Internet service providers, will want to manage their own vaults and encourage you 
     to keep your details with them.
     
     Why would you trust them?
     
     This software only allows them to store your details securely. It doesn't allow them to read what's inside. 
     Only you, the owner, can see what's inside, and only you can authorise the information to be released to third
      parties,; Jobson said.

     NAI Groupshield for Exchange bug causes message loss 

     By Ed Foster 
     InfoWorld Electric 
   
     Posted at 2:31 PM PT, Aug 4, 1999 
     A known but unannounced bug in Network Associates Inc.'s (NAI's) Groupshield for Exchange anti-virus product can cause messages from Exchange
     connectors to disappear. 
   
     Users who have suffered from the bug report losing thousands of mail messages without warning or trace. Messages being scanned for viruses by
     Groupshield as they come through mail connectors are inadvertently dropped before reaching the Exchange server, according to the users. 
   
     After describing the problem to NAI support engineers, users were told it is a known problem, but the company's only recommendation was that they
     disable virus scanning of all external mail connectors including those for the Internet mail, MS Mail, and cc:Mail. 
   
     "When we called NAI, they knew of the problem," reported one frustrated user. "Their recommendation is to exclude any connectors from scanning, such as
     Internet or MS Mail. There is no indication anywhere of any problems in release notes or their [Web] site, even now. Even worse, they knew that the bug
     lost data." 
   
     NAI officials contacted by InfoWorld said they could not confirm the existence of the bug, but are investigating it. They also acknowledged that earlier
     versions of the product -- before Groupshield for Exchange 4.03, released last month -- had a "message-locking feature" which under certain circumstances
     could inadvertently lock virus-free messages and prevent them from reaching the server. Such messages, however, can be recovered by the Groupshield
     administrator, they said, adding that they were unaware of circumstances in which messages would be permanently erased. 
   
     Users insisted, however, that messages are completely erased and that NAI support has confirmed that fact. 
   
     "It's not message locking; it's message disappearing," said another user who has repeatedly reproduced the problem using Groupshield with an MS Mail
     connector for Exchange. "We'd turn off their virus protection and the messages would all flow through. Turn it back on and the messages all vanish. Try it on
     another machine, and the same thing happens."

     TO BUILD A HONEYPOT

     Lance Spitzner 
     Last Modified: 4 August, 1999 
     
     This article is a follow up to the "Know Your Enemy" series.  Many people from the Internet community asked me how I was able to track 
     black-hats in the act of probing for and compromising a system.  This paper discusses just that.  Here I describe how I built, implemented, and
     monitored a honeypot network designed specifically to learn how black-hats work. 
     
     What is a Honeypot? 
     
     For me, a honeypot is a system designed to teach  how black-hats probe for and exploit a system. By learning their tools and methods, you can then better protect
     your network and systems.  I do not use honeypots to capture the bad guy. I want to learn how they work without them knowing they are being watched.  For me, a
     well designed honeypot means the black-hat never knew he was being tracked.  There are a variety of different approaches on how you can do this.  Mine is only
     one of many. 
     
     Before I continue, I would like to post a disclaimer.  No honeypot can catch/capture all the bad guys out there.  There are too many ways to spoof/hide your
     actions.  Instead of going into detail on how this is possible, I highly recommend you check out Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding Network Intrusion
     Detection or Bane software, .  Also, throughout this paper I use the term black-hat.  To me, a black-hat is anyone who is attempting un-authorized access to a
     system.  This could be an 15 year old kid from Seattle, or a 45 year old company employee in accounting.  Throughout this paper our black-hat is referred to as he,
     however we have no idea what the true gender of the black-hat is. 
       
     Where to Begin? 
     
     There are a variety of different approaches to building a honeypot.  Mine was based on simplicity.  Build a standard box that I wanted to learn how the black-hat
     community was compromising.  In this case it was Linux, but you can just as easily use Solaris, NT, or any other operating system.  Don't do anything special to this
     system, build it as you would any other.  Then put the system on the Internet and wait.  Sooner or later someone will find the system and attack it.  The system is
     built to be attacked and compromised, someone will gain root on that system,  that is the goal.  However, while they are gaining root (or Admin), you are tracking
     their every move. 
     
     This approach is different from other concepts.  Network Associates has built a commercial product called CyberCop Sting,  Designed to run on NT, this product
     can emulate variety of different systems at the same time, including Linux, Solaris, Cisco IOS, and NT.  Fred Cohen has developed the deception toolkit, which are
     a variety of tools intended to make it appear to attackers as if a system has a large number of widely known vulnerabilities.  One of my favorites is NFR's
     BackOfficer Friendly, which emulates a Back Orifice server.  All of these have their advantages.  However, my goal was to build a honeypot that mirrored my
     production systems, so I could better understand what vulnerabilities and threats existed for my production network.  Also, the fewer modifications I make to the
     honeypot, the less chance the black-hat will find something "fishy" on the box.  I do not want the black-hat to ever learn that he was on a honeypot. 
     
     The Plan 
       
     My plan was simple.  Build a box I wanted to learn about, put it on the network, and then wait.  However, there were several problems to this.  First, how do I
     track the black-hats moves.?  Second, how do I alert myself when the system is probed or compromised?  Last, how do I stop the black-hat from compromising
     other systems?  The solution to this was simple, put the honeypot on its own network behind a firewall.  This solves a variety of problems. 
       
     
       -  First, most firewalls log all traffic going through it.  This becomes the first layer of tracking the black-hat's moves.  By reviewing the firewall logs, we can begin
          to determine how black-hats probe our honeypot and what they are looking for. 
       -  Second, most firewalls have some alerting capability.  You can build simple alerts whenever someone probes your network.   Since no one should be
          connecting to your honeypot, any packets sent to it are most likely black-hats probing the system.  If there is any traffic coming FROM the honeypot out to
          the Internet, then the honeypot was most likely compromised.  For an example on how set up alerting with Check Point FireWall-1, click here. 
       -  Third, the firewall can control what traffic comes in and what traffic goes out.  In this case, the firewall lets everything from the Internet in, but only limited
          traffic out.  This way the black-hats can find, probe, and exploit our honeypot, but they cannot compromise other systems. 
     
     The goal is to have our honeypot behind a controlled system.  Most firewalls will do, as long as it can both control and log traffic going through it. 
     
     Tracking Their Moves 
       
     Now, the real trick becomes how to track their moves without them knowing it.  First, you do not want to depend on a single source of information.  Something can
     go wrong, things can be erased, etc.  I prefer to track in layers. That way, if something does go wrong, you have additional sources of information.  Also, you can
     compare different sources to paint a better picture. 
     
     Personally, I do not like to log information on the honeypot itself.  There are two reasons for this.  First, the fewer modification you make to the honeypot, the
     better.  The more changes you make, the better the chance a black-hat will discover something is up.  The second reason is you can easily lose the information. 
     Don't forget, sooner or later the black-hat will have root on the honeypot.  Several times I have had data altered, or in one case, the entire hard drive wiped clean. 
     Our goal is to track the enemies moves, but log all the data on a system they cannot access.  As we discussed above, our first layer of tracking is the firewall logs. 
     Besides this, I track the black-hat's moves several other ways. 
     
     A second layer I use is the system logs on the honeypot.  System logs provide valuable data, as they tell us what the kernel and user processes are doing.  However,
     the first thing a black-hat normally does is wipe the system logs and replace syslogd.  So, the challenge becomes logging syslog activity to another server, but without
     the black-hat knowing it.  I do this by first building a dedicated syslog server, normally on a different network separated by the firewall.  Then I recompile syslogd on
     the honeypot to read a different configuration file, such as /var/tmp/.conf.  This way the black-hat does not realize where the real configuration file is. This is simply
     done by changing the entry "/etc/syslog.conf" in the source code to whatever file you want.  We then setup our new configuration file to log both locally and to the
     remote log server (example).  Make sure you maintain a standard copy of the configuration file, /etc/syslog.conf, which points to all local logging.  Even though this
     configuration file is now useless, this will throw off the black-hat from realizing the true destination of our remote logging.  Now, you will capture all system logs up to
     and including when the system is compromised.  This will help tell us how the system was probed and compromised.  It is also very interesting comparing these true
     system logs to the logs a black-hat has "cleaned" on a compromised system.  This is the only time where I make a modification on the honeypot. 
     
     The only problem with using a remote syslog server is it can be detected with a sniffer.  Normally, black-hats either kill or replace syslogd  when they gain root.  If
     so, they can no longer sniff the syslog packets, since there are no longer any packets sent.  However, if the black-hat does not modify nor kill the syslogd dameon,
     then they could sniff the packets sent.  For the truly devious, you could send your syslogd traffic using a different protocol, such as IPX, which are normally not
     sniffed.  Your level of paranoia may vary.  There are also several alternatives you can use to standard syslogd.  CORE-SDI has ssyslog, which implements a
     cryptographic protocol called PEO-1 that allows the remote auditing of system logs. For you NT users, they also have a Windows version, called slogger.  There is
     also syslog-ng, developed by BalaBit Software, which is similiar in use to ssyslog, but uses SHA1 instead. All versions are free and open source. 
     
     My third layer of tracking (the firewall is the first, syslogd hack is the second) is to use a sniffer.  I run a sniffer on the firewall that sniffs any traffic going to or from
     the honeypot.  Since the honeypot is isolated by the firewall, you know all traffic has to go through the firewall.  The advantage of a sniffer is it picks up all
     keystrokes and screen captures, to include STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR.  This way you see exactly what the black-hat is seeing.  Also, all the information is
     stored on the firewall, safely protected from the black-hat (I hope :). A disadvantage is the black-hat can hide his moves with encryption, such as ssh.  However, if
     you are not running any such services on your honeypot, the blackhat may not use them. Also, a sniffer can be spoofed by advanced users, as discussed by the
     paper linked above. 
     
     I've had great success using sniffit, a commonly used black-hat tool used to sniff passwords.  It does this by sniffing the first 300 bytes of every packet.  By
     configuring sniffit to capture the full payload of every packet, you can capture all the keystrokes in most sessions (example).  Another excellent sniffer you may want
     to consider is snort, which has additional IDS capabilities. 
       
     Finally, I run tripwire on the honeypot (there is also a NT version).  Tripwire tells us what binaries have been altered on a compromised system (such as a new
     account added to /etc/passwd or a trojaned binary).  I do this by running tripwire from a floppy, then storing the tripwire database to a floppy.  You do NOT want
     any tripwire information stored locally on the system.  By storing it on removable media, you can guarantee the integrity of the data.  As an added precaution, I
     recommend compiling tripwire as statically linked.  This way you are not using libraries that may be compromised on the honeypot.  For the truly paranoid, boot off a
     floopy (such as tomsrtbt), then run tripwire.  This protects against trojaned kernel modules.  Tripwire is an excellent way to determine if you system has been
     compromised.  Also, it is an excellent forensic tool that helps identify what modifications the black-hat has made. 
     
     You may find these layers as redundant.  But remember, no single layer of information can capture all the traffic.  Also, different sources give you different
     information.  For example, most systems cannot detect stealth scans, however, many firewalls can.  If your firewall logs your honeypot being scanned, but there is
     nothing in the system logs, then you were most likely scanned by a "stealth" scanner, such as nmap.  Also, we are not perfect.  Often while tweaking one service, you
     munge another.  You could accidentally kill system logging or the sniffer.  By having other layers of information, you still can put a picture together of what happened.
     If you develop any of your own methods of tracking, I highly recommend you implement them.  The more layers you have, the better off you are.  If you have any 
     methods you would like to recommend, I would love to hear from.  Additional methods can include hacking the system shell or kernel to log keystrokes, but to be
     dead honest, I haven't developed the skills yet to do that. 
       
     The Sting 
       
      Remember, our goal is to learn about the black-hat, without him ever knowing he was had.  To gain a better understanding of this strategy, I highly recommend you
     watch one of my favorite movies, The Sting.  We want to attract the black-hats, monitor them, let them gain root, and then eventually kick them off the system, all
     without them getting supicious.  To attract black-hats, I like to name my honeypot enticing names, such as ns1.example.com (name server), mail.example.com (mail
     server), or intranet.example.com (internal web server).  These are often primary targets for black-hats.  Once we have enticed them, use the methods discussed
     above to track their actions. 
     
     Once the black-hat gains root, the question becomes, now what?  Normally, I continue to monitor the black-hat for several days, to learn what he is up to. 
     However, you have to be careful, eventually the black-hat will catch on that he is on a honeypot.  If he does, bad things can happen..  What I like to do is once I
     learn everything  I can, I kick the black-hat off, normally by rebooting the box.  I do this with the shutdown command, sending a message to all logged on users (the
     black-hat), stating the system is going down for routine maintenance.  I then take the system off-line, remove the backdoors the black-hat made, and bring the
     system back online.  Or, you can reinstall, building a new system.  I recommend you fix the vulnerability that was used to gain access last time, so you can learn
     about new exploits/vulnerabilities. 
     
     The other issue is limiting the black-hat,  we do not want him launching attacks from our own system.  I do this by using the firewall.  Remember, all traffic to and
     from the honeypot must go through the firewall.  I use a rulebase that allows anything from the Internet to reach our firewall, but only limited traffic outbound
     (basically, the exact opposite of what a firewall is designed to do).  The trick is, allowing enough outbound traffic so a black-hat does not get supicious, but we still
     have to limit their capabilities.  If you block everything outbound, the black-hat will know right away that something is up.  If you allow everything outbound, the
     black-hat can blatantly scan the Internet from your system.  You now become liable for his actions, so we have to find a balance.  Normally the first thing a black-hat
     does following  access is to download their tool set.  If they can't reach the Internet, they are going to cover their tracks and leave your system.  What has worked
     for me is to allow all traffic inbound, and allow FTP, ICMP, and DNS (UDP) outbound.  Normally, this is enough for the black-hat without them getting supiscious
     right away, but denies them utilizing most of their tools outbound.   Your mileage may vary. 
     
     Thats it.  All that is let left is to wait for the black-hat to strike (kind of like fishing).  Ensure you have a good alerting mechanism, so you know as soon as possible
     when your system is being probed or has been compromised.  You want to get as much information as soon as possible.  You do not want the black-hat to catch on
     before you know he is there, bad karma may be coming your way.  Good luck! 
       
     
     Conclusion 
     
     Honeypots are an extremely powerful tool that allows you to learn about the black-hat community.  Correctly implemented, they give you an inside window on how
     the black-hat community works.  There are a variety of different approaches to building and implementing a honeypot, mine is only one of many.  My goal is to build
     a simple system that mirrors the production network. then sit back and wait.  The key to tracking the enemy is layers.  Do  not depend on a single layer of
     information, as it can be altered or lost.  By comparing different layers of information, you can also gain a better understanding of what the black-hat was doing.
     Happy hunting :)

33.0 ADMINS ASLEEP ON WATCH?

     "An Incident Note released by the CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon
     University suggests that crackers are using scripts to automatically probe for different
     vulnerabilities in rapid succession." Hence the term "script kiddie". Seems this
     reporter is figuring out the fact that most servers get "hacked" by utilizing known
     holes. ZDNet.

     Security administrator: Heal thyself
     By David Raikow, Sm@rt Reseller
     August 4, 1999 6:25 AM PT
     URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2308725,00.html
     
     When it comes to security, system administrators like to think of themselves as defenders of the
     home-front, locked in an ongoing battle of wits with a horde of marauding invaders. But a recent
     round of attacks on UNIX servers suggests that, in reality, many administrators are asleep on
     watch. 
     
     In an Incident Note released July 22, the CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon
     University described a wave of "Similar Attacks Using Various RPC [Remote Procedure Call]
     Services." Evidence from targeted servers suggests that crackers are using scripts to automatically
     probe for different vulnerabilities in rapid succession. Any one of these security holes could permit
     the cracker root-level access to the server, completely compromising its security and threatening
     any associated machines. 
     
     While these type of alerts usually address newly discovered vulnerabilities or cracking techniques,
     this report was disturbing precisely because there was nothing new about it. 
     
     Each of the security holes attacked by the scripts is well known and documented. Each has been
     fixed by free patches available from vendors. But because many sysadmins are lax about updating
     their software, the attacks often succeed anyway. Indeed, the type of "shotgun" approach that this
     automated approach suggests is attractive only if crackers suspect that a substantial percentage of
     servers are vulnerable. 
     
     Security often takes a back seat to other priorities, as sysadmins focus on meeting the increasing
     demands placed on network systems, according to a CERT technician. Short term, immediate
     user needs tend to trump potential threats from unknown sources. 
     
     "Security is an ongoing thing, and people don't always recognize the threat," says CERT Technical
     Coordinator Quinn Peyton, "Often good administrators are hampered because they lack the
     appropriate resources." 
     
     Cracks Are Costly
     The costs of a root-level security breach can be devastating, however. According to CERT,
     compromised machines must be disconnected from the network, their drives wiped, and their OS
     software reinstalled from clean media. Any data restored from backups must be carefully
     scrutinized to prevent reintroduction of backdoors or viruses. Any and all sensitive information --
     including passwords -- also has been compromised and must be changed. Finally all associated
     machines must also be scoured for any signs of intrusion. 
     
     CERT does point out one silver lining to this cloud. 
     
     "Once people are compromised, they tend to be much more diligent," notes Peyton. "Nobody
     wants to go through that twice."

     Computer Theft Hurts The WELL
     by Chris Gaither 
     
     12:30 p.m.  3.Aug.99.PDT
     A computer loaded with customer credit card numbers has been swiped from GST Whole Earth Networks' San Francisco office. 
     
     Among those vulnerable to credit card fraud are some longstanding members of The WELL, one of the Internet's first online communities. The WELL
     has no ISP of its own, and many members were grandfathered in to Whole Earth's WeNet service through a series of takeovers. 
     
     No fraudulent use of the cards has been reported. The information was encrypted, according to GST. 
     
     "That's great," Gail Ann Williams, executive director of The WELL, said of the encryption. "That's the ultimate defense we all dream of." 
     
     About 2,700 of The WELL's 7,000 customers use the WeNet ISP, according to Andrew Ross, vice president of marketing for Salon.com, The WELL's
     parent company. GST Telecommunications, WeNet's parent company, would not comment or answer questions about the theft Tuesday, saying
     they were too busy preparing an annual earnings announcement. 
     
     However, on Monday the company issued a release saying that credit card companies were immediately notified of the theft. 
     
     Jennifer Powell, a member of The WELL since 1993, said the bank canceled her husband's credit card as a precautionary measure. She is thankful
     that no fraud has been reported, but she said her husband must now update payment information with every service paid for with that credit card. 
     
     "It's not severe, but it's a pain," she said. 
     
     The WELL provided Internet service until 1996, when it split off its ISP division. Whole Networks then took over the division, and GST
     Telecommunications took over Whole Networks, bringing along some of The WELL's customers for the ride.

     New York Times did an article on every growing number of bugs regarding Microsoft
     Internet Explorer.The main problem comes when IE opens Word, Power Point or

     Software Makers Scramble to Address Security Flaw

     By SARA ROBINSON

         SAN FRANCISCO -- Three giants of the computer industry --
          Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer -- found
     themselves scrambling on Tuesday to address a rash of serious security
     vulnerabilities in software designed to interact with Microsoft's Internet
     Explorer Web browser. 

     The flaws, first made public last week, are
     particularly insidious because they allow
     intruders to plant malicious programs on a
     computer merely by sending an e-mail message
     or by luring a victim to a malicious Web page
     that automatically plants a file on the visitor's
     hard drive. 

     In either case, the victim would receive no
     warning of a potential security violation because
     the flaws enable intruders to bypass the security
     controls of Internet Explorer and pass
     undetected through traps set by antivirus
     software. 

     Tom Noonan, president of Internet Security Systems in Atlanta, said on
     Tuesday that several of his client corporations had expressed concern
     that "now that this information is in the wild, their systems are exposed." 

     "They worry that they are building their network on top of a vulnerable
     system," he said. 

     Unlike the Melissa virus or the Explore.exe worm, programs that exploit
     these newly discovered security bugs do not require that the victim take
     any action; rather, such programs can be activated if a user merely reads
     a malicious piece of e-mail while online. 

     As of this evening, there had been no reports of intruders having
     exploited the flaws, but Microsoft announced that the problems had
     prompted plans for a major change in the security design of its Windows
     operating system and the Internet Explorer browser that it recently
     integrated into Windows. 

     Currently, if Internet Explorer encounters on-line documents created by
     one of the Microsoft Office suite of programs -- Word, Excel or
     Powerpoint -- it assumes that they are "safe" and loads them on the
     user's computer without warning. 

     The problem is that these are very powerful documents capable of
     launching executable code, whether benign or malicious. Microsoft said
     future operating systems would not trust such documents. 

     Andrew Dixon, the Microsoft Office product manager, said the company
     was developing an applet, or small Java program, that would issue a
     warning before opening Office documents. 

     The immediate problem with Office is that Word or Excel documents can
     relay an arbitrary command to a computer through a flawed data-base
     component that shipped with all but the last boxes of Office 97. 

     The Office team worked over the weekend to develop and test a solution
     to this, Dixon said. But by this evening they still did not feel confident
     enough to release a patch for the problem to the 50 million registered
     users of Office 97. When a patch is available, he said, it will be posted
     on the Web at http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/Articles/MDACtyp.htm.

     In addition to the Office flaws, security holes were found last week in
     software shipped with Hewlett-Packard's Pavilion models and Compaq's
     Presarios. Both models were designed to offer customers remote support
     via the Internet, using Microsoft's browser. Both computer makers
     configured the browser to allow powerful little programs to run without
     warning the user. 

     Unfortunately, these applets have the ability to run any other programs. 

     Hewlett-Packard planned to have a patch available soon, said a
     company spokesman, Ray Aldrich. He said the fix would be posted on
     the Web at http://www.hp.com/support/hppavilion.html. 

     "We believe this problem is serious and should be immediately
     addressed," Aldrich said. 

     "We do so much testing but sometimes we miss stuff." 

     Hedy Baker, the public relations manager for Compaq's consumer
     product division, said the company planned to issue an advisory on
     Wednesday to Compaq support centers and expected to send out a
     software update to owners of the affected Presarios by the end of next
     week.

     After NATO strikes on Yugoslavia, when China's embassy was accidentally hit, cyber
     war between American and Chinese hackers started. Chinese military wants to train,
     as they say "professional cyber warriors" to be ready for on-line battle. More on the

     [Hong Kong, CHINA] The Chinese military hopes to develop the capability of engaging in warfare over the Internet by training
     hackers to take the battle online. 

     The Liberation Army Daily (LAD), a mouthpiece of China's Peoples Liberation Army (PLA), recently called for the development
     of this capability. The paper said that, by recruiting civilian hackers and training "cyber warriors" at Army schools, China could be
     prepared for an Internet war. 

     The call was made in response to several hacking incidents in the US and China after NATO's bombing of the China's Belgrade
     Embassy. The Army paper reported that a "battle" was fought on the Internet between US and Chinese hackers. 

     In May, Chinese hackers infiltrated various US government sites including the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of the
     Interior (DOI), the US Embassy in China, and the Naval Communications Command. Nearly a thousand US civilian sites were
     broken into in the two days following the bombing, sources said. 

     According to the Chinese military paper, US hackers responded by "counterattacking" several civilian sites in China. 

     More recently, the Chinese government has been accused of waging a cyber war against the outlawed Chinese sect, Falun Gong.
     Webmasters in Canada, the US, and the UK have reported that their sites, hosting or linking to the sect's sites, were sabotaged or
     brought down by hackers traced to Chinese domains. 

     In addition to this, Beijing has moved its rhetorical campaign against the sect on to the Web. The China Internet Information Center
     and The China Daily have set up anti-Falun Gong sites.

     SecurityPortal has a nice analysis of Microsofts problem with security (below). Their
     conclusion: realize MS isn't going away, but they need to be held accountable for the
     security of their products before they are released as well as after they are in
     production. The open source initiative is mentioned here as a possible way to do that
     keep track of those problems. But then still, the Windows 9x product needs to die.
     CNET has an article on the new MS OS beta-versions, is MS learning their lesson?

     Microsoft's next consumer operating system will meld together bits and pieces of both Windows 98 and Windows 2000, according to those who have seen an early
     version of the release, a hodgepodge that raises questions about the company's overall strategy for its consumer platform. 
     
     Microsoft has changed its strategy for the future of consumer Windows several times in the last few years, reacting to various hardware advances, delays in the
     release of its corporate operating system, and personnel reorganizations within the company. 
     
     Currently, the official stance is this: Microsoft will release Millennium, another version of Windows 98, next year and Neptune, a consumer version of NT, in 2001 at
     the earliest. 
     
     However, the lines are not clear-cut because beta testers now report that Millennium contains elements of Windows NT, the consumerish Windows 98 and
     Windows 2000, a corporate desktop operating system coming at the end of this year. Microsoft recently released a preliminary version of the Millennium code to
     developers and hardware partners. 
     
     Although observers say these kinds of twists and turns are typical on the road to a major software release, some critics wonder if all the changes might actually be
     fueled by competitive challenges, such as the Linux operating system and America Online's popular instant messaging software. 
     
     If anything, Microsoft appears to be busy grafting. The Windows Explorer file manager appears to be comprised almost completely of Windows 2000 code and is
     identified in the operating system as being from Windows 2000, according to Chris Hilbert, Webmaster at BetaNews, a beta testing Web site, while some of the
     help files appear to be based on Windows 98, Second Edition. 
     
     "I think Millennium is just something they threw together to ooh and ahh the audience with this developer release," Hilbert said, adding that he does believe that the
     core of the operating system is based on Windows 98, as Microsoft has said. "I believe the guts, or kernel of the operating system, is still Windows 98 based,
     although a good portion of [Windows] Explorer does show signs of being Windows 2000." 
     
     Originally, last year's Windows 98 was targeted as the last release based on the DOS operating system. Future consumer operating systems were expected to be
     based on Windows 2000, a variant of Windows NT. 
     
     That strategy was then scuttled in favor of continuing the life of Windows 98 through incremental updates. Windows 98 Second Edition, released earlier this summer,
     was one such update. Millennium will be another. Windows 2000 has since been a victim of numerous delays, but is expected in corporate systems by the end of the
     year. 
     
     Microsoft product managers could not replicate any scenarios that would identify the software as anything other than Millennium, a company spokesperson said, but
     conceded that the development team may have lifted code for minor features like dialogue boxes from Windows 2000. 
     
     "There's no reason to invent whole new code--but that doesn't affect the fact that they're based on completely separate kernels," she said, explaining that using
     different code is merely a shortcut for the development team. "It shouldn't be necessary to reinvent the wheel. They can use the efforts of other groups." 
     
     But testers assert that the situation affects far more than an isolated dialogue box or two. Justin Jenkins, Webmaster of BetaLabs calls Millennium "Windows 2000
     skin over Windows 98, as far as I can tell." 
     
     It's still quite early in the development process for Millennium, and Hilbert notes that trial versions of Windows 98 contained references to Windows 95. However,
     developers and hardware partners depend on early releases of operating system software to make long-term product plans, analysts say.

     Security: How big of a chink in Microsoft's armor?

 
     BO2K Information Center
     August 2, 1999 - This past week's news of yet another major security
     vulnerability with Microsoft's products, this time with the ODBC database driver in
     Excel 97, has lead SecurityPortal.com to take a look at the big picture, and
     attempt to understand how big of a security problem Microsoft has.
     This latest security vulnerability is one of the most frightening to date, as it
     allows shell commands to be executed by opening a spreadsheet, without any
     warning whatsoever. The ODBC database driver, installed with Excel 97, supports
     a wide variety of system calls as part of its middleware approach to integrating
     applications. Among these APIs is an ability to invoke shell commands. Because
     this is ODBC, and not a macro, there is no warning imparted to the user. A user
     could download a spreadsheet, only to find that it has deleted files, made
     registry entries, or a number of other malicious acts, completely in stealth.
     Do security problems plague Microsoft because of their size, or are there other reasons? There are plenty of reasons to
     love or hate Microsoft. If you have owned Microsoft stock for the past several years, you probably love them. If you
     have tried to compete with them on any front, you probably hate them. Their penchant for consuming any technology
     or application space is well known, from dominating the word processor market to eating away at Netscape's browser
     share to attempting to co-opt Java. Microsoft has shown no fear of getting into new businesses and has experienced
     mixed results, such as with WebTV, City Sidewalk and several others. No doubt, Microsoft plays the role of the 800
     pound gorilla to perfection, and they are a magnet for publicity, both good and bad. As Microsoft aggressively pursues
     new markets and continued dominance in existing markets, are they adequately protecting the backdoor?
     Microsoft is in the crosshairs of the hackers, that is no doubt. M$, Windoze - these negative nicknames are certainly
     only there to mock Microsoft, and there do not seem to be equivalent negative terms for other companies. There is a
     fair amount of validity to Microsoft's claim that Back Orifice 2000, for example, could have been written for other
     platforms and was mostly written to embarrass Microsoft. However, we believe it is a leap of faith to claim that all of
     Microsoft's security issues are relative the popularity of their products, and other competing products have the same
     problems.
     What are architectural differences between Microsoft operating systems and others? Windows 98 and Windows NT are
     two completely different operating systems, each with its own heritage. Windows 98 can be traced back almost to the
     origins of the company itself, as it is an iteration of MS-DOS. Windows 98 is a personal operating system. Its design
     and capabilities are to act as a single user operating system, with penultimate consideration being given to that one
     person behind the keyboard. The efforts put into Windows over the years have been to simplify the tasks of that one
     person, with considerations for the rest of the world being bolted on: network access, file sharing and of course,
     security. There is no concept of different levels of local system authority, user context versus administrative, file
     system permissions, etc. It is a completely unsophisticated core operating system that over time has been overlaid
     with a terrific set of end user features. These are major issues with the Windows 9x operating system that make it
     wholly unsuited with the security requirements of the connected world.
     Windows NT owes its existence to the fractured relationship Microsoft and IBM had over OS/2 ten years ago. Microsoft
     didn't agree with IBM that Windows did not have a future and sought to build its own "OS/2" to compete in the
     enterprise market. Microsoft wanted it to be a GUI to the core, and although it was influenced by many technologies,
     notably VMS, it was a brand new operating system. Unlike Windows 9x, it was built to be a multi-user operating system
     from the beginning. The concepts of a superuser, user, guest, contexts, inherited privileges are all in there. The Local
     Security Authority of NT authenticates and provides access based upon access control lists that extend to file
     systems, processes and any other objects defined by the system. In essence, it has a lot of the security features of
     Unix; it is simply less mature, with more security bugs yet to be exploited. This immaturity often leads to add-on
     applications not fully taking advantage of the security model and defaulting to additional services being implemented in
     an insecure manner, often by installation with administrator rights. NT is just as susceptible to application borne
     viruses as 9x, including programs like Melissa, although a virus that tries to directly access hardware or specific files
     may be constrained by the user's privileges.
     While there are stark differences in the foundation and architecture of these two operating systems, there are also
     security vulnerabilities common to both platforms, caused by other product groups within Microsoft. The effort to
     create a tight integration of its operating systems with Internet Explorer and Office has not only gotten Microsoft into
     hot water with the Department of Justice over possible antitrust violations, but has created an integrated security
     nightmare. Because of this integration, Windows 98 and NT (to a somewhat lesser degree, it depends upon the
     machine account privileges the user has) are unique among major operating systems in that a malicious hacker can
     create a program on a web site that can be opened and in one step destroy a computer. Tightly integrating
     applications with operating systems is bad for security, probably the worst thing Microsoft has done for security. In
     fact, it could be argued that Windows NT has a fairly good security model, until you start adding Microsoft applications
     on top of it. Some observations:
     The Windows 9X product needs to die, and Microsoft will need to be pushed to make this happen. There have
     been several occasions where the product end of the Windows 9X line has been predicted, even positioned by MS
     executives as a stepping stone to NT. Yet it has outlived even many internal projections within Microsoft, for the
     simple reason being that it is a cash cow. The momentum behind its huge legacy created a product that has by far
     outsold NT with lower development costs. How do you financially justify shutting something like that off? This is
     something that has been argued long and hard internally within Microsoft, to the point that you would probably be
     safer sharing a cab with an NT and Linux developer, than with an NT and Win98 developer. CIOs need to keep in mind
     that much of the future threats to their infrastructure will come from within, and there is no really safe place to use
     Windows 9x. If you need to run Windows, you need to run NT.
     Microsoft needs to make secure computing the cornerstone of the company, and the foundation of every
     product and service offering. For the end user right now, Microsoft practices "Are you sure?" security: "Are you
     sure" you want to run this macro, open that file? In fact users are often uncertain if the file they are about to open is
     going to work as advertise, or is going to wreak havoc on their system. If you look at the Security tab within Internet
     Explorer, you see different "zones" that you can define settings for: Internet, Intranet, Trusted Sites and Restricted
     Sites. Even if users could accurate index the world according to these categories, it is very crude and not very useful.
     Systems need to function under the principle of least privileges, and in a large Intranet for example, there could very
     definitely be one or two servers with malicious trojans.
     Microsoft haters need to know MS is not going away, and need to get over it. Industry giants die hard. Bill Gates
     has liked to tell the story about when he first saw kit microprocessors, he thought IBM was toast. I remember the first
     80386 processors being promoted as a mainframe on a chip and again IBM was predicted to be in deep trouble. What
     people did not realize was that as expensive as the big iron was, the investment in mainframe applications, Cobol code
     and business processes was infinitely greater. The point here is that Microsoft is not going away. Enterprises with a
     heavy investment in Microsoft desktops are not going to upgrade to Linux stations with KDE en masse any time soon.
     Linux, with its heritage as a Unix derivative, and intense scrutiny by a million developers, is a strong competitive threat
     to the same hardware markets that Microsoft sells its own operating systems. While pushing Linux strongly on the
     desktop has not been a topic many CIOs have looked at closely, it is growing strongly and in many cases displacing NT
     in the application and file server market. We at SecurityPortal.com have made it no secret that we predict a rosy
     future for Linux. It is in fact a real long term threat to Windows, but not Microsoft. It is only a matter of time before
     Microsoft releases its own Linux distribution. Microsoft is not going anywhere and needs to be part of the security
     solution.
     Microsoft needs to be held accountable for the security of their products before they are released as well as
     after they are in production. There needs to be some independent review of Microsoft's code for security
     vulnerabilities. We can think of no better way to do this than to join the Open Source initiative and in effect put its
     software in the public domain. This would be a radical departure for Microsoft, but no other single action in the
     industry could do so much to improve security.
     To get back to our original question, Security: How big of a chink in Microsoft's armor? It is a very big problem. The
     years of focus on user friendliness, leveraging operating system dominance against competitive applications and
     internal strife has built an insecure house of cards. We need to put the walls back between our applications and
     operating systems. We need third party auditing and accountability for code, possibly through Open Source initiatives
     within Microsoft. Most of all, we need every CIO to demand that Microsoft reinvent itself around security, just as it
     reinvented itself around the Internet a few years ago.

     "Companies think if they buy an expensive 'firewall', they are secure because the bad
     guys are outside. "In reality, the majority of the threat comes from within." Dealing
     with the fact computer hacking is often an inside job, here are some of the main
     targets of such an attack. Full story below.

     Computer hacking often an inside job 

     By LEONG CHAN TEIK

     THE enemy is within -- that is the harsh reality that many
     companies have yet to grasp, so say two experts on
     computer network security. 

     Mr Jeff Moss, 29, director of professional services at
     Nasdaq-listed Secure Computing Corporation, said
     yesterday: "Companies think if they buy an expensive
     'firewall', they are secure because the bad guys are
     outside. 

     "In reality, the majority of the threat comes from within." 

     He is a former hacker who now breaks into corporate
     networks only when employed by owners who want to
     find out their areas of vulnerability. 

     He told The Straits Times that at a basic level,
     employees can now easily buy software or download
     software from the Internet that allows them to read their
     colleagues' e-mail. 

     "There are many tools to do it for you. You don't need
     to know a lot of technical stuff." 

     Frequently, that is not going to hurt anyone but there will
     be occasions when the companies' systems will be under
     threat. 

     Said Mr Moss, who is conducting a seminar for some
     200 government and private-sector IT staff here today:
     "One guy learnt that he was going to be fired. He had
     the whole day to really damage the network if he wanted
     to." 

     A common weakness of networks is that they do not
     segregate, say, the engineering department from the
     accounting department. 

     This makes for an open system that is vulnerable to
     attack from all corners. 

     Mr Colin Smillie, 26, technical manager of Secure
     Computing, said a favourite target of hackers is other
     users' passwords. 

     And it is an easy target. 

     Once they have succeeded in getting the passwords,
     they can access confidential files or send e-mail. 

     He said a solution lies in a pager-like device made by his
     company which generates passwords for one-time use
     only. 

     The holder keys in his personal identification number into
     the device which will then generate the password he has
     to use the next time he logs onto the network. 

     The network is pre-programmed to accept only that
     password. 

     On the whole, Mr Moss and Mr Smillie said that
     companies should pay attention to designing systems that
     are resistant to an attack from within, which is more
     costly and complex to do. 

     They have to hire more and brighter administrators. 

     The danger is getting bigger by the day, said Mr Moss,
     who organises the yearly Def Con conventions in Las
     Vegas where law enforcement agencies such as the US
     Federal Bureau of Investigation and corporate America
     meet hackers from around the world to discuss security
     issues. 

     "You now have more temporary workers, consultants,
     contractors and business partners who are there for the
     day. The trend of more and more people sharing data
     will continue," he said.

39.0 DRUNKEN HACKERS ON JERRY SPRINGER

     "Drunken hackers: The women who love them and the admins who fear them." Lol,
     yes the Website of the "Jerry Springer" show got hacked yesterday by "Hacking for
     Drunks". The story is on Newsbytes, the mirror on Attrition.org

     Springer Website Hacked! On The Next Jerry Springer! 
     
     By Bob Woods, Newsbytes
     CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, U.S.A., 
     02 Aug 1999, 3:48 PM CST

     The phrase, "Drunken hackers: The women who love them and the admins who fear them," sounds like it would belong on
     the "Jerry Springer" show - or at least its accompanying Website. The phrase was indeed on the site, but no one from the
     show put it there. 

     A three-member group calling itself "Hacking for Drunks" (HFD) apparently cracked the site in recent days, putting up text
     on the site that sounds as if it were stolen from a promotional TV spot for the show. 

     The site is located at http://www.jerryspringer.com 

     "On the next Jerry Springer... Meet beercan, b33rman, and beerb0ttl3," the hacked page began. "Three young men who
     have given there (sic) up their lives to alcohol abuse and computer hacking. They have agreed to come on Jerry to tell there
     story." 

     "These three men... will introduce everyone to their world of liquor, women, and computers," the text at the site went on.
     "You will meet people whos (sic) lives they have changed, and lives they have ruined. They will tell their tale of how they
     were draged (sic) into the computer underground, where the only rules... are there (sic) own." 

     "This amazing story of lost innocence will touch you, and keep you wondering what your children are doing on the
     weekends," the text on the cracked site added. 

     As of 4:00 PM EST, the Springer site had not been restored, Newsbytes notes. 

     Officials from neither the Jerry Springer show nor the company that produces the shockfest, Studios USA, could be
     immediately reached for comment. 

     Hacking for Drunks also claimed responsibility for the recent cracking of "The Blair Witch Project" Website, at
     http://www.blairwitch.com . The Blair Witch Project is a movie that gained a large following even before its release across
     the country, due in large part to Artisan Entertainment's Internet-based marketing of the flick. 

     The message at the Blair Witch site was much simpler: "BOO~!@#$%!... d1d w3 scar3 j00?" 

     The movie - made for $60,000 in the woods of Maryland - racked up $28.5 million this past weekend, in its first weekend of
     release to 800 theaters.

40.0 DATA PROTECTION NOT TO BE IGNORED

     A London-based legal firm has warned that organizations should not ignore their legal
     requirements with regards data protection on the Web. Next to the threat by the EU
     to take legal action against members who don't implement certain data protection
     legislations, the firm, Tarlo Lyons, warns for the legal implications of data protection
     for businesses. Story below

      http://www.technologypost.com/ecommerce/DAILY/19990802105186419.asp?Section=Main


          Published on Monday, August 2, 1999

     E-COMMERCE 

      Data protection on Web
        should not be ignored 

     NEWSBYTES 

     Tarlo Lyons, a London-based legal firm that has been
     intricately involved with many aspects of the British
     government's information technology (IT) operations
     and legislation, has warned that organizations should not
     ignore their legal requirements with regards data
     protection on the Web. 

     The timely warning comes as the European Union (EU)
     has threatened legal action against nine EU member
     countries for failing to implement its new data protection
     legislation. 

     According to the EU press office in Brussels, warning
     letters have now been sent to government ministers in
     France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany,
     Ireland, the UK, Denmark, Spain, and Austria. 

     The legislation, which became law on a pan-European
     basis in October of last year, goes beyond existing
     single country laws in many EU member states in giving
     citizens very broad rights as to how their personal data
     is storied by companies. 

     Back in London, meanwhile, Andrew Rigby, head of
     e-commerce and digital media with Tarlo Lyons, said
     that many businesses operating in the EU may be
     sending personal data overseas - something which
     breaches Principle 8 of the new Data Protection Act
     1998 and the European Union Directive number
     (95/46/EC) on the protection and free movement of
     personal information. 

     Despite the fact that many employees are unaware of
     the legal issues relating to transborder personal data
     transfers, Tarlo Lyons argues that the use of the Internet
     may cause breaches of the law. The legal firm says that,
     because of the use of the Internet as a means of
     advertising and communication, many global businesses
     are quite often using it both to collect personal
     information and to send it to overseas offices. 

     Despite this stark warning, Tarlo Lyons is pragmatic
     enough to say that, in general terms, exporting data is
     fine if the receiving country is in the EU territories.
     Problems, however, can occur in countries outside the
     EU and where there are no similar laws protecting
     consumers sending personal information. 

     The law firm singles out the US for clear criticism in this
     regard, which it says does not have similar laws to those
     seen in the EC. It warns that, in the absence of
     reciprocal data protection laws in the importing country,
     global businesses need to enter into inter- company
     contracts so as to avoid breaching the law. 

     The bottom line to the increasing use of the Internet for
     personal data transmissions, the law firm says, is that
     businesses operating on a global scale cannot afford the
     adverse publicity of being in breach of something as
     fundamental as privacy and confidentiality.

     Wireless data encryption due for handhelds 

     By Ephraim Schwartz

     Posted at 6:25 AM PT, Aug 2, 1999 
     Handheld devices will get a boost in security this week when Puma Technology announces that it will license Certicom's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
     technology for its Intellisync synchronization products. 
   
     Corporate users of messaging, calendaring, and contact databases on both Palm and Windows CE handheld devices now will be able to synchronize over
     any wireless network with so-called strong data encryption. The next version of Intellisync Anywhere, due to ship later this year, will include the Certicom
     security software. 
   
     The ability to prevent the interception of data is a step toward adoption of handheld devices in the enterprise, but more is still needed, according to IT
     consultants and industry analysts. 
   
     "The lack of security never kept handhelds from being officially supported devices," said Travis Hoxmeir, a consultant at Akila, a Portland, Ore., company
     that helped the Pacific Gas and Electric Gas Transmission agency to deploy a handheld strategy. "Within IT, security is an important issue, but users just say,
     'I want [a handheld]. Security is somebody else's problem, not mine,' " Hoxmeir said. 
   
     Though the Certicom technology will guard against midair interception of data, a bigger problem for IT is what data employees are putting on their handhelds,
     according to Ken Dulaney, vice president of mobile computing at the Gartner Group, in San Jose, Calif. 
   
     The storage of company information on personally owned handheld devices is a serious problem, Dulaney said. 
   
     "We need something from Puma, like a console, that tracks what corporate data is flowing out to these devices," Dulaney added.

     Feds say Y2K experience aids in cyberdefense

     BY DIANE FRANK (diane_frank@fcw.com)

     The Senate last week took its first close look at how the expertise and
     systems being developed to deal with the Year 2000 problem can be used now
     and in the future against intentional attacks on the nation's infrastructure.

     Testifying before the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology
     Problem, federal experts said experience gained by a special coordination center
     created to gather and share information on problems caused by the Year 2000
     date change could be used to confront infrastructure protection issues.
     However, the center itself may not be needed beyond next March.

     "Clearly, there will be much of value that will last beyond the [Year 2000
     Information Coordination Center]," said John Koskinen, chairman of the
     President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. "This is in effect our first
     real-time test...and ultimately, it is a great way for all of us to learn from this
     experience."

     President Clinton recently officially created the ICC, which will gather and
     share information on incidents worldwide caused by the Year 2000 date change.
     That information then will be used by agencies, state and local governments and
     the private sector for a coordinated response. The Senate committee is
     considering expanding its mission beyond the Year 2000 problem and its life
     span beyond Feb. 29 to oversee the information security and critical
     infrastructure protection efforts at the congressional level.

     But federal officials involved in infrastructure protection issues told the
     committee that the structures already are in place in the public and private
     sectors to handle critical infrastructure protection. The officials added that the
     ICC's information sharing mechanism and the partnerships created throughout
     government and industry as part of that sharing will be key when dealing with
     any incidents in the future when someone brings down a computer system that
     controls a country's transportation, communication or energy infrastructures.

     "Our collective efforts on Y2K should provide valuable lessons learned for the
     continuing activities of the NIPC and the federal lead agencies in dealing with
     cyber incidents after Y2K," said Michael Vatis, chief of the National
     Infrastructure Protection Center at the FBI.

     It is hoped that the experience gained from fixing the Year 2000 bug will cut
     down on the time it will take to develop future responses and management to
     critical infrastructure attacks, said John Tritak, director of the Critical
     Infrastructure Assurance Office.

     The Defense Department has plenty of experience dealing with cyberprotection
     issues, but it plans to rely heavily on the structures that are being put in place
     within the department to support the ICC, said Richard Schaeffer, director of
     infrastructure and information assurance at the Office of the Assistant
     Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence.

     Experts throughout government and industry have started to refer to the Year
     2000 problem as the first real test of protecting the critical infrastructure of the
     United States against computer system failures. Although any problems caused
     by the Year 2000 date change will be unintentional, focus is turning to the
     possible effect on the nation's infrastructure if someone deliberately attacked a
     system in an attempt to bring it down.

     Committee chairman Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah) and vice chairman Sen.
     Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) also raised several possibilities for more concrete
     ways that agencies and industry can contribute, including continuing the ICC in
     the role of a critical infrastructure protection center, creating a new organization
     to oversee the coordination and even creating a "government chief information
     officer," who would be at the level of an assistant to the president. 

     The key to infrastructure protection is how fast the response time is because the
     longer the response takes, the longer you are vulnerable, said Winn Schwartau,
     information warfare author and consultant. "We need a fundamental shift in the
     way we approach security," Schwartau said. "It requires an empowerment
     much farther down the chain of command."

     Beyond Virtual Vaccinations  

     Developing a digital immune system in bits and bytes
     
     By Damaris Christensen
     
     The fear of new, dangerous viruses sweeping through an unprotected population is not limited to public health officials.
     Computer researchers have long worried because typical virus-scanning computer programsùwhich essentially vaccinate
     machines against known virusesùbecome outdated as newly created viruses spread over the Internet. 
     
     Just as researchers turned to biology in applying the name virus to the pesky programs that could make computers sick,
     several groups have turned to biology for a new model of how to protect computers against unknown viruses. They are focusing
     on the human immune system.
     
     These computer scientists hope to develop a digital system that, like the immune system, can quickly recognize and fight off
     known infections, identify new intruders and learn how to deter them, and remember all previously encountered pathogens.
     Such a system also needs to be safe, reliable, and secure.
     
     A computer virus released in March aptly demonstrated the need for more-effective ways of fighting off computer viruses.
     Although warnings about the Melissa virus went out soon after it was identified, it spread as quickly as the alarms (SN: 5/8/99,
     p. 303). Within just a few days, the virus had circled the globe, sending countless unwanted E-mail messages across the
     Internet and clogging E-mail service at hundreds of organizations, forcing them to shut off their Internet connections.
     
     Although Melissaùthe first virus to mail itself around the worldùmerely clogged E-mail systems, virus makers have already
     launched spin-offs of the virus designed to destroy data.
     
     The risk of computer infections rises as more information is exchanged through E-mail or over the Internet. Likewise, the
     potential damage that viruses can create multiplies as people send sensitive personal and corporate data over the Internet.
     Computer security experts also warn that the avenues for viruses to spread multiply dramatically as computers use software
     that's integrated so that one program can launch another.
     
     "There used to be plenty of time to analyze a virus before it spread, but Internet-borne viruses can spread around the world in
     hours or days," says Steve R. White of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. "In a world
     where things can travel this quickly and do this much damage, we have to have automated ways of dealing with them. It is
     silly to think that we can protect against these viruses manually."
     
     
     
     Computer viruses got their name from what White calls "an obvious but deep biological analogy." Like biological viruses, the computer versions replicate by attaching
     themselves to a host (a computer program rather than a human cell) and then co-opting the host's resources to make copies of themselves. Infection can lead to death:
     The computer crashes and all program information is irretrievably lost. Infection can also lead to sickness when the virus does not destroy any data but spreads and slows
     programs and communications. Even seemingly innocuous viruses may taint files and make the computer more likely to crashùlike a long-lasting, low-grade infection.
     
     Companies spend several hundred million dollars annually on antivirus products and services, and they lose even more in downtime when they need to take their systems
     off-line to prevent viral infections from spreading.
     
     Because antivirus programs can only identify the viruses they already know, they aren't effective against the 10 to 15 new viruses created every day. Worst of all, says
     White, "many users of antivirus software blissfully continue to use antivirus software that is more than a year out of date."
     
     Aside from frequent updates, there are few ways of strengthening this system. Some antivirus programs can monitor a computer system for viruslike behavior, such as
     making a file bigger without adding new data, but such systems are prone to false alarms and virus makers can take steps to evade such detection systems.
     
     In the early 1990s, White and his colleagues at IBM dreamed of a digital immune system for computers (SN: 7/23/94, p. 63). For a model, they looked to the human
     immune system, which is constantly bombarded by infectious agents it has never before encountered and yet to which it generally responds quickly.
     
     Computer virus makers often reuse key parts of existing viruses in their new creations, White explains. An immune system should be able to identify previously
     unrecognized viruses by these short so-called genes, which often are critical to the viruses' function. Although conventional software might contain some of these genelike
     sequences, the presence of many is typically a sign of viral infection, White says.
     
     When a computer participating in a pilot test of this digital immune system finds virus genes or any other signs of infection, it strips out confidential data and encrypts the
     rest. The altered file then goes to a central computer facility at IBM to be analyzed. A computer there routes the virus to a test machine that lures the virus into replicating
     by running a variety of programs. If any of these decoy programs become infected, the test computer attempts to pull out a signature that can identify the virus in other
     computers.
     
     The signature and a prescription to strip the virus out of infected files is then sent back to the central computer. It adds the new virus to its database and sends the
     information on detection and treatment back to the infected computer. IBM's automated process typically takes less than 5 minutes to identify a virus signature and derive
     a prescription, the developers claim.
     
     Uninfected computers will also be "vaccinated," as the IBM team puts it, against infections with this new virus as soon as they check the updated database. Ultimately,
     White envisions, uninfected computers will be vaccinated automatically.
     
     Later this summer, IBM, in conjunction with a leading antivirus-program developer, Symantec Corp. in Cupertino, Calif., plans to release an antivirus plan that includes such
     a digital immune system. "This is the first step toward a comprehensive system that can spread a global cure for a virus faster than the virus itself can spread," White
     says.
     
     The IBM researchers are still trying to develop ways to mimic another trait of the immune system. An infected cell produces chemicals signaling distress, warning neighbor
     cells to put up barriers to slow the spread of the virus. Thus, when the immune system develops ways of attacking the intruder, it can quickly outpace the spread of the
     virus.
     
     
     
     The biological analogies of computer security may stretch even further than IBM's vision, says Stephanie Forrest of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The
     human immune system identifies foreign invaders because they don't carry the body's typical flags of "self," not because they resemble other infectious agents. Forrest and
     her colleagues have found a way for a computer to identify self.
     
     By looking at short sequences of signals between a program and the computer's operating system, she and her colleagues have defined patterns unique to each machine.
     Abnormal patterns may be a sign of infection. For example, a program making unusual demands on system resources has very likely been co-opted by a virus or is being
     attacked by a hacker, says Forrest.
     
     "We've shown pretty convincingly that looking at these short sequences of self gives good discrimination between what is self and what isn't," she says. Such a system
     can be very efficient, Forrest points out. The protected computer uses its resources to check only programs and files that it is using.
     
     She and her colleagues have also shown that information packets flowing into and out of a network of computers hooked to the Internet show patterns recognizable as self
     or nonself.
     
     Like white blood cells in the human body, a digital immune system can create antibodies that recognize foreign material, Forrest says. To minimize the chances that the
     antivirus program will attack the computer itself, it would always destroy antibodies that flag patterns that are intrinsic to the computer. Using the remaining digital
     antibodies, the system will periodically check for abnormal patterns that may signify virus infections or intrusions from hackers.
     
     Forrest and her colleagues are working on a system that will allow a computer to continually learn to redefine itself, so the computer can accept new programs without
     flagging them as viruses. The researchers have not yet explored how to attack viruses once identified.
     
     Forrest says that a self-recognizing system will be practical even for individual computers connected to the Internet and used primarily for E-mail, writing, designing graphic
     presentations, and perhaps a little programming.
     
     Though still theoretical, Forrest's approach may offer many advantages. A different immune system would run on every computer. Since every computer would create
     different antibodies, a virus that evaded one computer might not escape detection by another, limiting the spread of the virus. Likewise, a person who broke into one
     computer network and managed to avoid detection by that system might not be so successful on another network, she says.
     
     "They've taken a much more exact analogy with biology by developing digital antibodies," says White. "But the analogy breaks down. All of my cells come from me, so my
     immune system can define self. But I put files on my computer every day.... This system may be very good for intrusion detection, but it may not be a good approach for
     viruses, because it will make too many mistakes. Our approach is more specific for viruses."
     
     
     
     Both research groups caution that in nature, no defense system remains perfect forever. Just as white blood cells and viruses engage in a delicate dance, each evolving to
     outwit the other, so will computer viruses and antivirus technology, White says.
     
     Viruses are getting more dangerous all the time, he says. Several programs for automating the development of macro viruses are circulating, meaning that the virus-writing
     community can create viruses faster than ever.
     
     There are even some indications that viruses may be evolving on their own, White says. For example, some versions of Microsoft Word may make minor errors when
     copying viruses. These changes may disable the virus, or they may make the virus harder to spot. Also, if two or more viruses successfully infect a computer, one may
     accidentally copy itself into the other virus, creating a new kind of bug, he says. While uncommon so far, these scenarios are certainly threatening, White notes.
     
     Whatever the form of the threat, the goal of protecting computer systems remains. "What we would ideally like is for a computer to behave the way the human body does,"
     says Sushil Jajodia of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "When we are attacked by a virus, we get sick, but the immune system detects the virus, defeats it, and
     heals the damage. Computer systems are not like the human body, though, in that we need to provide the technology."
     
     Because programs and operating systems are not usually designed with security in mind, antiviral programs will always be behind the curve, says Jajodia. "It still isn't clear
     how well this idea [of digital immune systems] will work, but we have no better alternative for detecting virus infections," he says.
     
     Computer users have demanded ease of use but not security, says Forrest. "While people are becoming aware of the issues...they don't feel personally threatened yet."
     She notes that "when the Internet took off in the early '90s, it became evident that the computer-security problem was going to become everybody's problem."
     
     Jajodia, editor-in-chief of the Journal of Computer Security, says that programmers should address the problem of viruses long before people begin using newly developed
     software.
     
     Designing computer systems and programs with security in mind is an important first step, he says. More programs should check digital signatures to confirm that
     transferred files and computer code come from a trusted source. Better encryption systems, which help ensure that information has not been altered in transit from one
     computer to another, would make it harder for people to design viruses and for viruses to spread, he says.
     
     Computer-security experts warn that no single set of changes will be enough to completely protect increasingly interconnected computer systems. They hope, however,
     that new security measures, such as digital immune systems, will fend off future epidemics.
     
     Computer viruses: Then and now 
     
     The first computer virus, called Brain, appeared in 1987. The people who created the first viruses hitched them to operating systems (such as DOS) or to applications (such
     as games or editing programs). Some of these viruses are still circulating. With these viruses, when a user turns on an infected computer or runs an infected program, the
     viral code copies itself into the computer's memoryùand from there into any subsequent applications the user runs. These viruses spread only when a computer user
     shares tainted files and programs with other people.
     
     On the other hand, viruses like Melissa latch onto macros, small programs hidden in word processing software. For example, when an unsuspecting recipient of the
     Melissa virus opened an infected document written in Microsoft Word, the virus activated and hijacked another program known as Microsoft Outlook. This program E-mailed
     copies of the infected document to the first 50 people listed in the program's address directory. The virus spread so quickly because so many people use both Word and
     Outlook.
     
     Until macros became commonplace, viruses couldn't infect data files, including word processing documents and spreadsheets. Macro viruses proliferate rapidly because
     many people share data files freely, and they do so primarily through E-mail. Once one data file is infected, a virus can infect all other data files of that application as soon
     as they are opened.
     
     By the end of 1998, programmers and users had identified more than 30,000 viruses. Viruses of all sorts now affect millions of computers every year.

     Forgot a Password? Try 'Way2Many'


     Better Online Security Has Meant More Passwords, and
     More Frustrated Users 

     By JENNIFER 8. LEE

          few months ago, Kevin McGuire, a computer consultant in
          Lombard, Ill., designed a new computer system for a client. After
     a break from the project, he sat down at the computer to start up the
     system but couldn't get into the server. He had forgotten his password. 

     A sense of panic
     gripped him as he
     rapidly typed in
     variations on his
     favorite passwords.
     Two days later he
     gave up and rebuilt
     the system from
     scratch. 

     Not everything can
     be recreated,
     though. Also lost in
     password purgatory
     is a year's worth of personal journal entries he kept in a Microsoft Word
     document on his personal computer. 

     "I wanted the password to be different so that people wouldn't be able to
     get to my journal," McGuire said. "Unfortunately, neither can I." 

     It is understandable that McGuire would drop a password or two. On a
     regular basis, he must remember three dozen passwords to gain access
     to computer networks, software programs, e-mail, voice mail, fax mail,
     Web sites, ATM's and even the security system for his house. 

     Forgotten passwords are an inevitable consequence of the digitization of
     everything from money to mail. Twenty years ago, people had to
     remember only their Social Security number and maybe a phone number
     or two. But since the introduction of the automated teller machine, people
     have accumulated an arsenal of passwords, access codes and personal
     identification numbers to use everything from answering machines to
     office bathrooms. A result is lost computer files, inaccessible accounts
     and a lot of banged-up keyboards. 

     "What is nightmarish is that we rely so much on information that comes
     from different sources," said Alessandro Piol, a managing director of
     Investco Private Capital in New York, who has been locked out of his
     e-mail account while conducting coast-to-coast venture capital
     negotiations. "If you are locked out of a system, it's like losing a limb." 

     The exponential growth of Web sites creates an exponential growth in
     forgotten passwords. Almost all password-protected sites either
     encourage people who have forgotten their passwords to reregister or
     provide a mechanism where they can automatically retrieve their
     password. The New York Times on the Web site estimates that more
     than 1,000 people forget their password to the site each week, and 10 to
     15 percent of its registrants are duplicates. 

     Of course, many computer users simply do what computer security
     experts warn them not to: use the same password for everything. But
     even that strategy is becoming more difficult because various computer
     systems have different requirements for the rendering and length of the
     passwords. 

     Ron Dilley is an extreme example of the password problem. Dilley, a
     network administrator for Applied Digital Access in the San Diego area,
     maintains 129 active passwords, 37 personal ones and 92 for work. 

     He sees himself as the archetypal wired citizen of the future. 

     "I suspect that we will be totally inundated with passwords of one form
     or another in the next 10 to 20 years and possessing 129 passwords will
     be the norm," he said. Dilley began to use a Palm organizer to track his
     passwords. Every few weeks, he forgets to take his Palm when he leaves
     home and makes a 50-minute round-trip back home to pick it up. 

     Forgotten passwords cost millions of dollars annually in help-desk costs
     and lost productivity -- incidents like McGuire's rebuilding of the
     computer system from scratch. Industry estimates say 20 percent to 50
     percent of all calls to company help desks are from people needing their
     passwords reset. According to the Gartner Group, an organization with
     2,500 desktop computers can spend more than $850,000 a year
     resetting passwords. 

     The requests for password help "are considered to be noise and nuisance
     by help-desk staff, because they are so highly repetitive," said John
     Jacobs, president of Network Support Technologies, a company in
     Burlington, Mass. that provides help-desk services. 

                                Forgotten passwords are a product
                                of the computer's ability to store
                                more information than the human
                                brain can. 

                                "In the old days you just had to yell
                                out, 'Zog, it's me,' and he would let
                                you into the cave without clubbing
                                you," said Prof. Irving Biederman, a
                                cognitive neuroscientist at the
                                University of Southern California.
                                "Now you need all these passwords
                                to get access anywhere." 

                                Research confirms the intuitive: the
                                more we are asked to remember, the
                                more likely we are to forget. The
                                brain's capacity for remembering is
                                indefinite as long it has associations
     for the memories. 

     "The design of human memory and the design of computer architecture is
     at a crossroads," said Steve Pinker, a cognitive neuroscientist at the
     Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "A computer password must be
     arbitrary enough that people can't guess it, but human memory is
     designed to remember things that are not arbitrary." 

     Whereas short-term memory usually holds between five and nine items,
     scientists say there are no limits on long-term memory capacity -- as long
     as people have associations for those memories. 

     That is why people have a natural impulse to choose passwords based
     on familiar things -- children's birthdays, spouse's name, favorite sports
     team -- rather than incomprehensible strings like 3B#$Ir or 7*$3fg.
     According to Dr. Pinker, there is no neurological reason that given strong
     enough associations, people shouldn't be able to recall 129 passwords,
     "like you can remember an indefinite number of names of friends." 

     A nuisance for computer users is also a growing expense for companies. 

     The rampant growth of passwords has spawned
     various strategies for handling scattered bits of
     information. Some people keep lists of
     passwords taped to walls or to the underside of
     their keyboards, much to network
     administrators' dismay. Others keep lists in small
     notebooks or in files stored on their computers. 

     Some high-security institutions like financial companies and hospitals
     assign passwords instead of letting users choose, or force users to
     change their passwords every 30 or 60 days, which results in periodic
     spikes in reset calls to technical support staffs. 

     Resetting of passwords has become so costly to companies that some
     are choosing to automate the process. Password reset software
     eliminates the need for harried users to depend on help desks by allowing
     them to maintain their own user profiles. Merrill Lynch and Boeing both
     recently purchased such systems from the Courion Corporation. 

     Michael J. Koszenski, a computer technician in Lexington, spent 2,000
     hours of his own time creating a password database software for his PC
     after being disappointed with various password tracking programs. "It
     basically goes back to if you want something done right, you have to do it
     yourself," said Koszenski, who has 30 or so passwords and access
     codes to manage. For protecting his password program, there is yet
     another password that he keeps in his head. 

     The proliferation of passwords and the propensity to lose them has
     helped fuel a cottage industry of companies and consultants who recover
     passwords using computer programs. 

     While most password recovery requests come from people who are
     trying to retrieve passwords of dead relatives or disgruntled former
     employees, recovery businesses estimate that between 15 percent and
     25 percent of requests come from people who have forgotten their own
     passwords on documents. Tax time is a popular time for people to forget
     passwords, particularly those on old financial files. So, too, are the
     holidays. 

     "For about a week after New Year's people call up saying, 'I got drunk
     over the holidays, I changed my password on a whim and I can't
     remember it,"' said Amber Schroader, general manager of Access Data
     in Provo, Utah which sells about 600 password recovery software
     packages a month. 

     Among the most common requests involve passwords for documents
     created with Microsoft Word or Excel, which are easy for the companies
     to recover because those programs do not have strong encryption. The
     majority of popular software applications produced in the United States
     and distributed internationally have intentionally weak encryption since
     this country has strict controls on the export of encryption tools and
     products, said Bob Weiss, president of Password Crackers, a
     Web-based password recovery consulting firm. "People are surprised by
     how many software products listed on our site are not secure," he said. 

     There are some emerging high-tech solutions to the password deluge.
     Biometric devices that recognize fingerprints, faces and voices, and smart
     cards that are embedded with computer chips are gaining in popularity.
     Matchbox-size fingerprint recognition devices for the PC are now
     available for as low as $99. So-called smart cards, which carry digital
     signatures and are used for phone calls and purchases, are growing at a
     rate of 30 percent a year, predominantly in Europe. 

     Piol, the venture capitalist, once taped a piece of paper listing his
     passwords on the wall by his desk, but a few months ago he started using
     a fingerprint scanner, U.are.U, to help manage the passwords. Impressed
     by the device, Piol tore down the paper and led a $9 million dollar
     venture capital investment in the company, Digital Persona. 

     But until fingerprint scanners and smart card readers become as standard
     on desktops as computer mice, people will still have to struggle with the
     chore of password management. The University of Michigan is teaching
     its students a hygienic, low-tech approach to the problem. Treat
     passwords like underwear, the university says: Never let friends borrow
     them and never leave them lying about. And as anybody's mother would
     say, change them often.

     A Former Network Administrator Faces Felony Charges in Hacker-Site Case
     
     By FLORENCE OLSEN
     
     A 25-year-old former computer-network administrator for the University of Oklahoma
     faces criminal charges under the state's Computer Crimes Act after allegedly
     using the university network to operate a site for hackers. 
     
     which heavy use mysteriously disabled the campus network just as upperclassmen were
     arriving for the fall term. Authorities are investigating whether others were
     involved. 
     
     The heavy usage had the effect of reducing the capacity of the campus backbone from 
     "a 12-inch-diameter pipe to one no bigger than a stir straw," says Lieut.
     Jeffrey Harp, a public-safety officer at the university. 
     
     At the time, university officials seized more than a half-dozen unauthorized Internet
     servers operating in two rooms assigned to residence-hall advisers in Walker Center,
     a 12-story dormitory on the university's campus, in Norman. The Daily Oklahoman reported 
     that Mr. Breding is suspected of operating a "warez" site (pronounced "wares"), where 
     members of the Internet underground copied and exchanged pirated commercial software after
     hackers had cracked the files' copyright-protection codes. 
     
     Campus police say they seized one computer that the former network administrator allegedly
     had set up for a commercial purpose -- serving as host for others' Web pages. 
     
     If convicted, Mr. Breding could be punished with up to a 10-year prison sentence and a fine
     of as much as $100,000. A hearing is set for August 17. 
     
     University police spent 11 months and $20,000 on equipment, training, and consulting services
     to investigate the incident before turning the case over to the district attorney's office.
     "It was an eye-opening case for us," Mr. Harp says.  
     
     "It taught us that we needed to get up to speed on investigating computer crime," he says, and
     in turn led department detectives to seek further training and certification as forensic computer
     investigators. "It was our first case like this, and we're trying to prepare ourselves for the 
     next one." 
     
     Mr. Breding was charged under the state's Computer Crimes Act, passed in 1984 and updated several
     times since. The act makes it a felony to knowingly or willfully exceed one's authorized use of 
     computer-network resources or to disrupt those services to others. Tera Duke, the assistant district
     attorney, says it is the first such case filed under that statute in Cleveland County District Court,
     in Norman. 
     
     Ms. Duke says she is unaware of any pending federal charges related to the case.

     Mitnick's Life - As It Stands Now 
     Monday, August 2, 1999 at 1:20:04
     by Kimberly Tracey - Writing For AntiOnline 

     For a few years I was talking to Kevin almost every day and sometimes
     several times a day. Right now my work prevents me from being in
     touch with him every day, but I know people who are in contact with
     him, so I stay current.

     Here's a little bit about Kevin's life at MDC:

     At MDC there is no yard for exercising. They have no place to exercise
     outside where they can sit in the sun. Whenever the guards call a
     "lockup," the inmates are rounded-up and taken to a very large balcony
     outside. If you want to use a bathroom, you go to the one in your cell.
     When Kevin was sleeping on the floor, he had to use the toilets of other
     inmates.

     There are two TV's on Kevin's floor. The last time I heard, one TV was
     controlled by the blacks, and the other was controlled by the Hispanics.
     These two groups decide what everyone will watch. A white Jewish
     guy like Kevin doesn't have much of a say in the programming. There
     are vending machines on the floors, and there is at least one microwave
     oven. When the food is lousy, which is most of the time, inmates buy
     food from the guards or from someone in the kitchen and prepare meals
     and share them with each other. That is why Kevin accumulated cans
     of tuna and Pepsi a couple of years ago because these items are very
     important when you have nothing else to eat. And the tuna is that brown
     low-grade smelly stuff that I hate....no white albacore tuna at MDC!

     MDC brought in a couple of exercise bikes and they were broken
     almost immediately. I'm not sure what Kevin uses to exercise now.
     They may have gotten some new equipment. When he said he just
     finished a "workout," that could have been pushups, situps, and lifting
     some weights, if they have them. They might consider weights potential
     weapons, I don't know.

     Whenever any of us send Kevin money, it is put into his account and he
     is given a receipt telling him the amount. And unless they have changed
     the system, he doesn't know who sent him the money. And if you send
     him a personal check or a money order from the bank, the money is held
     up for weeks before it is placed into his account. If you send him a
     money order which you can buy from the Post Office, that money is
     placed into his account immediately. Therefore, if you are near the Post
     Office and want to help Kevin, pickup a Postal Money Order and send it
     to him with a note telling him that you included a MO for $10 or
     whatever the amount was. Then regardless of whether MDC informs
     him where the money came from, he will know directly from you what
     was sent, and he will appreciate it very much.

     Whatever money Kevin receives is spent on stamps, envelopes, paper,
     shaving and bath items like soap and toothpaste, vitamins, tennis shoes,
     plain white Hanes t-shirts, etc.

     When Kevin makes calls, he goes to one of the three phones on the
     floor and leans against the wall as he places his collect calls. He is only
     allowed to call collect, and Pac Bell charges around $2.00 for every call
     accepted by the party he is calling plus the minute rate. Each call is
     limited to 20 minutes. The computerized operator breaks in at 19 minutes
     and tells you that there is one minute remaining, and then 15 seconds
     and you are cut off exactly at the 20 min point. If Kevin is lucky, he
     finds a stool he can sit on while he is talking. Usually, each morning
     inmates signup for phone time. If you have a few extra dollars, you are
     able to buy someone's phone time. MDC doesn't like this practice, but
     they all do it and most of the time the guards leave you alone. On this
     floor where Kevin resides, phones are shut off at 9:45 p.m. They are
     turned back on around 7 or 8 a.m.

     During the day inmates roam around in one big "general area." Many
     play cards. There is at least one ping-pong table because you can hear
     the ball being hit back and forth in the background. Inmates can signup
     for library time. Kevin is still being allowed to work on his computer
     during the day, no weekends.

     Kevin and others can buy cheap Sony Walkmans from the prison
     commissary. They can play the radios, but they are not allowed CD or
     tape players. Kevin's attorney, Donald Randolph, can bring these items
     to the "attorney room" and Kevin can listen to tapes and view a video if
     he is with his attorney. So don't send Kevin tapes or CD's unless you
     send them directly to his attorney. And then they may never reach
     Kevin because he is working on his case when his defense team visits
     him.

     Pretty grim, right? Your letters, cards, jokes, magazines, and different
     items you send Kevin break the monotonous schedule he faces every
     day. He may not have the time to write back to every person who
     writes to him, but he reads everything and tells his friends and family
     how much the news from the outside world means to him. And Kerry
     and Emmanuel and the rest of the people who hear from Kevin will tell
     you that he appreciates the support from this mailing list and those who
     visit his site and inform the world about him and his case.

     BTW: 

     Kevin's BirthDay is August 6th. If you would like to send him a card or
     gift, you can mail it to:

49.0 Cybercrime up 43%

     Study: Cybercrime cases up 43 percent
     By Kevin Poulsen, ZDNN
     August 5, 1999 3:54 PM PT

     Federal law enforcement agencies referred a record number of computer crime cases for
     prosecution last year, but most of them were rejected by government attorneys, according to a legal
     journal report released Wednesday. 
     
     The report, authored by attorney and electronic privacy advocate David Banisar, and based on data
     obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Transactional Records Access
     Clearinghouse, appears in this week's Criminal Justice Weekly. It's believed to be the first
     independent analysis of the government's war on computer crime. 
     
     In all, investigators from the FBI and other agencies offered 419 computer crime cases to federal
     prosecutors in 1998, up 43 percent from 1997, and more than three times as many as in 1992. At the
     same time, prosecutors filed charges in only 83 cases.
     
     That ratio of referrals to prosecutions, approximately 5 to 1, is significantly lower than the overall
     rate for federal prosecutions in all categories. In 1998, Banisar said, there were 132,772 referrals at
     the federal level, and 82,071 prosecutions, or about one prosecution for every 1.6 referrals. 
     
     FBI: Hard to prove
     "Computer crime is terribly hard to prove," says FBI spokesperson Debbie Weierman. "Every one is
     handled on a case by case basis, and I can't give you a general reason for the difference in figures." 
     
     According to the report, each year between 1992 and 1998, the Department of
     Justice has declined to prosecute between 64 percent and 78 percent of the
     cases brought to them. Forty percent of the rejected cases cited lack of
     evidence of criminal intent, weak or insufficient admissible evidence, or no
     evident federal offense. Another 15 percent were referred to state authorities
     for prosecution. The remaining cases may be outstanding, or reclassified under
     another category. 
     
     A former assistant United States attorney said he is not surprised by the
     results, and that in many ways computer crime cases are unique. 
     
     "There are serious evidentiary questions and jurisdictional questions in these
     cases," says Mark Rasch, a former computer crime prosecutor, now working as a computer security
     consultant for Global Integrity, based in Virginia. "Law enforcement may be presenting you with a
     perfectly good case, against a defendant in Kuala Lumpur." 
     
     Moreover, he said, "Juveniles are frequently the ones that get caught. So while the FBI may be able
     to put together a perfectly cohesive case against a juvenile, that's the kind of case that may be
     declined by the United States Attorney's office by their discretion." 
     
     Unique challenges
     Justice officials hadn't reviewed the statistics, but agreed that there are unique challenges to
     prosecuting computer crime. 
     
     In 1998, the average sentence for those convicted was five months, with over half of the defendants
     receiving no jail time. Since 1992, 196 people have been convicted and 84 imprisoned in cases
     classified as federal computer crimes. 
     
     Only 57 cases reached disposition last year, 47 ending in convictions, primarily in plea agreements,
     and 10 ending with the status of "not successful" -- a category that includes dismissals and not-guilty
     verdicts. 
     
     Of the cases that ended in 1998, the FBI initiated the most, with 21 convictions, and eight
     unsuccessful prosecutions. The Secret Service, Treasury Department and IRS claim the remaining
     28 convictions and two failed prosecutions, says Banisar, a columnist for the legal journal, and
     co-author of The Electronic Privacy Papers. 
     
     Because referrals can take years to become prosecutions, direct correlation from year to year is a
     tricky matter, Banisar cautioned. But he said the overall statistics are telling. 
     
     "For an issue that the federal government is making such a major deal out of, trying to stop computer
     crime and information warfare, there's remarkably few prosecutions," he said.

      An intelligence brief prepared by the RCMP says that the
      Canadian police lack the necessary skills and personnel
      to protect the nations infrastructure from infocriminals
      and cyber terrorists.

     Police can't handle cyber threats:
     RCMP report

     Mounties say Canada is 'lagging behind' in
     creation of hacker-defence systems

     Jim Bronskill
     The Ottawa Citizen

     The RCMP say Canadian police lack the necessary skills and personnel to
     meet the growing threat to national security from computer hackers. 

     Canada is "lagging behind" other advanced countries in building defences to
     protect communication, power, water and banking systems, warns an
     intelligence brief prepared by the force in mid-June. 

     "There is a general lack of awareness about the nature and level of threat
     posed to national security by cyber attacks and the level of defence and
     response that would be required," says the brief, obtained under the Access to
     Information Act. 

     "Several government departments dealing with an increasing number of
     sophisticated attacks are seeking guidance, support and assistance from law
     enforcement, only to find there is a lack of skilled and trained resources." 

     The assessment is the latest in a string of warnings sounded by Canadian
     security agencies about the vulnerability of the country's information networks.

     A special Senate committee and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service
     have also underscored the threat to digital networks and data banks from
     hackers, electronic spies and cyber-terrorists. 

     The RCMP noted an increase during the last year in the number of computer
     breakins, data thefts and system disruptions, a trend that does not bode well. 

     "The likelihood of a serious, deliberate and targeted attack to a Canadian
     critical-infrastructure system has increased from low to medium, and the
     impact of such an attack remains high," says the RCMP brief. "In the last five
     years, the capability to intrude into systems has increased dramatically as the
     cost of technology has plummeted." 

     On the Internet, there are Web sites, electronic bulletin board services and
     chat rooms dedicated to discussing and trading hacking tools and methods. 

     A group known as H4G1S claimed responsibility for breaking into and altering
     13 major U.S. and Canadian corporate Web sites in April, notes the RCMP
     document. A more serious attack could have the cascading effect of the
     January 1998 ice storm that denied electrical power to parts of Eastern
     Canada. 

     The brief's worrisome tone does not surprise Andrew Mackie, director of
     Manitoba's fledgling information protection centre. 

     "We are way behind the other countries," he insisted. 

     Mr. Mackie said the United States, Australia, Britain and other European
     countries have moved more quickly than Canada to set up national centres to
     detect and prevent attacks. 

     "We don't even have a plan right now. We're just working on it." 

     RCMP Sgt. Andre Guertin said the force sees a rising threat to Canadian
     systems in the immediate future because of the heightened potential for
     sabotage due to the millennium computer bug. 

     The force has established Project Solstice to ensure governments and
     businesses are aware that terrorists could take advantage of the computer
     glitch. 

     For instance, a company might be tempted to waive security screening in the
     rush to hire a repair crew to make systems Y2K compliant. 

     The RCMP have been assisting the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation on
     computer-crime cases, but the memo notes "difficulties encountered with
     Canadian collaboration and investigative support" in international probes,
     raising issues of co-ordination, resources and sovereignty. 

     Mr. Guertin said some of these questions were broached when U.S. and
     Canadian officials met in Charlottetown in June to discuss cross-border crime.

     ROME, N.Y. (August 3, 1999 12:00 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - New York State Police are turning to the Internet in an attempt to track
     down thieves and vandals who trashed the Woodstock '99 site. But their use of news photos without permission has raised other legal issues. 
     
     The State Police posted 14 photographs on its Web site, including 10 shot by Associated Press photographers. The AP protested as soon as it
     learned of the unauthorized use. 
     
     The photos show concertgoers breaking into pay phones, tearing down a 3-mile-long "Peace Wall," looting a vendor's truck and robbing an
     automated teller machine. The police ask the public for any additional photos and details of the identities of people shown. 
     
     Sam Boyle, chief of the AP's New York City Bureau, discussed the site with various officials on Monday. 
     
     "We have two concerns - violation of copyright and the journalistic separation from law enforcement," Boyle said. 
     
     The AP photos were put on the state police Web page on Friday, according to M.J. Edelman, Web master for the state police. Monday morning, Lt.
     Jamie Mills of the public information office said the pictures would be taken off the site. 
     
     Boyle then received calls from higher officials asking for permission to keep the pictures up, which he said could not be granted. 
     
     Glenn Valle, chief counsel for the state police, said his review indicated that there may not be an issue of copyright infringement. 
     
     "We don't think that we're violating the copyright or infringing on the copyright in this manner," Valle said. "It was material that was already
     published."

     It's Internet World meets the Rainbow Gathering next week when geeks from around the world gather for a three-day camp out near Berlin. 
     
     Sponsored by German hacker group Chaos Computer Club (CCC), the event pits campers against each other in periodic hacking contests and gives
     proto-geeks a chance to see the light of day. 
     
     Pre-registration is already closed for the event, which will take place 6 to 8 August in Altlandsberg, near Berlin. However, according to the CCC site,
     those who want to show up at the event with DM150 (US$82) may slip under the 2,000-people limit. 
     
     The camp will be divided into theme villages, Burning Man style. Participants can choose the village that most represents their talents and interests,
     from lock-picking to re-engineering to cryptography. Intermittent events like the Linux Deathmatch, a competition in which one team tries to hack
     another's network, will liven up bouts of partying, workshopping, and drinking at the CCC Leisure Lounge, and swimming on the nearby lake. 
     
     The CCC will provide electricity and an Ethernet for every tent. Campers are encouraged to bring their own computer equipment and can hook up to
     the specially created CAMPnet network or the Internet in their tents or in the CCC hackcenter. 
     
     The grassroots event discourages press and commercial attendance. Business visitors -- defined in the FAQ as those who are "rich or working for a
     company or government that wants you at the Camp because there is a lot to learn or you have a certain commercial interest" -- are asked to pay
     an increased ticket price of DM1,500 (US$800).

     BERLIN -- It takes countless hours cooped up indoors in front of a computer screen to truly appreciate the giddy mood at this weekend's three-day
     Chaos Communication Camp. 
     
     By Friday evening, more than 1,400 hackers, encryptologists, computer visionaries, and assorted geeks had pitched their tents in a scenic lakeside
     field, and more were on their way. 
     
     
     
     An afternoon of workshops gave way to a warm evening of lounging in front of tents, as people pounded away at keyboards and greeted
     acquaintances they had met only via networks or email. 
     
     "It's a way to attach faces to email addresses," said John Gilmore, one of the founders of the San Francisco-based Cypherpunks. "It's a way to say,
     'Hey, I know this person, we've been collaborating for years. Who are you?'" 
     
     Like others at the event, Gilmore was headed in about four directions at once. That's how it goes when you put together thousands of smart,
     passionate people used to the isolated pursuit of their craft. 
     
     Mass hacking, under the stars no less, was one of the activities. It took on an unlikely charm, especially given its location -- in the main tent next
     to a small, polished-silver spacecraft, a "shuttle" to Chaos' Heart of Gold Web site. 
     
     This weekend's three-day event, the first of its kind in Germany, takes as its inspiration Hacking in Progress, a similarly organized hacking and
     technology festival that took place outside of Amsterdam two summers ago. 
     
     "About 10 Cypherpunks went to HIP two years ago, and they came back with so many stories about how fun it was hanging out with people there.
     Also, they finished proofreading and typing in PGP, Pretty Good Privacy, a computer program that does encryption, so there was an international
     version," said Gilmore. 
     
     "I didn't make it to HIP, but I resolved to go to the next one, and here I am. We have 15 or 20 people here, probably more than a dozen from the
     San Francisco Bay Area, and others scattered around from Berlin and Amsterdam and other parts of Europe. It's a real collegial, friendly sort of
     atmosphere. I'm meeting a lot of great people." 
     The Berlin-based Chaos Computer Club, which organized the weekend, spent a year preparing for the meeting. That comes through in the
     atmosphere of crisp organization that seems to meld seamlessly with a spirit of fun -- the latter best summed up by comments like, "What's it like?
     I've never done pot before." 
     
     "For me, this is more German than HIP," said Ine Poppe, a Dutch documentary filmmaker and artist who worked HIP as a journalist. "It's better
     organized. They learned a lot from the festivals before. 
     
     "From my point of view, HIP had more of a scene of chaos: tents close together and cables all over the place and dance parties into the night.
     Maybe we will have those later." 
     
     Kurt Seifried, a 22-year-old from Edmonton, Alberta, was roaming around the Cypherpunk tent with the exultant air of a student wrapping up finals
     week. 
     
     "I gave a talk during one of the workshops and they didn't throw beer cans at me, so I guess it went all right," he said. "It was my first public
     speaking experience, so it was kind of scary. 
     
     "The worst part was, they canceled the other workshop scheduled for the same time, so I looked up and about 100 people were streaming into the
     tent wanting to be entertained. It was like something out of Pink Floyd's The Wall." 
     
     Seifried's area of expertise is security, the yin to cracking's yang. His 177-page guide to Linux security is posted on the Web. 
     
     "It's encryption at network level to secure things, because right now the Internet is wide open, as people know. I came here to do that, and to
     network a little," he said. 
     
     Yet after the hacking and networking comes the relaxing, and the face-to-face conversations.

55.0 Hackers and Cyberwar "The Threat of Chaos "

     Cyberwar: The Threat of Chaos 
       
     Hackers can
     disrupt, but can
     they make war? 
                        

     Hackers and other
     cyber-vandals have become
     a major threat as the world's
     powers rely increasingly on
     their computers. 
                        
      
                                                    By Bob Sullivan
                                                           MSNBC       
                       
                                                                       
                         
            ôWE HAVE NOTHING to fear but fear itself,ö offered
     Franklin Roosevelt during the throes of the Great
     Depression. He might also have been talking about the
     Information Age, where the power of personal computers
     seems to offer limitless possibilities for both creativity and
     destruction. 
            Not true, the experts say ù there are limits to the
     damage that can be done with zeros and ones. 
            Experts like those at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey
     insist that image of a pimply-faced geek gaining control of
     Defense Department computers is pure science fiction. Even
     an organized ôhackö by well-funded terrorist organizations
     who take control of a nuclear missile facility is fanciful, they
     say ù and hardly worth the trouble. Not when it would be
     so much easier to create equal havoc using much simpler
     methods. 
            
     THINKING SMALL 
     
     æWe are the most technologically advanced country
      in the world, which means we have the most to lose.Æ 
                 
                 ù FRANK CILLUFFO
                   Information warfare
                   specialist 
                    
                    
            Imagine, for example, if the Internet suddenly stopped
     working. A hacker group told Congress it could be done in
     half an hour. Or if power to major cities were disrupted.
     Government-hired hackers did that in four days in 1997. Or
     if parts of the 911 system were cut off. A Swedish hacker
     now in an asylum managed briefly to cut off 911 service in
     Florida two years ago. 
            Such ônuisanceö hacks on infrastructure are less
     dramatic than the hijacking of a missile, but they might be
     more effective.
            ôThe psychological impacts of IW (information
     warfare) canÆt be overstated,ö said Frank Cilluffo, director
     of the Information Warfare Task Force at the Center for
     Strategic and International Studies. ôUsing it, terrorist
     groups can achieve what they cannot militarily.
            ôWe are the most technologically advanced country in
     the world, which means we have the most to lose,ö he
     added. ôThe United States is not very prepared to lose
     power, for example. And how long can you live without that
     database? What if suddenly all e-commerce were cut off?ö 
                                                   
            
     TARGETING FINANCE
            Throw banking into that e-commerce category. During
     the Kosovo conflict, numerous reports suggested U.S.
     intelligence agencies had hired hackers to tinker with
     international bank accounts full of Yugoslav President
     Slobodan MilosevicÆs money. There was plenty of debate in
     the security community about how possible this might be,
     but even the idea sent shudders through the financial
     industry. Once that PandoraÆs box is open ù once one
     governmentÆs hackers are capable of freezing or altering
     personal bank account information ù other governments
     and terrorist organizations surely would follow suit. And
     since the entire banking system is based on confidence, such
     an attack could completely undermine the integrity of the
     banking system, according to Kawika Daguio, executive
     vice president of the Financial Information Protection
     Association. 
            
     THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT
            CilluffoÆs biggest concern is not an all-digital attack, but
     the use of computers as a multiplier for a more traditional
     attack. Imagine if a hacker had disabled 911 during the
     Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. Not only would medical
     help have been severely delayed, leading to more death and
     destruction ù the resulting confusion would at least be
     demoralizing and, at worst, create a panic.
            For proof of the potential for mob psychology, experts
     point to the Y2K bug. Even with several yearsÆ warning and
     continuous announcements that computers are
     Y2K-compliant, banks report cash hoarding has already
     begun, and survivalist-minded individuals are squirreling
     away water and dry goods.
            ôThe actual problem is usually 10 times less damaging
     than the public perception of it,ö said Space Rogue, who
     runs the Hacker News Network service. 
            
     The threat: real or not?
            ThereÆs plenty of debate about how severe the
     cyberthreat is, though recent signals from the U.S.
     government suggest federal agencies are taking it very
     seriously. 
            Just last week, The New York Times was leaked a
     document showing the National Security Council is working
     on a Big Brother-like electronic monitoring system called
     the ôFederal Intrusion Detection Network.ö 
            The planÆs director told the Times: ôWe knowö foreign
     governments are developing cyberwar capabilities, and ôwe
     have good reason to believe that terrorists may be
     developing similar capabilities.ö 
            
     ELIGIBLE RECEIVER
            The National Security AgencyÆs 1997 cyberwar ôfire
     drillö may have inspired the study. In a military exercise
     code-named ôEligible Receiver,ö 35 hackers hired by the
     NSA gained access to 36 of the 40,000 government
     networks within four days. They were able to gain control
     of major power grids and could have disrupted power in
     Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington and New York.
            But nothing nearly so sophisticated is required. In
     testimony to Congress last year, members of the hacker
     group L0pht said they could bring the Internet to its knees in
     less than an hour.
            ôIt is not difficult at all to fool, confuse or corrupt major
     [domain name] servers,ö Dr. Mudge, who testified to
     Congress, told MSNBC. ôThere are many more interesting
     attacks that could be much more devastating, dealing with
     disrupting routing between major tier-one service providers
     (that is, stopping MCI from being able to talk to Sprintnet,
     etc.) and is completely feasible, doable with very little
     effort.ö
            And the number of technologies that might be turned
     against the United States continues to expand with each
     high-tech invention, say several scientists at U.S. high-tech
     labs. Among the most frightening are the advent of MEMS
     ù micro-electro-mechanical systems. These tiny machines,
     potentially smaller than a human cell, may one day be
     injected into the bloodstream as miniature doctors sent to
     beat back viruses or kill cancerous cells. But they could just
     as easily be designed as a lethal combination of high-tech
     and biological warfare, as smart MEMS could be set to
     infect and kill specific kinds of subjects. 
            
     Irrational fears?
            Not everyone is persuaded the threat is all that
     dramatic. After all, hackers did not gain access to the
     PentagonÆs most secure systems. InfoWar.com founder
     Louis Cipher (a pseudonym) says Eligible Receiver and
     other high-profile cyber-threat incidents are part publicity
     stunt aimed at getting more federal money targeted to
     cyberwarfare research.
            ôParanoia is a bad thing, and America is being infected
     quickly,ö Cipher said. ôEverybodyÆs an alarmist.... You can
     disturb an infrastructure. Can go into telephony and can
     cause disturbance, a denial of service. But disturbing
     electrical facilities is difficult. Just like on a railroad, they can
     go from track to track. There are a lot of safeguards.ö
            And despite all the conjecture about cyberwar
     capabilities, thereÆs little evidence it has actually been used.
     In fact, even if the ability to take out power grids with a
     computer is out there, U.S. forces apparently showed a
     distinct reluctance to use the ability during the Kosovo
     conflict. So-called ôsoft bombs,ö which short out electric
     lines, were used to create local power disruptions instead of
     a computer-based attack.
            That satisfies Cilluffo, who thinks the United States
     should hold off crossing the line to cyberwar for as long as
     possible. 
            ôA well-placed bomb may still be easier,ö Cilluffo said.
     ôIf we can go through physical means, then we are not
     compromising a technique that could be used against us....
     After all, we have a lot more to lose.ö

56.0 LOCKDOWN 2000
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From http://www.net-security.org/
      
      by BHZ, Saturday 7th August 1999 on 4:50 pm CET
      New version of Lockdown 2000 has been released - Lockdown 2000 3.0.1.31. In this
      version some bugs are repaired (this build fixes all error messages that some
      Windows 95/98 users had on close and shutdown, fixes the manual scanner bug and
      many more new trojan signatures are added - the current number of trojan versions
      which it detects is 301). More information on the website (www.lockdown2000.com).

57.0 The SMURF attack and smurf amplifiers
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     Contrary to popular belief SMURF attacks are still very much in use and a threat to ISPs as well as users
     alike. The reason for this is that no matter how much you yell certain badly maintained networks STILL 
     continue to act as SMURF AMPLIFIERS. A plain smurf basically ellicits a ping response from several hundred
     machines with a spoofed address and a target return address, a SMURF AMPLIFIER responds more than once to
     the ping, in some cases several (as many as 10 or more ) times. These nets are targetted by the smurfer 
     for their use against the target site... heres a brief description of smurfs and a list of networks that 
     are acting as smurf amplifiers as of this writing with urls on where to go to find current stats. - Ed
     
     
     
     SMURF.C by TFreak
     
     Well, I suppose its `safe' to release this, it seems everyone and their dog has
     it and apparantly (and to my surprise) it still works.
     
     The `smurf' attack is quite simple.  It has a list of broadcast addresses which
     it stores into an array, and sends a spoofed icmp echo request to each of those
     addresses in series and starts again.  The result is a devistating attack upon
     the spoofed ip with, depending on the amount of broadcast addresses used,
     many, many computers responding to the echo request.
     
     Before I continue may I first say that this code was a mistake.  When it was
     written I was not aware of the fact that a) the world would get its hands on it
     and b) it would have such a destructive effect on the computers being used to
     flood.  My ignorance is my mistake.  I extremely regret writing this, but as
     you well know, if things aren't `exploited' then they aren't fixed.
     
     Now that that's cleared up, how do you protect your network?  Well,
     unfortunatly I am not sure how or even if it is possible to protect yourself
     from being hit with it, unless you wanted to deny all incoming icmp traffic at
     the router which isn't the best solution as it renders other useful oddities
     (such as ping and traceroute) unusable.  To prevent your network from being
     used to flood (using up almost all your bandwith therefore creating a denial
     of service upon yourself.. technically) is quite easy and not a great loss to
     your network.  If you filter all incoming icmp traffic to the broadcast address
     at the router none of the machines will respond therefore the attack will not
     work.  This can be done with one line in the router, and I believe a rep from
     texas.net posted the solution for this (perhaps it could be reposted?).
     
     I believe MCI is currently working on a patch or dectector of some kind for it,
     which is available at
             http://www.internetnews.com/isp-news/1997/10/0901-mci.html
     
     Please, patch your networks, if there's nothing to flood with then there's no
     flood.

     OVERVIEW:
     
     The information here provides in-depth information regarding "smurf"
     attacks, with a focus on Cisco routers and how to reduce the effects of
     the attack.  Some information is general and not related to an
     organization's particular vendor of choice; however, it is written with a
     Cisco router focus.  No confirmation has been made to the effects on other
     vendors' equipment; however, others have provided me with information for
     various vendors, which is provided in the document.  See the
     "Acknowledgements" section below for the sources and contact information.
     I am happy to accept information from other colleagues who are willing to
     provide information about other vendors' products in relation to this
     topic.
     
     This paper is always being updated as I receive more information about
     attacks and work with ways to minimize impact.
     
     DESCRIPTION:
     
     The "smurf" attack, named after its exploit program, is the most recent in
     the category of network-level attacks against hosts.  A perpetrator sends
     a large amount of ICMP echo (ping) traffic at broadcast addresses, all of
     it having a spoofed source address of a victim.  If the routing device
     delivering traffic to those broadcast addresses performs the IP broadcast
     to layer 2 broadcast function noted below, most hosts on that IP network
     will take the ICMP echo request and reply to it with an echo reply each,
     multiplying the traffic by the number of hosts responding.  On a
     multi-access broadcast network, there could potentially be hundreds of
     machines to reply to each packet.
     
     Currently, the providers/machines most commonly hit are IRC servers and
     their providers.
     
     There are two parties who are hurt by this attack...  the intermediary
     (broadcast) devices--let's call them "bounce sites", and the spoofed address
     target, or the "victim".  The victim is the target of a large amount of
     traffic that the bounce sites generate.
     
     Let's look at the scenario to paint a picture of the dangerous nature of
     this attack.  Assume a co-location switched network with 100 hosts, and
     that the attacker has a T1.  The attacker sends, say, a 768kb/s stream of
     ICMP echo (ping) packets, with a spoofed source address of the victim, to
     the broadcast address of the "bounce site".  These ping packets hit the
     bounce site's broadcast network of 100 hosts; each of them takes the packet
     and responds to it, creating 100 ping replies outbound.  If you multiply
     the bandwidth, you'll see that 76.8 Mbps is used outbound from the "bounce
     site" after the traffic is multiplied.  This is then sent to the victim (the
     spoofed source of the originating packets).
     
     HOW TO KEEP YOUR SITE FROM BEING THE SOURCE
     PERPETRATORS USE TO ATTACK VICTIMS:
     
     The perpetrators of these attacks rely on the ability to source spoofed
     packets to the "bounce sites" in order to generate the traffic which causes
     the denial of service.
     
     In order to stop this, all networks should perform filtering either at the
     edge of the network where customers connect (access layer) or at the edge
     of the network with connections to the upstream providers.
     
     Paul Ferguson of cisco Systems and Daniel Senie of Daniel Senie consulting
     have written an Internet-draft pertaining to this topic.  See:
     
     ftp://ftp.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ferguson-ingress-filtering-02.txt
     
     for more information on this subject.  The authors expect to have it
     published as an Informational RFC prior to the December IETF meeting.
     
     HOW TO STOP BEING AN INTERMEDIARY:
     
     This attack relies on the router serving a large multi-access broadcast
     network to frame an IP broadcast address (such as 10.255.255.255) into a
     layer 2 broadcast frame (for Ethernet, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).  The RFC for
     routing states that a router MAY perform this translation for directed
     broadcasts.  Because in a few select cases it is desirable, and it hasn't
     been proved undesirable (except in the recent DoS attacks), most vendors
     have chosen to implement this behavior.  Generally, with IP providers and
     the Internet as we know it today, this behavior should not be needed.
     
     (Editor's note: I welcome other examples where this is needed in today's
     networking--see below for a single example I know of.)
     
     Ethernet NIC hardware (MAC-layer hardware, specifically) will only listen
     to a select number of addresses in normal operation.  The one MAC address
     that all devices share in common in normal operation is the media
     broadcast, or FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  In this case, a device will take the
     packet and send an interrupt for processing.
     
     Because most host IP stacks pay little attention to the destination
     address in the IP header of an ICMP packet, or (if they check the IP
     header for ICMP) implement responding to ICMP broadcasts, the packet is
     handed to the ICMP layer, where in the case of smurf attacks, an ICMP echo
     reply is prepared and shipped out to the spoofed address source of the
     packet-- the victim.
     
     To stop your Cisco router from converting these layer 3 broadcasts into
     layer 2 broadcasts, use the "no ip directed-broadcast" interface
     configuration command.  This should be configured on all routers which
     provide routing to large multi-access broadcast networks (generally LANs),
     with more than 5-10 devices.  It is unnecessary on point-to-point
     interfaces, such as POS, serial T1, HSSI, etc., because point-to-point
     interfaces will only generate two replies--one for each end of the link.
     No testing has been done on multipoint frame-relay; routers on NBMA
     networks typically do not forward broadcasts unless explicitly configured
     to do so.  Point-to-point sub-interface models will behave like many
     point-to-point links--again, this command will have little effect,
     stopping only one of the two replies.
     
     Other vendor information:
     
     * Proteon/OpenROUTE:
       Daniel Senie (dts@senie.com) reports that Proteon/OpenROUTE Networks
       routers have an option to turn off directed broadcasts in the IP
       Configuration menus.  The command sequence to turn them off is:
       *CONFIG (on newer routers) or TALK 6 (on older routers)
       Config>PROTOCOL IP
       IP Config>DISABLE DIRECTED-BROADCAST
       A restart of the router is then required.
     * Bay Networks:
       Jon Green (jcgreen@netins.net) reports that under current code, there
       is no way to keep Bay Networks routers from converting layer 3
       broadcasts to layer 2 broadcasts short of applying a per-interface
       filter, eliminating packets to the broadcast.  However, there is a
       feature request to add a configuration option, and it is expected
       to be in BayRS version 12.0.
     
     There is one case study where this will stop intended behavior: In the
     case where samba (an SMB server for UNIX) or NT is used to "remote
     broadcast" into a LAN workgroup so that the workstations on that LAN can
     see the server, this will prevent the LAN machines from seeing the remote
     server.  This is *only* in the case where there is no WINS server (WINS is
     routed unicast) and a "remote broadcast" is being used--it's a rare but
     notable condition.
     
     INFORMATION FOR VICTIMS AND HOW TO SUPPRESS ATTACKS:
     
     The amount of bandwidth and packets per second (pps) that can be generated
     by this attack is quite large.  With a 200-host LAN, I was able to
     generate over 80 Mbits/sec traffic at around 35 Kpps toward my target--a
     pretty significant amount.  The victims receive this because traffic is
     multiplied by the number of hosts on the broadcast network used (in this
     case, with a 200-host network, I was only required to send 400 Kbits/sec
     to the broadcast address--less than one-third of a T1).
     
     Many hosts cannot process this many packets per second; many hosts are
     connected to 10 Mbit/sec Ethernet LANs where more traffic than wire speed
     is sent.  Therefore, the ability to drop these packets at the network
     border, or even before it flows down the ingress pipes, is desired.
     
     (This next section assumes IOS behavior with standard central switching--
     FIB/CEF isn't covered here, the behavior is different, I believe.)
     
     Cisco routers have several "paths" which packets can take to be routed;
     each has a varying degree of overhead.  The slowest of these is "process"
     switching.  This is used when a complex task is required for processing
     packets.  The other modes are variations of a fast path--each of them with
     a set of advantages and disadvantages.  However, they're all handled at
     interrupt level (no process-level time is required to push these packets).
     
     In IOS versions (even the most recent), access-list denies are handled at
     the process (slow) level, because they require an ICMP unreachable to be
     generated to the originating host.  All packets were sent to the process
     level automatically to be handled this way.
     
     Under a recent code change (Cisco bug ID CSCdj35407--integrated in version
     11.1(14)CA and later), packets denied by an access-list will be dropped at
     the interrupt (fast) level, with the exception of 2 packets per second per
     access-list deny line. These 2 packets per second will be used to send the
     "ICMP unreachable via administrative block" messages.  This assumes that
     you don't want to log the access-list violations (via the "log" or
     "log-input"  keywords).  The ability to rate-limit "log-input" access-list
     lines (in order to more easily log these packets) is currently being
     integrated;  see the section below on tracing spoofed packet attacks for
     information on logging.
     
     Filtering ICMP echo reply packets destined for your high-profile machines
     at the ingress interfaces of the network border routers will then permit
     the packets to be dropped at the earliest possible point.  However, it
     does not mean that the network access pipes won't fill, as the packets
     will still come down the pipe to be dropped at the router.  It will,
     however, take the load off the system being attacked.  Keep in mind that
     this also denies others from being able to ping from that machine (the
     replies will never reach the machine).
     
     For those customers of providers who use Cisco, this may give you some
     leverage with the providers' security teams to help save your pipes by
     filtering before the traffic is sent to you.
     
     Efforts are underway to integrate these fixes in the other major versions
     and branches as well.
     
     TRACING SPOOFED PACKET STREAMS:
     
     Tracking these attacks can prove to be difficult, but is possible with
     coordination and cooperation from providers.  This section also assumes
     Cisco routers, because I can speak only about the abilities of Cisco to
     log/filter packets and what impact it may have.
     
     Today, logging packets which pass through or get dropped in an ACL is
     possible; however, all packets with the "log" or "log-input" ACL options
     are sent to process level for logging.  For a large stream of packets,
     this could cause excessive CPU problems.  For this reason, tracking
     attacks via IOS logging today is limited to either lower bandwidth attacks
     (smaller than 10k packets per second).  Even then, the number of log
     messages generated by the router could overload a syslog server.
     
     Cisco bug ID CSCdj35856 addresses this problem.  It has been integrated
     into IOS version 11.1CA releases beginning with 11.1(14.1)CA (a
     maintenance interim release), and makes it possible to log packets at
     defined intervals and to process logged packets not at that interval in
     the fast path.  I will update this page with version numbers as the
     releases are integrated.
     
     Some information on logging:
     
     In later 11.1 versions, a new keyword was introduced for ACL logging:
     "log-input".  A formatted ACL line utilizing the keyword looks like this:
     
     access-list 101 permit icmp any any echo log-input
     
     When applied to an interface, this line will log all ICMP ping packets
     with input interface and MAC address (for multi-access networks).
     Point-to-point interfaces will not have a MAC address listed.
     
     Here's an example of the log entry for a multi-access network (FDDI, Ether):
     
     Sep 10 23:17:01 PDT: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGDP: list 101 permitted icmp
     10.0.7.30 (FastEthernet1/0 0060.3e2f.6e41) -> 10.30.248.3 (8/0), 5 packets
     
     Here's an example of the log entry for a point-to-point network:
     
     Sep 10 23:29:00 PDT: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGDP: list 101 permitted icmp
     10.0.7.30 (BRI0 *PPP*) -> 10.0.19.242 (8/0), 1 packet
     
     Substituting "log" for "log-input" will eliminate the incoming interface
     and MAC address from the log messages.
     
     We'll use the first log entry to demonstrate how to go from here.  This
     log entry means the packet came in on FastEthernet1/0, from MAC address
     0060.3e2f.6e41, destined for 10.30.248.3.  From here, you can use "show ip
     arp" (if needed) to determine the IP address for the MAC address, and go
     to the next hop for tracing or contact the necessary peer (in the case of
     an exchange point).  This is a hop-by-hop tracing method.
     
     Example of "show ip arp" used to find next hop:
     
     netlab#show ip arp 0060.3e2f.6e41
     Protocol  Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Type   Interface
     Internet  10.0.183.65            32   0060.3e2f.6e41  ARPA   FastEthernet1/0
     
     As you can see, 10.0.183.65 is the next hop where the packets came from
     and we should go there to continue the tracing process, utilizing the same
     ACL method.  By doing this, you can track the spoof attack backwards.
     
     While this is general information on tracking spoofed packets, it must be
     noted that the victims of a smurf attack get packets from the listed source
     in the packets; i.e., they receive echo-reply packets truly from the source
     listed in the IP header.  This information should be used by the bounce sites
     or intermediaries to track the spoofed echo _request_ packets back to
     their source (the perpetrator).
     
     MCI's Internet Security team has put together a perl script which, in an
     automated fashion, can log into your Cisco routers and trace a spoof attack
     back to its source.  The program is available, free of charge.  See
     http://www.security.mci.net/dostracker/ for more information.
     
     OTHER DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS WORTHY OF MENTION:
     
     Two other denial of service attacks frequently encountered are TCP SYN
     floods, and UDP floods aimed at diagnostic ports on hosts.
     
     TCP SYN attacks consist of a large number of spoofed TCP connection set-up
     messages aimed at a particular service on a host.  Older TCP
     implementations cannot handle many faked connection set-up packets, and
     will not allow access to the victim service.
     
     The most common form of UDP flooding directed at harming networks is an
     attack consisting of a large number of spoofed UDP packets aimed at
     diagnostic ports on network devices.  This attack is also known as the
     "pepsi" attack (again named after the exploit program), and can cause
     network devices to use up a large amount of CPU time responding to these
     packets.
     
     To get more information on minimizing the effects of these two attacks,
     see:

     PERFORMANCE INFORMATION:
     
     One ISP has reported that, spread across three routers (2 RSP2 and 1
     RSP4), the fast drop code eliminated a sustained 120 Mbits/sec smurf
     attack and kept the network running without performance problems.
     
     As always, your mileage may vary.

     T. Freak's posted his smurf code, and there's been a few messages
     concerning this d.o.s. attack -- I guess now is a good of a time as any to
     release this little script.
     
     I'm sure there's a more efficient way of putting something like this
     together, but... oh well.  Results of the scan are reported into
     ./bips.results
     
     note: this script has two parts.
     
     --- bips.sh ---
     
     #!/bin/bash
     # find broadcast ip's that reply with 30+ dupes.
     
     # i decided to make this script into two sections. when running this make
     # sure both parts are in the same directory.
     
     if [ $# != 1 ]; then
     echo "$0 &lt;domain - ie: college.edu>"
     else
     host -l $1 | grep 'has address' | cut -d' ' -f4 > $1.ips
     cat $1.ips | cut -d'.' -f1-3 | sort |\
     awk '{ print echo ""$1".255" }' > $1.tmp
     cat $1.tmp | uniq | awk '{ print "./chekdup.sh "$1"" }' > $1.ping
     rm -f $1.ips $1.tmp
     chmod 700 $1.ping
     ./$1.ping
     rm $1.ping
     fi
     
     --- chekdup.sh ---
     
     #!/bin/bash
     # this checks possible broadcast ip's for a given amount of icmp echo
     # replies.
     
     ping -c 2 $1 > $1.out
     if
     cat $1.out | grep dupl > /dev/null
     then
     export DUPES="`cat $1.out | grep dupl | cut -d'+' -f2 | cut -d' ' -f1`"
     else

     Preventing Smurf Attacks 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.nordu.net/articles/smurf.html



     Introduction

     This brief introduction to the denial-of-service attacks of the SMURF type (named after the program used to instigate the attack) explains what they
     are and what can be done about them.

     In a SMURF attack you can be affected in one of several ways: 

          As a victim or target of the attack 
          As a network which is abused to amplify the attack 
          As a party harboring the instigator of the attack 

     SMURF and similar Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can do serious damage to your network services, be it either as an individual end-user or as
     an entire institution in that your network or host can be inundated with unwanted and maliciously sent traffic. 

     Anatomy of a SMURF Attack

     A SMURF attack (named after the program used to perform the attack) is a method by which an attacker can send a moderate amount of traffic
     and cause a virtual explosion of traffic at the intended target. The method used is as follows: 

          The attacker sends ICMP Echo Request packets where the source IP address has been forged to be that of the target of the attack. 
          The attacker sends these ICMP datagrams to addresses of remote LANs broadcast addresses, using so-called directed broadcast
          addresses. These datagrams are thus broadcast out on the LANs by the connected router. 
          All the hosts which are ½alive╗ on the LAN each pick up a copy of the ICMP Echo Request datagram (as they should), and sends an ICMP
          Echo Reply datagram back to what they think is the source. If many hosts are ½alive╗ on the LAN, the amplification factor can be
          considerably (100+ is not uncommon). 
          The attacker can use largish packets (typically up to ethernet maximum) to increase the ½effectiveness╗ of the attack, and the faster network
          connection the attacker has, the more damage he can inflict on the target and the target's network. 

     Not only can the attacker cause problems for the target host, the influx of traffic can in fact be so great as to have a seriously negative effect on the
     upstream network(s) from the target. In fact, those institutions being abused as amplifier networks can also be similarly affected, in that their
     network connection can be swamped by the Echo Reply packets destined for the target. 

     Preventing SMURF attacks

     PROPERLY CONFIGURED NETWORK EQUIPMENT IS THE KEY

     The availability of the directed broadcast function is an important element in these attacks. The current Proposed Standard for "Requirements for
     IP Version 4 Routers" (RFC1812) states that a router must default to forwarding directed broadcasts, that a knob must exist to turn it off, but it
     must default to the ½on╗ position (see section 5.3.5.2 of RFC1812). However, the current sentiment is that this should no longer be a requirement.

     Thus, to prevent your network from being abused as an amplifier network in a SMURF attack, you should turn off the forwarding of directed
     broadcast on all router ports or take other measures to assure your network cannot be abused in this manner.

     Another component which is important in this type of attack is that the attacker has to be able to inject packets into the network with forged IP
     source addresses. It is possible to enable functions in routers which will prevent the trivial forgery of IP source addresses, and doing so for a local
     network will prevent SMURF attacks from being launched locally. (Do however note that access lists can have a performance impact, so judicious
     use of such tools is advised.) This sort of ingress filtering has been documented in RFC2267, and is effective not only for preventing local
     origination of SMURF attacks, and also makes tracking attacks (or denying origination of attacks) much easier.

     Since SMURF attacks use forged source addresses, tracking SMURF attacks back to their source can be a challenge. It has to be done while the
     attack is ongoing, and requires the swift cooperation of all the network service providers along the path. In practice this has proven to be quite
     difficult. Instead, what we have done in NORDUnet is to set a rate-limit on the volume of ICMP Echo Reply traffic we allow into NORDUnet. This
     is so that we can ½soften╗ the effect of an attack originated outside of NORDUnet directed at a host inside NORDUnet.

     For more detailed instructions as to how to take precautionary measures see Craig A. Huegen's page describing SMURF attacks. There is also an
     informal SMURF Amplifier Registry housed by the norwegian ISP PowerTech, which in the form of a ½hall of shame╗ lists active amplifier

     AntiOnline to Write Productive, Sense Making Article 
     Contributed by siko
     Tuesday - July 20, 1999. 04:24PM UTC 

          Early this afternoon, sources close to Innerpulse Media leaked information
      coming from the offices of AntiOnline.

      "He said he is going to write an article that doesn't piss all the fish in the pond
      off.", said the anonymous source. "I think he mentioned something about social
      engineering passwords."

      Speculation has grown throughout the day as to what could be posted on
      AntiOnline.com that actually makes sense and doesn't piss everyone off at the
      same time. 

      "Not everything on there lacks content or doesn't make a point. I really enjoyed
      reading about the Granny Hacker from Heck. And that story about the new
      Super Computer coming out was really great the third time around on
      AntiOnline.com. I just wasn't in the mood two weeks ago."

     The Bastard System Manager From Hell #1
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     I get into my office and it's my first day - I want to make a good impression, so I empty my IN 
     tray into the bin. Now that's what I call efficient!
     
     I get a call from the big boss - he's been getting complaints about the trainee bastard operator
     from hell. I ask him to forward all the complaints to me and that it would be best to let me deal
     with them. I ring the operator and get him to make an appointment with me.
     
     Two weeks later, he does, and I show him the complaints that have accumulated so far.
     
     "Seventy Three complaints in your first three weeks!" I shout "It's good - but it's NOT Good Enough!
     You should be getting at least 10 complaints a day - AT LEAST! Now, let's see what you're doing wrong:
     You get a call from a user - what do you do?"
     
     "Kill them off?" The TBOFH replies
     
     "NO! How can you kill them off if you don't know their USERNAME? Your FIRST priority is to get their 
     username. Then what would you do?"
     
     "Kill them off?"
     
     "NO! Get them to tell you what their problem is!"
     
     "Why?"
     
     "Because later I can say they didn't explain their problem to you properly! It's a great defence - 
     works every time. A user rings me up to complain; I listen to their problem, then say "OH, WHEN YOU 
     SAID `MY PC DOESN'T WORK' HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT YOU MEANT `HOW CAN I MAKE MY PC NEVER WORK AGAIN AND 
     DESTROY MY LIFE'S WORK AT THE SAME TIME?' - IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME!' then they tell me how implausible
     that is, I say how terribly sorry we are, then fake some connect and CPU time records so their monthly 
     bill is about the same as the Uraguayan national debt...Understand? So, after you've heard their problem,
     what do you do?"
     
     "Kill them off?"
     
     "NO! Then you make up some excuse. Have you got an excuse card calendar?"
     
     "Uh. No.."
     
     "And you said you were qualified to operate a computer! You'd better have mine." I pass my computer card calendar over, flipping it to page one -
     "ENTROPY"....... ...I like it. "Now, you give the cretin an excuse then what do you do?"
     
     "Kill them off?"
     
     "YES!" (He certainly has a fixation) "Then what?"
     
     "Hang up?"
     
     "NO! Then they'll call you back when the problem recurs. Your job is to make them FEAR calling you. How can you work when people are calling? So, you make
     them pay for calling in the first place. What would you do?"
     
     "Delete their files?"
     
     "Yeah, it's a start, but then they may call back when they get new files. You want them NEVER to call back. What could you do?"
     
     "Swear at them?"
     
     "No. I can see we'll have to demonstrate. Have you got a metal ballpoint?"
     
     "Yes"
     
     "See that wallsocket over there. Take the refill out of the pen and poke in into the wallsocket."
     
     "But it's live!"
     
     "Would I really make you do it if it were live?"
     
     "Oh" >fiddle< >fiddle< >BZZZZZZZEEEEERT!< >THUD!<
     
     of course I would. He was no good anyway. No killing instinct.

 SITE.1 Three sites this week
 
   
    #1  http://www.seifried.org/lasg/
        
        Linux Administrators Security Guide
        
        Available in PDF format, a must read for all Sysadmins.
        
        Not much to say about this site, its not flashy, its totally utilitarian and is the place
        from which you should get the LASG in its updated form or redirect to mirror sites. 
        
                                                             rated: no rating  - Ed
        
        Bored?
        
   #2   http://www.policescanner.com/
        
        This site will let you listen via realaudio to scanner output from various areas around the
        States, very interesting stuff even (or especially) for you out of towners, good for those
        boring weekend nights when scanner traffic is especially busy. Appeals to those that never
        miss an episode of COPS or are radio enthusiasts... rated: 7/10 - eentity
        
        
        Are you missing Packetstorm Security and really want to download some juarez?
                
   #3   http://secureroot.m4d.com/hackattack/files/
           
        try this site, they have a fairly decent archive of older philez, nice flashy site but not
        overly done, somewhat of a rootshell flavour....     rated: 7/10 - eentity

          * Hackers Against Racist Propaganda (See issue #7)

      AntiOnline Hacked? 
      Thursday, August 5, 1999 at 13:43:28
      by John Vranesevich - Founder of AntiOnline 
 
      Following its policy about full site disclosure, AntiOnline offers the
      following statement:
 
      AntiOnline's newest feature, "Eye On The Underground", gathers data
      from several well known underground websites. The data is gathered
      dynamically once an hour via "AntiEye", one of our custom
      info-gathering applications.
 
      Today, one of the sites that we gather data from, Bikkel.com's message
      board, changed the format of their content to feed our website
      information other than that which was intended to be viewed from their
      actual webboard.
 
      Although this change in format in no way compromised the integrity of
      our servers, or the data contained therein, it did cause alternate
      information to be displayed on the "Eye On The Underground" section of
      our website to users who had specific versions of the Netscape and IE
      webbrowsers. We apologize to our users for the temporary disruption of
      this service.
 
      AntiOnline receives a hack attempt an average of once every 2 minutes,
      no one has ever successfully infiltrated any of our systems, or the data
      contained on them.
      
           
      and more sites at the attrition cracked web sites mirror:

     This is an old and (should be) dead issue with Windows 95 boxen. The Ping Of Death (PoD) was
     quite rampant, and created havoc on irc and elsewhere in its day, you can test your box for
     PoD vulnerability by using the following batchfile. Note that results do not always occur
     immediately, but sometimes occur several minutes after the 'attack'.... included for the hell
     of it, I was bored, the file was just there so wtf? you know? kinda like trying an old exploit
     you KNOW is gonna be patched but wanna try it anyway? sometimes with newer versions of software
     old bugs are reintroduced so don't throw away all your old DoS programs or exploits, check your
     systems regularily.... - DrunkPhuX
