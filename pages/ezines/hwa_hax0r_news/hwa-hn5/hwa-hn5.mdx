   Synopsis
   --------     
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

  A.A 100% Bikkel is no more
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
      
      The End
      update by demoniz at Feb 5 , 12:45 CET
    
      This will come, without doubt, as a surprise to you, 100 % Pure Bikkel
      quits. For a long time now I published daily news for the hacker scene,
      several times a day, seven days a week. A typical example of a hobby
      which got out of hand. A hobby which became a fulltime job. And a job
      which gave me a lot of recognition, but unfortunately didn't pay my bills.
    
      No I do not quit because there's little money coming in through this
      site. Nor do I have financial difficulties. I quit because I want to. I want to
      devote myself again to my other job, a freelance journalist here in the
      Netherlands. I thought about this during my holiday and gave it some
      more thought in the past weeks. It's a well thought-out, rational
      decision.
    
      Sure I could reduce the number of updates. More time, no 'The End.' I
      won't do it. I live by the motto: 'If you can't do it right, don't do it at all.'
      News works in mysterious ways. It's time-independent. If there's news,
      it has to be published immediate. Otherwise you'll behind the times. I
      don't want that.
    
      It's time to move on. And that's what I'm about to do.
    
      Greetz to you all
    
      demoniz 
      
      Greets and thanks

      It wouldn't be possible to maintain this site without the help of all
      contributors. I'd like to thank all of you for submitting news.
      Without you there wouldn't be any news.

      There are some people who deserve some 'special' attention.

      Qubik: The man behind the show.

      Spikeman: Submitted on a regular base news. You rule.

      Space Rogue: Editor of HNN. Several breaking stories made you the man.

      Ken Williams: We all know Packet Storm Security and we all love it.

      splazzatch & loser: My favorite posters on the board.

      Iron-Lungs: Man, I wrote so much about you, you just have to be on this list :)

      cruciphux: Editor of hwa.hax0r.news. My favorite ezine. Damn funny.

      thejian: Just a cool guy who often gave me news.

      (Very likely that I forgot to mention someone, forgive me :) 

      
      Goodbye
      ~~~~~~~

      Thanks for the great site demoniz, best wishes and good luck with your other
      "real" job, and we hope to see you "around" from time to time. - Cruciphux
      and the staff of HWA.

    What is Bugtraq?     

    Bugtraq is a full-disclosure UNIX security mailing list, (see the info
    file) started by Scott Chasin &lt;chasin@crimelab.com>. To subscribe to 
    bugtraq, send mail to listserv@netspace.org containing the message body

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file: 

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them. 

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their 
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of 
    security holes and risks. 

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter. 

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list. 

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list: 

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present) 
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above 
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes 
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings 
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security 
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures 
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations 
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting 

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria. 

    Remember: YOYOW. 

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on this list and that reproduction of
    those words without your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be challenged by you, the author.

    REASONS FOR INCEPTION
    ---------------------

    In order to compile the average security administrator, it was found
    that the compiler had to parse a foreboding number of exceptionally
    noisy and semantically devoid data sets.  This typically resulted in
    dramatically high load averages and a frightening increase in core
    entropy.

    Further, the number, names and locations of required datum seem to
    change on an almost daily basis; requiring tedious version control
    on the part of the mental maintainer.


   OVERVIEW
   ---------

    Best-of-Security is at presently moderated randomly based on a
    cryptographically secure RNG. Bizarre? Sound strange given our
    stated purpose of massive entropy reduction? Because best often
    equates with "vital" and the moderator doesn't have an MDA habit it
    is important that material sent to this list be delivered to its
    subscribers' in as minimal period of time as is (in)humanly
    possible. [ Actually, that isn't the only reason; following the
    Prodigy liability verdict, content-active moderators were found to
    have the legal burdens of regular publishers. BOS gets some dubious
    people posting very interesting things from undisclosed sources.
    -Mod ]

    If you find information from *any* source (including other
    mailinglists, newsgroups, conference notes, papers, etc) that fits
    into one of the acceptable categories described at the end of this
    document then you should *immediately* send it to
    "best-of-security@suburbia.net". Do not try and predict whether or
    not someone else will send the item in question to the list in the
    immediate future. Unless your on a time-delayed mail vector such as
    polled uucp or the item has already appeared on best-of-security,
    mail the info to the list!  Even if it is a widely deployed piece of
    information such as a CERT advisory the proceeding argument still
    applies. If the information hasn't appeared on this list yet, then
    SEND IT.  It is far better to run the risk of minor duplication in
    exchange for having the information out where it is needed than act
    conservatively about occasional doubling up on content.

    We do, of course take original posts. In the famous last words of
    Marylin Munroe, CORE Digest and Joachim Kroll: "meat, we want meat".

    Back issues of best-of-security digest are available from:
    
            ftp://suburbia.net/pub/mailinglists/best-of-security
    
    You can also instruct the mailing list processor to automatically scan and
    retrive messages from the archive. It understands the following commands:
    
            get filename ...
            ls directory ...
            egrep case_insensitive_regular_expression filename ...
            maxfiles nnn
            version
    
            Aliases for 'get': send, sendme, getme, gimme, retrieve, mail
            Aliases for 'ls': dir, directory, list, show
            Aliases for 'egrep': search, grep, fgrep, find
    
            Lines starting with a '#' are ignored.
            Multiple commands per mail are allowed.
            Setting maxfiles to zero will remove the limit (to protect you against
            yourself no more than maxfiles files will be returned per request).
            Egrep supports most common flags.
    
            Examples:
            ls latest (the latest directory containes the archived messages)
            get latest/12
            egrep some.word latest/*

     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.
     
     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state

    !=   - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
           ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
           an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
           to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint 
           fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)      
    AAM  - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

  2.1 POWAR - An idea who's time has come(?) opens itself up for inspection
      =--=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      By HWA Staff, Feb '99
      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
      
      P.O.W.A.R - PHACVW Online Web Archive Resource
      
            
       Well at the moment it is little more than a somewhat trendy catch-
      phrase but its an idea that AFAIK has not yet been attempted by the
      online world, specifically the online underground world. What POWAR
      stands for, other than an attempt at being catchy is PHAC Online Web 
      Archive Ring (or Resource, if you prefer) what POWAR attempts to do is 
      bring people in the underground together to be distribution nodes for a 
      vast list of growing files (checked out Packetstorm lately?)  creating 
      one decentralized source for info  and files by means of a distributed 
      web approach. Consider a list of 1000 1 meg files of various import, a 
      master list would be maintained by all POWAR net sites. Each site might
      have 4 of the listed files, with the rest being distributed among other
      POWAR sites. 
      
     Advantages:  Participants can maintain unique site characteristics but 
                newbie  cookie-cutter sites won't be turned away so long   as 
                they try and  maintain their perspective in the ring if  nothing 
                else, it will give them a firm foundation point from  which to 
                build their own online presence.
                   
     *         No porno banners will be allowed (* up for debate) on POWAR sites
               the net is about dissemination of information not ramming titty
               down kiddiez throats, I know where to go for tit, I don't need to
               see it on every second phac site thanks...
      
               All the eggs aren't in one basket, if one site goes down another
               in the queue can take its place and offer its' files
            
               One site doesn't control access to all the files
                  
               One site's speed doesn't determine accessibility to files
                   
               One country doesn't determine authority over the POWAR project
               files archive.
      

  Disadvantages: All links in the chain must maintain contact with each other
                 to determine the current health of the net and monitor downed
                 sites or adjust for heavy traffic items to be distributed to 
                 offset the xfer load.
                    
                 possible adverse affect on general net use if Geocities/Tripod 
                 etc decide to ban 'POWAR' sites.
                    
                 Coordination  either manually or automatically, preferably the
                 former since the latter begs open assaults by government or other
                 hacking groups.
                 
                   
      Its a simple enough concept, perhaps too simple, I'll leave this hanging in the
      wind and perhaps put a poll out to see what people think of the idea on a web
      board or two. Meanwhile send any comments, suggestions, ideas or requests to the
      zine at hwa@press.usmc.net with 'POWAR' in the subject line. To either sign up or
      make a comment etc, if 'joining' include your website url and how much space you
      can dedicate to the project and what else you may be willing to do or who else
      you can contact that may be of service to this goal and we'll take it from here.
      
     This is not an attempt at flouting the HWA name or myself, merely something I had
     eating away at the back of my mind for some time now and decided to let it out and 
     see what people thought .... so there it is.

     Guninski's IE 4 reading AUTOEXEC.BAT.

 
     There is a bug in Internet Explorer 4.x (patched) which allows reading
     local files and sending them to an arbitrary server.

     The problem is: if you add '%01someURL' after the an about: URL, IE 
     thinks that the document is loaded from the domain of 'someURL'.

     This circumvents "Cross-frame security" and opens several security holes.


     This will try to read C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT using TDC.

     The bug may be exploited using HTML mail message. The exploit uses 
     Javascript.

     Guninski's IE 4 window spoofing.
     http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1711/read4.html

     There is a bug in Internet Explorer 4.01 (patched) which allows "window spoofing".

     The problem is: if you add '%01someURL' after the URL, IE thinks that the document is loaded from the domain of 'someURL'.

     This circumvents "Cross-frame security" and opens several security holes.

     After visiting a hostile page (or clicking a hostile link) a window is opened and its location is a trusted site.
     However, the content of the window is not that of the original site, but it is supplied by the owner of the page.
     So, the user is mislead he is browising a trusted site, 
     while he is browsing a hostile page and may provide sensitive information, such as credit card number.

     The bug may be exploited using HTML mail message. The exploit uses Javascript.

     From: Vesselin Bontchev &lt;bontchev@COMPLEX.IS>
     To: NTBUGTRAQ@LISTSERV.NTBUGTRAQ.COM
     Subject: IE 4/5/Outlook + Word 97 security hole
     
     Hello folks,
     
     This is not a strictly Windows NT issue - it affects Windows 9x users
     too. However, it is a very important one, so I decided to post about it
     here.
     
     Remember the so-called "Russian New Year" problem in Excel? Forget it;
     that was peanuts. Exploiting it required substantial knowledge of Excel,
     Windows programming, and assembly language (because the size of the
     programs that could be dropped was minimal). Not that uncommon
     combination, but one requiring at least some level of knowledge and
     experience from the attacker. This new problem can be exploited much,
     MUCH easier - and all the attacker has to know is Visual Basic for
     Applications.
     
     Essentially, if you are using Internet Explorer 4.x or 5.x and Word 97
     (the beta, the original release, SR-1, or the SR-2 patch), you are
     vulnerable. Vulnerable, in the sense that just visting a Web page can
     result in running a hostile VBA program on your machine without any
     warnings. If, in addition, you are using Outlook (any version of it),
     you are even more vulnerable - the attacker can run a hostile VBA
     program on your machine by just sending you an HTML e-mail message. (The
     hostile program will be run when you just VIEW the message - no need to
     click on any links.) The hostile program can do just about anything
     (drop a virus, delete files, steal information) - VBA is an extremely
     powerful language - and very easily.
     
     The problem consists of several parts. The first part is caused by the
     fact that by default IE 4.x/5.x automatically launches
     Word/Excel/PowerPoint to view URLs which point to DOC/XLS/PPT files (and
     all other file extensions for these applications). That is, you are not
     given the option to save the file to disk instead of opening it. If the
     file contains hostile macros, these macros could be executed by the
     respective application.
     
     Microsoft "protects" you from such attacks with the so-called built-in
     macro virus protection of the Office 97 versions of the applications
     mentioned above. That is, if the document you are trying to open
     contains any macros, the application will display a warning by default
     (this can be easily turned off) and will offer you the options to open
     the document as is, to open it without the macros (the default), or not
     to open it at all. Please note that this protection is available only in
     Office 97 - the previous versions of these applications do not have it
     (except the rare Word 7.0a). But they aren't vulnerable to the attack I
     am describing anyway.
     
     This protection has several problems. First of all, it often causes
     false positives - it sometimes triggers even when the document does not
     contain any macros. (I can elaborate when exactly this happens, if there
     is interest.) This often causes people to turn it off. Second, it
     doesn't tell you whether the document contains a virus or not - it just
     warns you about the generic presense of macros. Third, and worst of all,
     the Word 97 implementation of it contains a serious security hole.
     
     When Word 97 opens a document, the built-in macro virus protection
     checks this document for macros (VBA modules). However, it doesn't
     perform a similar check on the template this document is based on - and,
     if this template contains any auto macros, they will be executed when
     the document based on it is opened. Without any warnings whatsoever.
     
     I have discovered and documented this security hole more than two and a
     half years ago. I have reported it to Microsoft people at several
     anti-virus conferences. Microsoft did nothing about it - until recently.
     
     The third part of the problem is the most substantial one - the part
     which makes this attack easy to carry out remotely. Normally, I wouldn't
     have revealed the technical details about it. However, the bad guys have
     figured it out already - there is at least one Web site which tempts the
     user to click on a link allegedly containing a "list of sex sites
     passwords" and which uses this attack to infect the user's machine with
     a macro virus which infects both Word 97, Excel 97 and PowerPoint 97
     documents. :-(
     
     So, the third part of the problem is caused by the fact that when
     specifying the template a Word 97 document is based on, you can specify
     not just a local file but also an URL. The previous versions of Word do
     not have this capability, therefore they are not vulnerable to this
     attack.
     
     I had prepared a demonstration of the attack and it seems to have been
     impressive enough, because Microsoft reacted rather quickly this time -
     in about a week. They issued a patch which fixed the second part of the
     problem - with it, the built-in macro virus protection of Word 97 checks
     for macros not only the document that is being opened but also the
     template it is based on. Please see
     
       Microsoft Security Bulletin:
       http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-002.asp
       Office Update Download Page:
       http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/downloaddetails/wd97sp.htm
     
     for more information.
     
     Folks, if you are using IE 4.x/5.x and/or Outlook and Word 97, you
     _*MUST*_ install this patch! Otherwise your systems are WIDE opened and
     the security hole is *trivial* to exploit! Note, however, that the patch
     will install only on Word 97 SR-1 or SR-2. It will *not* install on the
     original Word 97. If you patch Word 97 SR-1, this will not prevent from
     patching it later to SR-2.
     
     I would also advise you to make the necessary changes so that IE offers
     you the option to save the remote DOC/DOT files instead of automatically
     launching Word to view them. In order to do this, start the Explorer
     (the file explorer, not IE), select View/Options/File Types, find the
     types Microsoft Word &lt;anything> (where &lt;anything> stands for Addin,
     Backup Document, Document, Template, Wizard and anything else you find
     there), select each one of them in sequence, click on the Edit button
     and make sure that the checkbox labeled "Confirm Open After Download"
     (near the bottom of the dialog that appears) is checked.
     
     And, in general, do not trust files with executable content received
     >from dubious sources. Unfortunately, as Microsoft continues to blur the
     difference between your local hard disk and the Internet, problems like
     this one will only get worse. :-( I wonder when we'll see another
     Internet Worm based on a security hole like that... Connectivity is a
     good thing, but it has to rely on a sound security model - not on a
     bunch of patched-together last-minute ugly hacks which try to "protect"
     you by essentially telling you that "you are doing something, are you
     sure?".

6.1 Netscape 4.5 Bugs
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
      Just to keep things even we came across some Netscape bugs from the uploads
     are of Packet Storm, so here's the latest NS poop as well;
    
     Date: Tue, 2 Feb 1999 13:42:32 -0800
     From: Giao Nguyen &lt;grail@CAFEBABE.ORG>
     To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
     Subject: Unsecured server in applets under Netscape
     
     Just for kicks, I wrote a sample applet that listened on a socket. I
     discovered that when the applet was loaded under Netscape (as tested
     with version 4.5), any hosts could then connect to the machine running
     this applet. I won't bore anyone with the code because it's so trivial
     that a novice to Java should be able to write it with ease after
     reading some documentation.
     
     According to Java in a Nutshell, 2nd edition, p. 139:
     
     * Untrusted code cannot perform networking operations, exception
     certain restricted ways.  Untrusted code cannot:
       [...]
       - Accept network connections on ports less than or equal to 1024 or
         from any host other than the one from which the code itself was
         loaded.
     
     While the port number restriction is held by the VM, the point of
     origin restriction is not held at all.
     
     I don't feel qualified to comment on the full implication of this but
     I'm sure more inventive minds can arrive at more interesting uses of
     this feature.
     
     The work around is rather simple. Disable Java runtime in the Netscape
     browser.
     
     As hinted above, Internet Explorer's Java runtime does not exhibit
     this behaviour.
     
     I have contacted Netscape (via some truly useful web pages) but I've
     not received any responses to the following information. I hope it's
     useful to someone out there.

     You'd think so. Don't worry. I sat on this bug for two days to verify
     that I had everything workin right and that I didn't have any funny
     servers on my favorite port numbers. I tend to use 6969 whenever I
     want to test something. The first iteration of this worked. I was
     shocked.
     
     A coworker mentioned the exact same thing you did. So I put it on our
     development server. Loaded the web page. Same result. I then telnet to
     a machine approximately 3000 miles away on a separate network
     unrelated to the network I was on. Same result. Just for kicks I got
     some folks from other companies to help me verify that lunch didn't
     include liquids which the company might frown upon. Same result.
     
     The fact that my test was done on a Windows box and others repeated
     the tests on a Unix platform confirmed that this was not a Windows +
     Netscape related problem but that it was indeed a Netscape specific
     thing.

     Yes, CLASSPATH contamination. I am aware of this.
     
     To verify that it's not CLASSPATH contamination, I'm putting the

     anything other than allow connections to be made. It listens on 6969
     btw. Now, the security measures as implemented by Netscape doesn't
     allow for the equivalence of an accept() call to be made. However, it
     could present an opportunity for DoS attacks. The source is at
     http://www.cafebabe.org/Sapplet.java .
     
     In retrospect, I think the topic is wrong. It should have been
     different. The opportunity is still present for those who has a use
     for such thing. YMMV.

     This page contains an applet listening on port 6969. It doesn't do
           anything other than that.  How useful is it?

     Confirmed on Netscape 4.5 running on an NT 4 SP 4 box.
     
     Loaded up a similar applet on the internal network without standard applet
     callback methods of stop() or destroy().  Kill the window that opened the
     applet and the socket remains running (as expected, and only if some other
     application in the same process space is running).
     
     Fun!

7.0 The Datalynx Hole

      After reading a L0pht advisory on DataLynx suGuard, I went to their
    website to download the product to test it myself. In a matter of minutes I could
    download their whole users database. Personal addresses, e-mails, phone
    numbers and such. 

     Stupid enough, their Perl sign-up script uses a 'setup file', which is
    world-readable (the script run off http must read it, I presume). Instead of, oh I
    don't know, putting the setup files in a web-readable directory, or restricting
    web access to it. Anyways, it's readable, and that 'setup' file contains locations
    of, a database, pgp temporary file, other Perl scripts and such. I sent e-mail to
    the company about it, never got a reply.     
    
    A setup file

    &lt;P>This DataLynx, Inc. Software Evaluation Agreement ("Agreement") by and between DataLynx, Inc., a California corporation ("DataLynx, Inc." or "Licensor") having its principal offices at 6633 Convoy Court, San Diego, CA 92111 USA, and&lt;U> &lt;/U>("Licensee"), and any person or Corporation who evaluates Licensor's products sets forth the terms and conditions under which Licensee may use the evaluation computer software ("Program"), Manuals, and other system documentation (collectively, "Documentation") currently available from DataLynx, Inc. for the Program.&lt;/P>&lt;DIR>
    
    &lt;B>&lt;P>1. Scope of Use. Licensee may:&lt;/P>
    &lt;/B>&lt;P>A.&#9;Install and use the Program only at Licensee's own facility and only for the purpose of evaluating its effectiveness and suitability for Licensee's internal business activities;&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>B.&#9;Make one copy of the Program for said purposes; and&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>C.&#9;Use the documentation only in conjunction with installation and use of the Program for the stated purpose.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>D.&#9;Licensee agrees not to rely on Program in any way that may affect Licensee's normal business operations.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>E.&#9;Licensee may only use the evaluation program and documentation as set forth above and licensee's rights are not transferable.&lt;/P>
    &lt;B>&lt;P>2.&#9;Term.&lt;/P>
    &lt;/B>&lt;P>A.&#9;Licensee may use the Program and Documentation for 30 days after receipt, unless terminated sooner hereunder. Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the evaluation period, Licensee must remove the Program and Documentation files from Licensee's computer system unless Licensee agrees with DataLynx, Inc. to acquire a license to use the Program on an on-going basis.&lt;/P>
    &lt;B>&lt;P>3.&#9;Proprietary Protection.&lt;/P>
    &lt;/B>&lt;P>A.&#9;Licensee acknowledges that DataLynx, Inc. claims it has sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in and to the Program and Documentation (including all Trade Secrets pertaining thereto), subject only to the rights and privileges expressly granted by DataLynx, Inc.. This Agreement does not provide Licensee with Title or ownership of the Program or Documentation, but only a right of limited use.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>B.&#9;The Program and Documentation, and the Trade Secrets contained therein (collectively, the "Proprietary Information"), are commercially valuable, proprietary products of DataLynx, Inc., which are treated by DataLynx, Inc. as confidential. DataLynx, Inc. has entrusted the Proprietary Information to Licensee in confidence to use only as expressly authorized. As used herein, Trade Secrets include any scientific or technical information, concept, design, process, procedure, formula, or improvement that is commercially valuable and secret (in the sense that its confidentiality affords DataLynx, Inc. a competitive advantage over its competitors).&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>C.&#9;Exceptions to Proprietary Information. The obligations of confidentiality and restriction on use in Section B shall not apply to any Proprietary Information that: (i) was in the public domain prior to the date of this Agreement or subsequently came into the public domain through no fault of the Licensee; or (ii) was lawfully received by Licensee from a third party free of any obligation of confidence to the third party; or (iii) was already in Licensee's possession prior to receipt from Licensor; or (iv) is required to be disclosed in a judicial or administrative proceeding after all reasonable legal remedies for maintaining such information in confidence have been exhausted; or (v) is subsequently and independently developed by Licensee's employees, consultants, or agents without reference to Proprietary Information.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>D.&#9;The Licensor claims and reserves to itself all rights and benefits afforded under U.S. copyright law and all International copyright conventions in the Program and Documentation. Portions of the Program may be covered by applications for patents in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>E.&#9;Licensee may not, at any time, disclose or disseminate all or any part of the Proprietary Information to any third party. Licensee may not "unlock" or "reverse engineer" the code of the Program, as the terms are generally used in the trade. Licensee will ensure that all Licensee's personnel afforded access to the Proprietary Information shall take all reasonable precautions to protect it against improper use, dissemination, or disclosure.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>F.&#9;Licensee acknowledges that, in the event of the Licensee's breach of any of the foregoing provisions, DataLynx, Inc. will not have an adequate remedy in money or damages. DataLynx, Inc. shall therefore be entitled to seek an injunction against such breach from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon such breach. DataLynx, Inc.'s right to obtain injunctive relief shall not limit its right to seek further remedies.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>G.&#9;The Licensee shall devote its best efforts, consistent with the practices and procedures under which it protects its own most valuable proprietary information and materials, to protect the Program and Documentation against any unauthorized or unlawful use or copying.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>H.&#9;The Licensee shall make no hard copies of the Program or associated documentation, and may store Program in memory only as may be necessary for the normal operation of the Program on one CPU for use on one terminal.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>I.&#9;Licensee's obligations hereunder to protect DataLynx, Inc.'s Proprietary Information shall survive the evaluation period and remain in effect for so long as DataLynx, Inc. is entitled to protection of its rights in the Program and Documentation under applicable law.&lt;/P>
    &lt;B>&lt;P>4.&#9;Warranties.&lt;/P>
    &lt;/B>&lt;P>A.&#9;The Licensor warranties that it has the right to enter into this Agreement and fully perform all obligations undertaken in this Agreement.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>B.&#9;The licensor disclaims any and all promises, representations, and warranties, except as expressly set forth in this agreement, with respect to any data, information, or other material furnished to the Licensee hereunder, including their condition; conformity to any representation or description; the existence of any latent or patent defects; and title, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose or use.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>C.&#9;in no event shall the licensor be liable to the licensee for any loss of profits; any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages; or any claims or demands brought against the licensor even if the licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&lt;/P>
    &lt;B>&lt;P>5.&#9;Indemnification.&lt;/P>
    &lt;/B>&lt;P>A.&#9;If a third party claims that the Licensed Program infringes its patent, copyright, or trade secret, or any similar intellectual property right, Licensor will defend Licensee against that claim at Licensor's expense and pay all damages that a court finally awards, provided that Licensee promptly notifies Licensor in writing of the claim, and allows Licensor to control, and cooperate with Licensor in, the defense or any related settlement negotiations. However, Licensor has no obligation for any claim based on Licensee's modification of the Licensed Program or its combination, operation, or use with any product, data, or apparatus not specified or provided by Licensor, provided that such claim solely and necessarily is based on such combination, operation, or use and such claim would be avoided by combination, operation, or use with products, data, or apparatus specified or provided by Licensor. this paragraph states licensor's entire obligation to licensee with respect to any claim of infringement.&lt;/P>
    &lt;B>&lt;P>6.&#9;Miscellaneous.&lt;/P>
    &lt;/B>&lt;P>A.&#9;Licensee may not sell, assign or otherwise transfer any right or obligation hereunder without the prior written consent of DataLynx, Inc.. The Agreement shall be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of California, and shall be effective on the date last written below.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>B.&#9;This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto and supersedes all prior representations, proposals, discussions, and communications, whether oral or in writing. This Agreement may be modified or amended only with the prior written consent of authorized representatives of both parties.&lt;/P>
    &lt;P>C.&#9;If the Program will run on computers located outside the United States, Licensee is responsible for meeting all import requirements for cryptography in the country of operation.&lt;/P>&lt;/DIR>

ááá Title:á Security Vulnerability with rpc.pcnfsd

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
ááá HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY SECURITY BULLETIN: #00091, 08 Febraury 1999
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The information in the following Security Bulletin should be acted upon
    as soon as possible.á Hewlett-Packard Company will not be liable for any
    consequences to any customer resulting from customer's failure to fully
    implement instructions in this Security Bulletin as soon as possible.
    
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PROBLEM:á rpc.pcnfsd has an error in its use of the spool directory
    
    PLATFORM: HP 9000 series 700/800.
    
    DAMAGE:áá Remote and local users can compromise root access.
    
    SOLUTION: Install _all_ applicable patches listed below.á Reboot required.
    
    AVAILABILITY:á All patches are available now.
    
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I.
    áá A. Background
    ááááá rpc.pcnfsd is a remote procedure call used by NFS clients which is
    ááááá a service providing username and password authentication for system
    ááááá which have NFS client software installed.
    ááááá If exploited, this defect allows the main printer spool directory
    ááááá used by rpc.pcnfsd to be made world writeable.
    
    áá B. Fixing the problem
    ááááá This involves installing a series of patches which require
    ááááá rebooting the system.á The main patch requires a libc patch,
    ááááá which in turn requires a kernal patch.
    
    ááááááá For HP-UX 10.01:ááááááááááááááááááááááá PHNE_17248
    ááááááá For HP-UX 10.10:ááááááááááááááááááááááá PHNE_17248

    ááááááá For HP-UX 11.00:ááááááááááááááááááááááá PHNE_16470
    
    ááááá The following sets of patches will need to be installed to resolve
    ááááá all the documented patch dependencies.á The dependencies will be
    ááááá satisfied by the patches listed, or any patch that supersedes them:

    > I am rep. from newdimensions
    
    I'm sorry but I have taken one of the New Dimensions programs
    on computer security and I am glad that I wasn't in the private
    sector paying for this program, I work in a security department 
    of a large American miltary/industrial corporation and I wasn't
    too taken by the instructors, This one asian girl was almost 
    reading off of cue cards it was that bad, She knew as about 
    hacking and securing networks as I did brain surgery, and I 
    was promised in the mailing I got from my boss, Route of 
    Phrack fame and got some hacker I never heard of called se7en?á 
    I was really there to hear Route, and I was *VERY* disappointed! 
    
    
    The study guide was ripped not so cleanly from 'Maxinum Internet 
    Security' and covered topics I would have expected in a course
    teaching 'fresh newbies' to Internet security.á Not the hardended
    program in getting tough with hackers like I was promised. I doubt 
    that most of you would be willing to pay the $1295 for the same 
    course I got, and wasn't too pleased with, I learned more from the 
    others attending the class than from the instructors, You can find 
    better courses from attending BlackHat or Defcon than this.
    
    I should also mention that I have lurked on this list for some 
    time and know that DUECE3815 has a hard enough time forming complete 
    sentences let alone selling all of you on computer security courses,
    But as the Bell helmet company used to advertise a long time ago, 
    You put a $10 helmet on a $10 head.

    FTP PASV "Pizza Thief" Exploit
    Author: Jeffrey R. Gerber
    
    PROBLEM:
    Legitimate FTP clients may experience Denial of Service and rogue FTP
    clients may obtain unauthorized access to data.
    
    PLATFORM:
    All operating systems. All FTP clients and FTP servers affected.
    
    DAMAGE:
    Data loss, data corruption, and denial of service.
    
    SOLUTION:
    Proposed solutions follow at the end of this document.
    
    VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:
    Risk is medium. The ability for this attack to be performed is not
    100% guaranteed. The higher the volume of traffic an FTP server sees,
    the higher the potential for a successful attack. This attack has not
    yet been observed in the wild.
    
    Synopsis:
    The Pizza Thief exploit relies on the FTP Passive (PASV) mode of
    operation. When a client connects to a server using the PASV mode, the
    server opens a port for data transfer to the client. As observed on
    all tested FTP servers, any client other than the legitimate client
    may just as equally connect to the allocated data port. Typical
    behavior is that the first client to connect to the data port gets the
    data. Any following connections from other clients (including the
    legitimate client) will either be rejected or connect without
    reception of data.
    
    Description:
    RFC 765 "FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL", Page 23 describes the "TRANSFER
    PARAMETER COMMANDS" for FTP. Two named transfer parameter commands are
    DATA PORT (PORT) and PASSIVE (PASV). Either PORT or PASV is used by
    FTP to establish a data connection, the Data Transfer Process (DTP).
    FTP data connections are frequently followed by the RETRIEVE (RETR),
    STORE (STOR), APPEND (with create) (APPE), and LIST (LIST) commands
    which use the DTP.
    
    When a DTP connection is established between an FTP client and an FTP
    server, either the server listens for a connection from the client
    (PASV command) or the client listens for a connection from the server
    (PORT command).
    
    If a PORT command is issued to the server, the server requires the
    client to state at which network address and on which port the server
    is to connect to the client. The PORT command is of the format: "PORT
    h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2" where h1,h2,h3,h4 is the client's network address,
    and p1,p2 is the 16 bit client port number in an 8 bit high,low bit
    order. If a PASV command is issued to the server, the server responds
    to the client, telling the client at what network address and on what
    port the client is to connect to the server. The PASV command takes no
    parameters.
    
    The "Postel's Pizza Parlor" FTP analogy:
    
    Mr. Postel runs a fine pizza parlor in Anytown, CA. In recent years
    Mr. Postel added two new services to his business: "Carry Out" and
    "Delivery". Customers thoroughly enjoy both services.
    
    Some customers living in gated communities, a recent housing
    phenomenon that has been continually expanding, have found it
    necessary to use Carry Out rather than Delivery since the delivery
    
person frequently has problems getting through the front gate.
    Although the gated community customers find carry out a bit of a pain
    they enjoy the compromise for their higher level of security in living.
    
    Mr. Postel's business ran fine for a while but he soon noticed two
    erroneous phenomenon: 1) Some Delivery pizza's were being delivered to
    the wrong addresses. 2) Some Carry Out customers were arguing that
    their pizza wasn't ready when they arrived. After carefully looking
    into the Delivery issue, Mr. Postel discovered that some customers
    were calling and having pizza's delivered to wrong addresses or to
    individuals that didn't order a pizza. Mr. Postel surmised that either
    the caller was doing this as a prank or they were, for whatever
    strange reasons, making notes of where the pizzas were able to be
    delivered and not delivered. After looking into the Carry Out problem,
    Mr. Postel determined that "pizza thieves" were comming into the store
    and asking to pick up pizzas that were not their own by guessing
    likely order numbers (the method by which a customer asks for his or
    her pizza). The legitimate customers were then arriving only to find
    that their pizza wasn't ready.
    
    After careful thought on the Carry Out problem, Mr. Postel decided to
    make it a policy for the calling customers to state their home
    address. Now when the customer comes into the pizza parlor, the server
    will check the person's drivers license for a matching address. The
    Carry Out problem analogously describes the problem with the current
    FTP PASV connection methodology. Presently, most if not all, FTP
    servers on the Internet are succeptible to a "pizza thief" attack.
    This attack involves a rogue client making educated guesses at
    potential port numbers (pizza order numbers). Port number prediction
    is possible by repetitive sampling of server responses from the PASV
    command. Many servers allocate new port numbers by allocating a new
    port number at a value one higher than the last used port number. This
    is analogous to a pizza thief sitting in a waiting room, listening to
    previous order numbers and then guessing at a currently pending order
    number and asking for it.
    
    In the past, the PASV connection method was used with far less
    frequency than the preferred PORT connection method. The use of PASV
    has been increasing proportionately with an increased frequency of
    clients sitting behind firewalls (gated communities). The pizza thief
    attack thus becomes more effective by day.
    
    Recommendations:
    Solving the problem requires careful thought. Server programmers can
    program a server to identify the client address associated with the
    control port and only allow data port connections from the client
    address, however this server would not be RFC compliant.
    
    In the FTP standard, server to server connections are possible by use
    of the PORT command on server A and the PASV command on server B. The
    client directs both server A and B to connect to each other. In this
    case, assume that server A accepts the PASV command. Server A will
    find that the address of the client on the control port does not match
    the address associated with the data connection (which is server B's
    
address).
    
    A possible solution is an RFC obsoletion or update, documenting a new
    form of the PASV command, PASX for "PASsiVe eXtended". The PASX
    command would take address arguments in the form h1,h2,h3,h4 just as
    the PORT command uses, sans port numbers p1,p2. In using PASX, both
    the client to server connections and the server to server connections
    would remain compliant with current RFC methodologies, yet adding a
    much needed layer of authentication.
    
    RFC 2228 "FTP SECURITY EXTENSIONS" has addressed the issue of securing
    the data channel with the DATA CHANNEL PROTECTION LEVEL (PROT)
    extension and use of data encapsulation. Through the use of a secured
    data channel, the Pizza Thief threat is reduced to a simple denial of
    service attack.

    Subject: TROJAN: netstation.navio-comm.rte 1.1.0.1
    
      While configuring some IBM Network Station 300s I noticed that my /tmp
    directory had become NFS exported and world read/writeable!!  I traced
    this to one of the configuration scripts that is included in AIX's
    netstation.navio-com.rte 1.1.0.1 used for the Navio NC browser.
    
    >From /usr/netstation/bin/Xnav:
    
    1)  Magic number is munged ... pet peeve of mine:
    
        +1  # @(#)93  1.3 src/nav/aix/Xnav.cpp, navio, 41navio110
        +2  #!/bin/ksh
        +3  #
        ...
    
    2)  This part is somewhat problematic:
    
       ...
       +98  grep "/tmp" /etc/exports > /dev/null 2>&1
       +99  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      +100          echo "/tmp" >> /etc/exports
      +101          /usr/sbin/exportfs -a
      +102  fi
       ...
    
    The fix:
    
    1) Do you have netstation.navio.comm-rte installed?
    
      # lslpp -l netstation.navio-comm-rte
    
    2)  Check if /tmp is exported with:
    
      # exportfs
    
    3) If /tmp is exported run:
    
      # /usr/sbin/rmnfsexp -d /tmp -B
    
    This emphasizes the importance of running a regular "sanity" security
    audits such as satan or ISS.

    /proc 3 way smp race condition in Linux 2.2.1 kernel

    Subject: [patch] /proc race fixes for 2.2.1 (fwd)
    
    This is a short analysis I've done yesterday about the array.c
    (/proc/pid/...) races of Linux-2.2.0 and Linux-2.2.1. These races was
    leading to very easily reproducible crashes and Oopses in linux-2.2.0. But
    Linux-2.2.1 is not been completly fixed. There's still a potential race
    very hard to reproduce (I think you need at least a 3way smp). You can
    find a kind of /proc sniffer in this email. At the end of this email
    you'll find my complete fix for 2.2.1.
    
    The race if exploited can lead at least to reading data from random used
    memory. The memory that could be sniffed could contain any kind of useful
    data (userspace process memory, cache or whatever). It's not possible to
    grab the whole page but it's possible only to reproduce the contents of
    the memory reading and decoding the output of /proc.
    
    Maybe it's impossible to exploit the SMP race I am pointing out even if on
    3way smp because of timing issues, but there's no a lock that assures
    atomicity.
    
    Side note: I hope to have diffed all the interesting changes from my tree
    to 2.2.1 at the end of the email (I don't have the time to check). If for
    some reason the patch won't apply cleanly or will not work don't bother me
    in mass, but instead go in sync with my personal kernel tree to get this
    race fixed (I take it open just to allow other people to try it) at
    ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.1_arca-2.gz. My tree has also
    many other improvements, bugfix and features (not only developed by me,
    e.g.  the ieee1284-parport code developed by Tim Waugth) and can have any
    kind of bugs in it so ask me before use it for production (so I'll tell
    you what you have to remove to get it rock solid for sure).

    To: linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu
    Subject: [patch] /proc race fixes for 2.2.1
    
    2.2.1 reintroduced a SMP race in array.c. The SMP race is that wait(2) can
    free the kernel stack of the zombie process while array.c is using it.
    
    Once the page is freed it can be reused, and if it get recycled before
    array.c has finished to use it, you could reconstruct part of RAM that you
    should not be allowed to read (looking at /proc data) and array.c could
    get in problems during its lifetime (not checked this last but it's a
    guess).
    
    In practice the window for the race is small and I think you would need at
    least 3 CPU to reproduce this I think.
    
    The first CPU has to fork a process that will do only an _exit(2). Then
    has to wait that the forked process become a zombie, and once it's a
    zombie it has to start a /proc sniffer that will read /proc/zombiepid/stat
    on the other cpu.
    
    This sniffer will save its contents to a buffer at the first pass and then
    it will start reading /proc/../stat in loop and comparing it with the one
    saved in the buffer, and it will then log the output of /proc/../stat if
    it will be changed compared with the saved data sample in the buffer.
    
    Once the sniffer is at regime (the loop that search for /proc changes is
    started) the task on the first CPU (the one that forked the sniffer) has
    to do a wait(2) so that the stack of the zombie process will be released.
    
    A bit before doing the wait(2) you must eat all the memory avaliable with
    a trashing proggy and this last has to run in a new CPU (so you need at
    least a 3way smp). Since this last memory-trasher proggy will start
    allocing tons of memory, you'll have a chance that the pages freed by
    wait(2) will be realloced by the kernel before the read of the /proc
    sniffer will finish.
    
    It's theorically possible to sniff data from the kernel exploiting the
    /proc race but it's really hard and only on some very parallel hardware.
    
    I also written a sample of exploit (really ugly, I written it very fast
    and without thinking too much about it because I think to spend better my
    time in fixing the bug or writing useful code than in writing exploits....
    and because I realizied that on the hardware I have here it would have
    never worked ;).

    Probably it has also bugs (since I have no chance to make it working here
    I am not going to look at it further), I attached it here only in the case
    someone is interested on a exploit sample. BTW, is there a better way to
    know when the child is become a zombie than reading
    /proc/pidofchild/status ? I thought to catch the SIGCHILD signal but as
    first I was not sure that this way a wait() would be wakenup anyway (too
    lazy to check in signal.c ;), and as second with the /proc/xxx/status
    approch I had to write less code anyway and since it was a not performance
    critical piece of code I had no dubit of the way to take ;).
    
    I also understood very well the reason of the 2.2.0 oopses and process in
    D state. It was happening something like this:

                                            tsk->mm = mm_alloc(); (mm->count = 1)
                                            finish execve...
                                            .... everything he wants ....
            now `ps` get rescheduled
            and own the mm->semaphore
            (of a mm_struct that is not
            tsk->mm anymore)
            release_task(tsk);
            mmput(tsk->mm); (but mm->count was 1!!)
            exit_mmap();
            zap_page_range() /* aieee! */
                                            at the first fault it will get
                                            a mm = &init_mm !!
    
    Thinks like this can't happens in 2.2.0-pre9 just because tsk->mm was
    still referencing the old mm of the process (before the execve) because
    tsk->mm was a copy and not a runtime value.
    
    Obviously there was the stack overflow and performances problem in the
    (1) copy approch.
    
    So now I fixed all races with a zerocopy approch (originally suggested by
    Linus that increments the page count of the process stack instead of
    doing the copy, but it also assure that array.c always use the mm it has
    get before (with mmget())).
    
    Works fine here. Patch against 2.2.1:

    The Jammer does monitor ALL UDP traffic on your computer, so you can sleep
    well & have all passwords of miserable hackers.
    
    When the Jammer program gets the BO request packet it starts the decryption
    process & generates the workable password of BO server. At the end of
    decryption the program puts the password string into the readable file on
    your hard disk & sends the warring massage toward the source about the
    Jammer protection.
    
    The Jammer works with low level network driver & always communicates with
    Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS), unlike Nuke Nabber, NoBo and
    BOFreeze (they use the higher level such as Winsock).

    The well know and dangerous MacOS worm AutoStart is capable of installing
    itself on Windows NT Server MacVolumes. If you have a "Deldb" file on the
    root of that volume you should have that worm.
    
    The worm is not visible to any Wintel anti-virus software, but the virus

    Israeli schoolboy destroys Iraqi internet site
    TEL AVIV, Jan 31 (AFP) - A 14-year-old Israeli computer nut has
    penetrated and destroyed an Iraqi government site on the internet, the
    daily Yediot Aharonot reported Sunday.
    
    "I read about the site in a computer magazine, and it bugged me," Nir
    Zigdon told the paper. "I thought that if Israel is afraid to eliminate
    (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein, I could at least destroy his computer
    sites."
    
    He said he got into the site by persuading its manager that he was a
    young Palestinianwho had developed a programme for wiping Israeli sites.
    
    "It convinced them, and then I was able to destroy it," he said.
    
    The next day Zigdon received a "furious" email signed by the site
    manager, which he printed out and pinned proudly to his wall. Zigdon has
    been computer crazy since he was four, helped by his father, a teacher
    and consultant for a high-tech company.

       I have a feeling cost plays a role in this.  The cost to hunt down a 
      couple punk kids who know how to tumble neumber will far outweigh what it 
       costs them to just forget about it.  The same kind of thing tends to 
       happen when you tell people that thier box has been hacked and is being 
       used to spam the shit out of you.  At the most, they will re-install the 
       OS and that is that.  When they get hacked again next week they will do 
       it all over again, becuase taking the time to go and find the peopel 
       responsible is just too dificult and costly for them.

            I would tend to agree with your assessment.  I forget who said it
    first, but one truly has to be a little insane to seek justice.  The
    example used was a stolen briefcase worth $50.  One would have to shell
    out at least $1500 in court costs and lawyer fees just to get some justice
    out of the whole mess, so most folks would logically just write off the loss.
    
            I guess you could say that the number of laws of a nation is
    directly inverse to the amount of justice the average person gets.

            Hello,
    
            for about a two months ago I make few changes in IPX stack related
    to broadcast bug, internal net support and little bug in SPX
    implementation. As they work stable I suggest them to discuss and commit
    in to source tree. Here is a short explanation:
    
            Broadcasts: local host never get broadcast packet originated by
    itself. Novell implementation do that, and this simplify programming.
    
            Internal net: it is possible to implement internal net conception
    like used in Netware servers by configure loopback interface as follows:
            ifconfig lo0 ipx 0x5a5a.1
    
            After that, server programs like mars_nwe , can use only 
    network 0x5a5a and host 1. Of course this requires small changes to ipx
    stack and IPXrouted.
    
            SPX bug are just invalid order of operators :)
    
            All patches are simple and attached at the end of letter.
    
            BTW, I mostly finish work on Netware client (typical throughput
    about 730Kb/s on 10Mbit network). Higher rates is possible with packet
    burst mode, so does any body know the details ?

    Yup.  I haven't looked into the issue with these particular servers,
    but Apache on Win32 used to be impacted by this same issue until it
    was fixed in 1.3.1.
    
    I think we have run into a half dozen different special case situations in
    Apache where "magic" filenames needed to be dealt with specially under 95
    and/or NT to avoid security holes.
    
    You have to deal with:
    
            - case sensitivity
            - short filenames
            - trailing "."s on filenames
            - three or more "."s
            - special filenames (eg. "aux")
    
    Those are all the "multiple names for one file" or "magic file name"
    issues I can think of right now; I am sure there are more that I can't
    think of and that I don't know about.  At various times, various Win32 web
    servers have been vulnerable to the above issues.  Unfortunately, trying
    to find a canonical list of the ways that filename variance can occur in
    Windows is difficult, and it is obvious that Microsoft doesn't have it
    down either, based on the fact that many of these bugs have appeared in
    IIS in the past as well.
    
    These issues also can appear differently depending on if you are using
    95/98/NT3.5/NT4 and depending on what filesystem you are using, so testing
    for them isn't as simple as you would hope.
    
    It really makes me wish for a nice young system, one that didn't have time
    to get all this accumulated cruft.  Oh.  Wait.  Unix is a crufty old
    system and even it doesn't have this particular cruft.  In this particular
    area, Windows gets a heck of a lot of thumbs down.

    I've been asked by our t-com and infrastructure guys to post a question as
    to the value of physical port restrictions being placed on their hubs and
    switches.  We are currently using these features in some places on our LAN,
    but they often get in the way.  Here's how it works if you're per chance not
    familiar.  As each new machine comes on line the hub or switch 'learns' the
    MAC address of that machine and then sets a variable to allow no other MAC
    address to speak to that physical port.  The hubs and switches come with an
    administration application that allows you to reset / disable / or enable
    any particular port one at a time or all the ports at once on a particular
    device.  The idea is to keep anyone from 'stealing' a port on the LAN and
    listening in on what is going on on the wire. (i.e. - help protect physical
    access to the wire.)
    
    Is any body out there using these sort of tools?  Where do you use them?
    Are they worth the trouble to you? etc. etc. ...
    
    
    Thanx,
    Eric, II

     Simply send Big Udp Packets to eg. Port 31337 and Mr. Nobo  will see a 
     Big error message at each Packet!!!
    
    As Default Nobo only Logs on screen and not into file that means you can
    erase your Ping!! I tested this on NT and W95 and after some time it will
    kill with a Overflow.

  9.0  Off The Hook Off The Air?
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       HNN Http://www.hackernews.com/ February 7th 1999
       contributed by Anonymous 

      'Off the Hook' the hacker radio program broadcast by WBAI
       99.5FM in New York, and by real audio over the Internet may
       soon go silent. Pacifica Radio, the largest and most powerful
       public radio broadcaster, holds the broadcast licenses of WBAI
       99.5FM in New York, as well as other stations across the
       country. Pacifica Radio, will vote on the weekend of February
       26-28 to alter the by-laws of the foundation regarding who, in the
       future, will select the Pacifica board of governors. This will
       possibly give itself, for the first time, majority control over its own
       composition and will give board members the total, permanent
       control of Pacifica and its 300 million dollars worth of assets.
       This action as well as recent movements by Pacifica to take the
       organization private has lead some to believe that 'Off the Hook'
       may be in jeopardy of of being thrown off the air.

       Opic, a member of The CodeBreakers has written a new MS
       Word macro virus known as Caligula that specifically targets
       PGP private keys. Once you have been infected the viruses looks
       for your private key ring and uploads it to a Codebreakers FTP
       site. NAI, the owners of PGP claim that this in no way weakens
       the security of PGP. (So who do you believe? The good guys or
       the bad guys? Which is which?)

      UPT, 10 years of hacker culture
      Unphamiliar Territory, often referred to as UPT or UPT.ORG, was one of the longest running *underground* computer bulletin boards of all time. Like
      all good things, it had to end sometime. Because of the influence that it had on the computer underground during the time it was up, we are working on a
      new project to show the new generation of hackers, security professionals and interested geeks just what we were. 
      
      HISTORY OF UPT
      Cut to 1988. A geeky kid named Tom Jackiewicz was sitting in front of his computer, an old 8088 clone. To get the most performance out of this box, he spent
      hours upon hours trying to modify his CONFIG.SYS file under DOS 3.3 to fully take advantage of this computing power. Sure, it wasn't the greatest box in the
      world, but it effectively let him run King's Quest II. I don't know exactly how it happened, but this kid, going by the nick of Invalid Media, or iNVALiD MEDiA to
      be more accurate, decided that running a bulletin board would be a cool experience.
      
      Up springs Phortress Systems IV, a bulletin board running part time at 1200 baud off of his parent's phone line. The software? I can't really remember that far back
      but I know we tried PC Board v10 (the only version I could find that was available in the public domain), Spitfire, WWIV 4.12 (probably the most popular package
      back then), Telegard, TAG, LSD, Celerity, and a few others I'm sure I don't remember. I guess this was back in the day when you used to be able to login to the
      THG or INC bbses and they would have the latest cool BBS software cracked under 30: 0-day BBS software d00d . I would be the guy using up the phone lines
      for hours at a time downloading the software at 1200 baud.
      
      For the first few years, Phortress Systems IV was a fun little active BBS. We eventually settled on using WWIV as our BBS software of choice. I mean, with all the
      kids creating cool mods for it in C and making them available on their BBSes, it was definetely cool.
      
      Luther, the sysop of The Phortress, gave us a call one night and told us that we would have to change the name. A shitty little system like PSIV would *not* be
      associated with a great BBS like The Phortress. So Unphamiliar Territory was quickly pulled out of my ass and the abbreviations of UNPHAM and UPT were
      quickly born. I never heard much else about 'The great Phortress System' that we weren't cool enough to be mistaken for.
      
      So here we are. Running a BBS off of a 21.4mb hard drive and a 1200 baud Prometheus modem. Our userbase? Names you might have heard of would be Mind
      Rape from the National Security Anarchists, Quinton J. Miranda from Phortune 500, and a few other random people who were interested in taking a look at 602's
      hacker scene (or lack of a hacker scene).
      
      Posts in the telco section usually resulted in someone looking up the acronym in question and throwing the definition into the next post. Or people bragging about all
      the things they broke into by logging in as 'root', discussions on what k0d3z could be used to dial up the other BBSes around at that time. But hey, it was a start.
      
      Around 1991 was when the BBS really became active. By this time we had settled on using a BBS software called 'Paragon' with built-in QWK support. The
      Attitude Adjuster was very happy about this because he could dial in, download all our messages, respond to EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM offline, call up 2
      days later and post them all. It was common for his QWK packets to be upwards of 250 messages. Quite scary, but hey, it created a lot of activty.
      Oh. I guess we were NuKE site around this time. I'm sure we were 'distro' sites for other places as well, but NuKE was always a big deal. The Canadian virus
      group was quite popular for many years to come and it was a sign that our BBS was one of the top 50 or so that they came across. With the normal life-span of a
      BBS being 6 to 9 months, we were considered old after being up for more than 2 years.
      
      I guess by this time we represented the National Security Anarchists. An elite group of 602 hackers consisting of Mind Rape, Mercury, The Dark Druid, Angel of
      Death, myself, and a few others. Crusader was NSA's official transportation as we were all either too young or too broke to have our own. This worked out nicely
      except for the fact that Crusader ended up keeping all the things we found trashing in the back of his house -- and we never saw them again. Oh well. The rewards
      of having a car and driving around a bunch of kids. 
      
      Ties with NuKE were broken and we joined Phalcon/Skism. Unnamed members of Phalcon/Skism called us up on the phone one day and said "Dude, your board
      fucking rocks. You *need* to ditch NuKE and join us". So we did. 
      
      By this time we had gained a very good reputation with the computer underground. Mercury was highly regarded as a great source of information and was always
      online posting new security tips, random tools he found on the internet, and very well thought out responses to everyone's questions. A lot of other people such as
      Attitude Adjuster, Accidental Tourist, Quinton J. Miranda, Mind Rape, cllisk8r, Toxic Phreak, Night Ranger (of the old VMB scene), a handful of Phalcon/Skism,
      NuKE and other virus group members, kept on posting as well. Jeager from Missouri was always on UPT and all over the X.25 networks finding out so many cool
      places to run around and establishing new chat systems. Random people from Lutzifer and QSD, places we all frequented, showed their faces on UPT. We were
      seen as of somewhat of a rock at that point in time.
      
      We weren't the best board out there but we were quickly making it up there with the ranks of Pentavia, Phalcon/Skism's LANDFILL, Midian, West Coast
      Technology and maybe a small group of others. We had a great userbase and a sysop who "ate, slept and drank UPT".. who was always on the lookout for new
      users to add to the system and new topics he could being up in the message bases.
      
      Every morning I would wake up to new threads on every topic imaginable and a score of people overseas posting the latest codes at 5:31am my time. Thinngs were
      going great.
      
      1992 was a strange year that really put UPT over the edge. MICROWIRE had died. MICROWIRE was the NUI that everyone used to hop to everyone's favorite
      chat sites Lutzifer and QSD. What were people to do? Where were they going to go? They came here. So not only was the entire VMB and phreak scene fully
      represented on UPT, but so were all those who used MICROWIRE and never figured out a way to get on without it. This would be the year that UPT would be
      considered one of the best hacker BBSes of all time.
      
      Who knows what year it was, but Paragon development stopped and I lost contact with everyone working on it. As time went on and we needed more features
      added, we were just out of luck. We tried running Celerity for a while but it just didn't work out too well. We ended up going to Waffle. Then Waffle under SLS
      Linux. The only other time UPT was running unix was when Garbled User tried converting us to NetBSD back during the summer of 1992. That was a pain in the
      ass, topped off by MADMAN doing !sh at the [more] prompt of the BBS software we attempted to run and dropping to a root shell. 
      
      Cut in to 1994. invalid and merc are working for days straight converting a 486/33 with 16 megabytes of RAM and a 209mb hard drive to SLS Linux. After
      multiple mistakes and errors in our lilo configurations. The kernel. Oh, yeah, 0.97. You know, the kernel where "The IRQ code has solidified, and should work on all
      machines. Not all of the SCSI drivers use it yet, so I expect patches for that". The same kernel where "include-files have been moved around some more: there are
      still some names that clash with the standard headers, but not many". Yeah, this is the same Linux that every kid in the world is now running and convincing their
      companies is the most stable piece of code in the world. Oh yeah, and this is the kernel where "while (1) fork();" won't kill the machine for non-root users". *sigh*.
      
      We eventually stabilized on kernel 1.1.59 -- finally getting past the 0 beta kernels. We were quite happy. A new era for UPT had started. During the unix upgrade
      we converted all the old message bases and userbase to Waffle.
      
      After probably 3 straight days of configuring the machine, 'iceman' logged onto our boxes and spent what seemed like eternity online trying to break root on our
      machines. He succeeded, being the first person to ever break root on our boxes. He used 'sendmail'. We were quite annoyed that we didn't take the time to secure
      but happy that 'iceman' was cool enough to let us know where our security holes were.
      
      I guess this is around the time that we started sitting at Denny's 24 hours a day going over ways we could make UPT more secure and unique. We came up with
      many ideas which we implemented and many that ended up making it into current issues of Phrack (years after we implemented them on UPT).
      
      Our brainstorming sessions come up with some of the following ideas:
        .hushutmp/.hushwtmp files could be created in your home directory to hide you from utmp/wtmp. this way, you could connect from sites that would
      identify you (i.e. your work) without the fear the other UPT users could gain knowledge of your identity. 
        trusted path execution. this has been discussed many times since we first implemented it so i'm sure you've read about it somewhere. the idea is that the
      directory needs to be owned by root and have certain permissions (i.e. not group writable) or else you can't execute files out of that directory. for
      example, you can't execute files you compile on our system our of your home directory. 
        socks group. you had to be in the group 'socks' in order to open up a socket on our system. To be finished later.. 
      
      THE SYSOPS
      Tom Jackiewicz, aka Invalid Media, invalid.
      invalid founded UPT and helped make it the board that it ended up being. He is currently working as a consultant in Silicon Valley in the field of system scalability
      (specifically related to LDAP and SMTP).
      
      Mercury or merc of the National Security Anarchists.
      merc no longer exists. However, for the years he was on the system, he was always a great source of knowledge and did most of the programming related to
      running the BBS.
      
      Mind Rape of the National Security Anarchists.
      While not one of the official sysops, he was a mentor to those who knew him. He's still crazy.
      
      Warlock Bones or wbones.
      When the system was moved from invalid's house, he took over. This was sometime in 1992. It stayed at his house for quite some time running on a Dual Standard
      modem (a nice step up) and a fast 386 machine.
      
      Garbled User or garbled of Freakers Bureau Incorporated.
      Upon moving to Phoenix, he made UPT the head BBS of FBI. All of the articles for FBI were published there. The system was actually at his house for the summer
      of 1993 (if I remember correctly).
      
      Many people have also helped over the years in keeping the system up and donating new hardware. Professor Falken from the old LOD gave us our first high speed
      modem (ZOOM v32), Pluvius from BoW gave us our first router (an old NTI). Many people have donated time, energy, programming talent, and insane amounts
      of alcohol that kept us alive for more than a decade. 
      
      THE GROUPS
      We've been associated with many groups over the past few years. Starting out with the 504 crowd and NCC/GCA with Dr. C, Ratfink, and various others. Then on
      to being the head board for the National Security Anarchists with Mercury, Mind Rape, The Dark Druid, Angel of Death, and many others. NuKE with Rock
      Steady and the other canucks. The most influential at the time was Phalcon/Skism with GarbageHeap, Orion Rogue, HellRaiser, CRoWMeiSTeR and others. The
      text file groups all wanted us to be distribution sites for them. Digital Free Press, uXu, Freedom, and many others.
      
      And not to forget the most fun product of UPT -- Cult of the Dead Cat, along with The Attitude Adjuster (under a handful of nicks) and Mahatma Mcaf33 (me!).
      The group was initially started as an anti-cDc group because Drunkfux complained that we had the dead cow logo upon logging in. So instantly we changed the logo
      to a dead cat and insulted everyone within our publications. Check out some of the CdC archives on eff.org. *sigh*. Those were the days. 
      
      MESSAGE ARCHIVES
      The message archives have actually been converted. Message bases date as far back as 02/1992. More are still on tape and need to be restored. We are working
      on the process right now.
      
      In the days of Warez BBSes going HST only, The Humble Guys, Phun Line out of Sacramento, and West Coast Technologies, BBSes were king. And the BBS
      sysops were masters of all information. UPT was glad to be a part of that era of hacker culture. While messages won't be as interesting now as they were back then,
      its still nice to look back at some of the old posts that we had on the box. And its fun to look at your coworker in the next office over and say, "You posted
      THAT?". You know who you are.
