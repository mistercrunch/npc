        For many, faith is a suitable substitute for knowledge,
                   as death is for a difficult life. 
            
     
        
  
   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

 00.1 CONTACT INFORMATION AND MAIL DROP
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Wahoo, we now have a mail-drop, if you are outside of the U.S.A or
    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.

    Send all goodies to:

	    HWA NEWS
	    P.O BOX 44118
	    370 MAIN ST. NORTH
	    BRAMPTON, ONTARIO
	    CANADA
	    L6V 4H5

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

    Remember: YOYOW.

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on this list and that reproduction of
    those words without your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be challenged by you, the author.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                             
      
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour &lt;sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

    EoC    - End of Commentary

    EoA    - End of Article or more commonly @HWA

    EoF    - End of file

    EoD    - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN &lt;g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper
             noun means the hackernews site proper. k? k. ;&

 03.0 So you wanna be a hacker? by Avatar
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      retro-text picked up off the web by - ed ...
      
     http://dmatrix.teamshadow.com/hack/statemind.txt

     So you wanna be a HACKER huh? &lt;Bwahahaha!> It's a state-of-MIND!
     ..you can induce it - but only if you are willing to drive yourself
     mad enough! Go read and practice until you have mastered at least
     Assembly language and Intermediate Level Electronics! Without this
     foundation you'll be just another little geek, who might know the magic
     words to the spell but dosent understand what he's doing! So RTFM!
     ..so what does that mean? Read The Fucking Manual! You will be sooo
     amazed at how easy most things are if you just try to read the manual
     first! The truth is: Most people cant read. Or they read poorly if
     they read at all. So if you can't really read...STOP RIGHT HERE. GO
     learn to read first. If you can't read at a minimum 12th Grade level
     you cant be a hacker. Reading is the basic skill you must have to do
     EVERYTHING BEYOND THIS POINT.
     
      Tell your friends you cant party...you're busy. Spend at least 4
     hours a day at your new-found fascination...or decide right here
     and now that you cant cut it! If you CAN, get a copy of MINIX or
     LINUX...start learning about OPERATING SYSTEMS. Then start your
     1st real hack...try building a computer-controlled, DTMF dialer
     card for your cheap PC...write the code to use it with, make it
     a TSR to keep life interesting...now port it to MINIX or whatever
     ...better yet, port it as an IOCTL call at kernel level! You keep
     reading...
     
      Now you're ready to take on something more complex - go to the
     Library, start a literature search; topic: Telephone Technologies.
     RTFM! Learm about the ancient cross-bar, the Pre-ESS systems, the
     fab MFTSS, the TELEX boxes and circuits...keep reading...buy up
     an older, cheap (like under $50) cellular phone...by this time
     you should already have a subscription to 'Nuts & Volts" as well
     as a few other grassroots technology pubs....buy a copy of the
     "Cellular Hacker's Bible"....start by doing something simple..
     ..disassemble and re-write the phone`s control ROM to allow it
     to function as an 800MHZ scanner...hopefully you've assembled
     a large array of tools and test gear by now. You've got a good
     dual-trace scope, some pc-based PROM burner, a signal generator,
     a logic probe or two, maybe even a microprocessor-emulator for
     the 5051, the Z80, the 68010 or something....you may have been
     dragged into some fields-afar by life - incorporate them: If
     somebody drasgged you into SCUBA, build your own sonar. If you
     have gotten interested in amateur radio, you can build a lot
     of swell stuff...I recommend you checkout Packet's AX25A level2
     protocol...very slick stuff! If your bud's are all into motors,
     take a whak at doing your own Performance PROMS for GM's F.I. and
     spark advance curves...or try adapting some Volkswagen/BOSCHE
     Kjetronics F.I. to a Harley Davidson!..maybe you're into music
     so you buy a synthesizer and learn all about electronic music,
     you start hacking analog modules and build a nicer synth than you
     could buy! Then you interface it to a MIDI port on a cheap 286AT
     and then hack up some sequencer software, or buy some and then
     disassemble it to fix all the bugs! You keep reading...
     
      By now most of your friends are also "far into the pudding", you
     have either gained 50 lbs or gone totally skinny...your skin tone
     is 2 shades lighter from being indoors so long...most of the opposite
     sex is either totally freaked by or with you - they either dig you,
     or they dont!...you're probably knocking on the door of what will
     be a $60K+/yr job as a systems analyst...and you are well-aware that
     90% of the people in this world can't talk their way out of a badly
     cooked steak at the local eatery, let alone install a new motherboard
     in their PC! So you pick up some extra cash on doing shit like that
     for the straights...you keep reading, and RTFM'ing higher and higher,
     learning about networks...the VCR breaks down and your SO bitches
     about having to wait till monday to have it fixed...you fix it in
     about 40 minutes....the next day the clothes dryer starts to make
     squeeking noises like a 50' mouse, you've never fixed one before -
     but somehow it's not that difficult to open the bastard up and find
     the squeek and fix it...and suddenly it dawns on you that hacking
     code or hardware is pretty much the same! You keep reading...
     
      Congrats, you are now a real hacker. Absolutly nothing but a lack of
     time (or in some cases money) can stop you. You are a true Technologic
     Philosopher...you can function in places a mere Engineer or Scientist
     would truly FEAR TO TREAD! You can read better than Evelyn Wood, you
     have a collection of tools that would make a Master Machinist and a
     Prototype EE or ME cry. You can calculate series and parallel resonant
     circuits in your head. You can fix any consumer appliance - if you can
     get the parts. Your car has either become one of your main hacks or
     you'ver deligated the job to a mechanic who you have found to be a
     fellow hacker; and you work on his homebrew 68010 unix box...because
     you've got a 68010 emulator and he works on your car because that's
     the kind he specializes in! Maybe you trade services with people
     for 50% of what ordinary people have to BUY WITH CASH!...you keep
     reading...
     
      (this is the stage where the author now finds himself...16 years
       into a career at a Fortune 5 company and age 42...still reading...
       your mileage may vary! <-((that's my code too! I co-wrote VEEP,

     Summary
     
     ======
     
     Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in Microsoft« Exchange« Server. The vulnerability could allow an attacker
     to perform mail relaying via an Exchange server that is configured to act as a gateway for other Exchange sites using the Internet Messaging
     Service.
     
     Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be
     
     found at http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/MS99-027faq.asp
     
     Issue
     
     ====
     
     Exchange Server implements features designed to defeat "mail relaying", a practice in which an attacker causes an e-mail server to forward mail
     from the attacker, as though the server were the sender of the mail. However, a vulnerability exists in this feature, and could allow an attacker to
     circumvent the anti-relaying features in an Internet-connected Exchange Server.
     
     The vulnerability lies in the way that site-to-site relaying is performed via SMTP. Encapsulated SMTP addresses could be used to send mail to
     any desired e-mail address. The patch eliminates the vulnerability by making encapsulated SMTP addresses subject to the same anti-relay
     protections as non-encapsulated SMTP addresses.

     Disrupting Net access a cybercrime?
     By Robert Lemos, ZDNN
     August 6, 1999 3:28 PM PT
     URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2310624,00.html
     
     A former system administrator of the University of Oklahoma has been charged under the state's
     computer-crime statutes with slowing the university's network to a crawl.
     
     Ryan Breding, 25, faces a single count of disrupting the university's Internet service in 1997, when
     hoards of incoming students downloaded pirated software from servers that he had allegedly set
     up on the university's network. 
     
     "There were times when the authorized users -- students -- were not able to access the Internet at
     all," said Scott Palk, first assistant attorney general for Oklahoma's Cleveland County District
     Attorney's Office.
     
     Known as warez (pronounced "wares"), the software is identical to store-bought versions and
     includes serial numbers to spoof the copy protection mechanisms. The downloads overloaded the
     network, and many students were denied access.
     
     Getting up to speed
     While distributing such software is illegal, the district attorney's office has only charged Breding
     with interfering with network operation. On that charge alone, the former employee faces up to 10
     years in the state penitentiary and up to $100,000 in fines.
     
     The Oklahoma Computer Crimes Act of 1984 makes it a felony to "willfully and without
     authorization disrupt or cause the disruption of computer services or deny or cause the denial of
     access or other computer services to an authorized user of a computer, computer system or
     computer network."
     
     An initial lack of familiarity with computer crimes stymied the investigation. State investigators and
     prosecutors needed to learn how to pursue digital criminals and examine the evidence. 
     
     "These are new crimes -- at least locally," said Palk. "Some people had to undergo training to look
     into it." 
     
     Palk stressed that, for the investigators, the case was a necessary learning experience. "This may
     be a hallmark of things to come," he said. "And we need to be ready."
     
     University officials would not comment for this story. A preliminary hearing is set to start on Aug.

     Mitnick Gets Birthday Present from LA DA - Federal Sentencing Set For Today 


      contributed by evenprime and turtlex 
      The Los Angels District Attorney has given Kevin a
      surprise but welcome birthday present by dropping the
      state charges against him. Last Friday, Kevin's fifth
      birthday behind bars, the LA DA claimed that the
      six-year old case had been mischarged. Kevin had been
      charged with one count of illegally accessing a
      Department of Motor Vehicles computer and retrieving
      confidential information. (Which means he (or someone
      else) tricked a DMV employee over the phone into
      faxing him information) This action clears the way for
      Kevin to be released to a halfway house after his federal
      sentencing.

      for his federal charges. While he has already pleaded
      guilty and has accepted time served plus probation as
      punishment the issue of restitution still needs to be

     L.A. district attorney drops Mitnick case
     By Paul Elias, ZDNN
     August 6, 1999 6:09 PM PT

     The Los Angeles district attorney gave Kevin Mitnick a birthday present Friday, dropping its
     six-year-old computer hacking case against the convicted hacker. 
     
     That development could speed the release of the 35-year-old, removing an obstacle that could
     have prevented Mitnick from going free from federal prison soon after he is formally sentenced
     Monday in an unrelated federal case. 
     
     "We're ecstatic," said Carolyn Hagin, one of Mitnick's attorneys in the state case. 
     
     Deputy District Attorney Daniel Bershin said he dropped the state case because it had been
     "mischarged." 
     
     Dubious 'computer' crime
     In 1993, the district attorney charged Mitnick with one count of illegally accessing a Department
     of Motor Vehicles computer and retrieving confidential information. The problem with that charge
     is that Mitnick, posing as a Welfare Fraud investigator, simply picked up a telephone on Dec. 24,
     1992, and duped an employee accessing the DMV computer for him. 
     
     "Since Mitnick did not personally connect to the DMV computer, but either he or someone else
     communicated with the DMV technician via a telephone conversation," Bershin wrote in his
     motion to dismiss the case, "it would be difficult to prove that Mitnick gained entry to the DMV
     computer, or that he instructed or communicated with the logical, arithmetical or memory function
     resources of the DMV computer." 
     
     Bershin also confirmed at a July 28 hearing what many of Mitnick's supporters have been claiming
     f*or years: that their martyr has been the target of overzealous prosecution. 
     
     Bershin first informed Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Leland Harris of the district
     attorney's intention to drop the case at the July 28 hearing, a position that caught Harris off guard. 
     
     As early as July 7, Deputy District Attorney Larry Diamond -- who had originally handled
     Mitnick's case -- was vigorously arguing against any reduction in Mitnick's $1 million bail pending
     trial. 
     
     Judge 'curious'
     "So I'm curious as to why all of a sudden between July 7 and July 28 we have this radical change
     in position," the judge asked of Bershin. 
     
     "Well, I think to be quite candid, the answer, or course, is Mr. Diamond," Bershin said. "I know
     that Mr. Diamond has wanted to handle this matter personally for a long time ... and I know that
     Mr. Diamond personally believes that Mr. Mitnick has been skating through the system for a long
     time and has a great interest in him." 
     
     At that July 28 hearing, Harris refused to dismiss the case, saying to do so would be "a radical
     jump off the precipice to move to dismiss at this time." He ordered Bershin to submit a written
     motion to dismiss, which Harris granted Friday. 
     
     Halfway house an option
     Harris' action clears the way for Mitnick's freedom. He is due to be sentenced in federal court for
     several hacking charges he pleaded guilty to in March. His attorney in the federal case, Donald
     Randolph of L.A.'s Randolph & Levanas, said he will ask Central District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer
     to order Mitnick into a halfway house after formally sentencing him to 68 months in prison. 
     
     Randolph said he is optimistic Pfaelzer will grant the request, but if she doesn't Mitnick is set to go
     free sometime in January. 
     
     Still at issue is the amount of money Mitnick must repay in restitution. His victims, including several
     high-tech giants such as Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:SUNW) and Motorola Corp.
     (NYSE:MOT), say that Mitnick's hacking cost them millions of dollars in compromised intellectual
     property. 
     
     Federal prosecutors are seeking $1.5 million in restitution. Mitnick, through Randolph, argues that
     he is leaving prison broke and that conditions of his probation, once he is released, severely
     restrict his access to a computer, the only way he knows how to make a living. 
     
     Pfaelzer has indicated that she will order Mitnick to make some restitution, which she is scheduled
     to decide Monday as well. 
     
     Mitnick was arrested in 1995 after a high-profile, two-year, electronic manhunt for him.

     District attorney drops Mitnick case 
     By Dan Goodin
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     August 6, 1999, 7:35 p.m. PT 

     The Los Angeles district attorney's office has dropped state charges against Kevin Mitnick, the notorious hacker who
     pleaded guilty in March to wire fraud and other federal charges, according to a published report.

     Mitnick, who will receive a five-year sentence if a federal judge accepts the plea, could be released from jail early next year. He
     has been held in federal custody since he was captured in a high-profile investigation in 1995. He also faced separate state
     charges as well.

     But Deputy District Attorney Daniel Bershin said today he was dropping those charges, because they had been "mischarged," ZD
     Network News is reporting. The case stemmed from 1993 charges that Mitnick unlawfully accessed computers at the state
     department of motor vehicles.

     Bershin admitted in a brief filed today that the case was flawed because Mitnick never accessed the computer himself, but
     allegedly used posed as a welfare fraud inspector over the phone in order to get a DMV to retrieve information, ZDNN said.

     Mitnick is scheduled to appear in federal court in Los Angeles this Monday for sentencing before U.S. District Judge Mariana
     Pfaelzer.

08.0 An Accurate Look At Mitnick's Life Behind Bars

     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
     
      contributed by staff 
      There have been a few articles floating around the web
      that attempt to describe what Kevin is going through
      and the experiences he must endure. This one appears
      to be the most accurate and is based off only the third
      Mitnick interview granted to a media organization.

      Kevin Mitnick┤s Life -- Life in and around 6 South, 626

      

                                              ATTRITION Staff

     Recently, two of the Attrition Staff writing for OSAll caught up with
     Kevin Mitnick and asked a few more questions about his living
     conditions. We presented him with an article by Kimberly Tracey (-1-)
     to establish a baseline for our talk and a reason for this followup.

     Life as it REALLY stands 

     Here's a little bit about Kevin Mitnick's life at the Los Angeles Metro
     Detention Center (MDC), a bit more up to date: 

     At the MDC there IS a yard for exercising. It is called the "rec deck"
     (Recreation Deck), rather than a yard and offers fresh air and sunlight,
     through a protected metal grating. On this patio Kevin has the option of
     playing basketball, walking or using the universal weights. 

     The call for "lockup"(-1-) (known as 'lockdown' in most prisons
     including MDC) means that inmates must return to their cells. This is
     typically done for a count to ensure all inmates are still within the confines
     of the prison, or if any of the individuals get out of control. The times
     when they are all rounded up on the balcony means they are 'tossing
     cells' or doing a 'shakedown' (looking for contraband items). 

     There are two 'units' per floor. Each unit has three TV's giving a total of
     six per floor. However, inmates from one unit may not use the resources
     from (or visit) another unit. Short of personal or legal visits (or court
     appearances), they do not leave their unit. 

     As of May 24th, the vending machines were removed from the floors.
     Despite this, the microwaves (2 per unit) are still available. Along with
     the removal of vending, many items were added to the commissary. 

          "I never buy food from the guards. No inmates including me
          purchase food or any items from MDC staff. It's strictly
          forbidden," Kevin says. 

     The only source for Kevin to buy food is the commissary which offers a
     small variety of food (as well as toiletry items). 

     We learned that the MDC does offer a couple exercise bikes that still
     work. "I use them all the time," Kevin smiles. 

     While using one of the four phones in his unit, he often brings a stool
     from his cell to make the calls a bit more comfortable. Often times, the
     phones are turned on as early as 6am he says. The practice of 'buying'
     phone time is frowned upon by MDC staff. 

          "The MDC does not allow inmates to have any cash or change,
          money is contraband so it's impossible to buy phone time for a
          'few extra dollars,'" Kevin reports. 

     Since February, Kevin has been able to use the government approved
     laptop on weekdays, with appropriate supervision. This time is usually
     spent sorting through the many gigs of evidence in preparation for his
     case. Now that a plea has been entered, time is spent making a much
     more educated guess at the actual damage figures being leveled at him. 

     Unfortunately, the friendly advice about tapes and videos that was
     offered by Ms. Tracey is a bit inaccurate. 

          "I appreciate any tapes or CD's, however, I'll have to wait until
          I'm released before I can listen to them." 

     Kevin has no resource to play tapes or videos with or without his
     defense team present. 

     No Place Like Home 

     Each day that Kevin comes down to the visiting room, he carries a
     cardboard box overflowing with legal declarations, printed evidence,
     news articles and more. Ten minutes later, one of the MDC staff bring
     him the government approved laptop so that he can examine the bulk of
     the evidence. Outfitted with a locking device preventing floppy use,
     Kevin can only receive programs and evidence via CDROM. Dual
     booting into Redhat Linux and Windows 95, he is able access almost all
     of the evidence. To be more accurate, he can not access any of the
     evidence from the VMS backup tapes, megs of logs from various CDs,
     and of course the evidence still not provided by the government. 

     After visiting his direct family or legal staff, Kevin returns to what he has
     been forced to call 'home' for four years, five months, and twenty one
     days. Not that he or anyone else is counting. Home is a cell smaller than
     the largest of private visitation rooms reserved for legal visits. Those
     rooms are perhaps 8x10, and yet still larger than Kevin's cell (that he
     shares with one other inmate). Cell #626 sits off the 'common area' and
     is seperated by a wooden door with a narrow glass window, offering
     less view than the narrow window that grants him a peek of the Roybal
     Federal Building. Along with the other inmate, the tiny cell has two
     bunks, a toilet, sink, all acceptable personal possessions and a tendancy
     to give people a cramped feeling. 

     The common area is available to inmates from roughly 6:30 to 9:45. This
     area contains the bikes, microwaves, televisions and phones. Also
     provided are billiards and ping pong tables. While the common area may
     sound fun and recreational, it is not condusive to those trying to read or
     study legal briefs. 

     Kevin's cell has a lovely view of the sixth floor of the Roybal Federal
     Building. A building with more stringent metal detectors than the MDC
     even. Even from the sixth floor, he gets to view more federal offices. 

     A Day in the Life of.. 

     With a better image of the material life surrounding Kevin, hopefully it
     will be easier to envision a typical day.

           6:30 - wake up sign up for phone time (typically two 20 minute
          blocks) 
          7:00 - light breakfast (example: pastry and milk) 
          7:45 - head to patio, walk for half an hour 
          8:15 - weight lifting on patio 
          10:20 - use part of phone time 
          10:40 - grab lunch tray (example: eggs, burrito, potatoes, milk)
          lockdown for lunch 
          12:00 - "boring time" legal visits, phone calls, lay out in sun, read,
          socialize 
          3:45 - lockdown for count 
          4:45 - grab dinner tray for later use part of phone time 
          6:00 - ride bike, exercise 
          7:30 - shower eat dinner 
          9:45 - lockdown shave, read 
          11:00 - sleep 

     During most of his workouts, Kevin is able to listen to an AM/FM
     walkman. For those of you interested in his music selection, his radio is
     programmed with the following stations: 

          #1 93.1 
          #2 95.5 (KEZY) 
          #3 103.1 
          #4 106.7 (KROQ) 
          #5 98.7 (STAR) 

     Drop Him A Line 

     The letters and comments he receives are an uplift to say the least.
     Continued support and cards are welcome and he sends his thanks to
     the many people who have written him. Kevin enjoyed his birthday on
     August 6th, especially when the State of California opted to drop the
     outstanding charges leveled at him some seven years prior. Despite his
     birthday passing, cards or words of encouragement would be a great
     gift. Federal judge M. Pfaelzer sentencing him to the defense proposed
     restitution and 'time served' would be the best gift though. ;) If that is too
     much to ask, recommending his immediate release to a half way house
     would be acceptable. 

     As Ms. Tracey said, sending him money via postal money orders is
     appreciated so that he can enjoy it right away. Another way to support
     Kevin is to purchase 'Free Kevin' bumper stickers from
     www.freekevin.com as the profit goes toward his legal defense fund. For
     those not keeping up, Kevin is due to be sentenced on Monday, August
     9th at 1:30pm. Judge Pfaelzer can be found at the US Court House
     (-2-), room 12.

     Both of us have spent long hours locked in a government SCIF on
     previous security contracts. We were paid to be in these small
     depressing rooms and hack military networks. I could barely stand 8
     hours in those 10x10 rooms full of computers with no windows. Now,
     Kevin gets to sit in his less than 10x10 cell for allegedly hacking other
     networks. It's sick and ironic.

      Electronic Arts and Sony Computer Entertainment America Nab Internet
      Pirate Ring
      
      Companies file joint lawsuit against online pirates
      
      REDWOOD CITY, Calif. and FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- August 6, 1999--Declaring war on a major Internet pirate ring that illegally
      uploaded, traded and distributed copies of their software, U.S.-based Electronic Arts(tm) (Nasdaq:ERTS - news), the industry's largest entertainment software
      publisher, and Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), the company behind the PlayStation« game console, the world's best-selling videogame system,
      recently filed suit against certain alleged members of the ring in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Among other claims, the complaint
      asserts the defendants infringed the copyrights and trademarks of the two companies through the copying and distribution of software owned by Electronic Arts and
      SCEA. 
      
      United States Marshals and lawyers for the companies recently conducted a court-sanctioned seizure and impounded evidence at the location of a participant of the
      group that calls itself ``Paradigm.'' During the seizure, a computer, hard drives, CDs and other items related to the illegal operation were impounded by the Marshals.
      The complaint further notes that the seizure, as well as the investigation which preceded it, produced a significant amount of evidence against members of the
      worldwide ring located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Russia and other
      locations. The evidence identified by true name and location dozens of participants in the distribution of pirated software belonging to the companies. 
      
      While SCEA and Electronic Arts plan to continue the civil case against the pirates, they also continue to cooperate with law enforcement in the United States and will
      be turning over evidence to authorities in several of the other relevant countries for possible criminal action against the group's members. 
      
      ``Putting an end to software piracy is a top priority for our industry,'' said Ruth Kennedy, senior vice president and general counsel, Electronic Arts. ``Electronic Arts
      and SCEA believe that the break up of pirate Internet rings like this will be key to our success in combating the rising problem of Internet piracy. This action is part
      of our ongoing plan to find and prosecute these thieves.'' 
      
      ``Piracy of packaged entertainment software last year amounted to over US$3.2 billion worldwide for our industry alone. Electronic Arts alone lost more than $400
      million. Internet pirate rings like Paradigm contribute to these losses by uploading games where the industrial pirates in places such as Asia or Russia can download
      them, turn them into copies of packaged goods and rush them to the street -- sometimes even before we get the legitimate goods to market,'' Kennedy noted.
      Pre-release or day-of-release software is highly prized by pirate Internet rings, that compete for ``points'' in the pirate community by being the first to ``release'' an
      illegal version of the product, often with copy protection and other content removed. 
      
      Both companies praised the recently announced criminal ``I.P. Initiative'' by federal authorities including the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Customs,
      which as its goal has increased criminal prosecutions of pirates of intellectual property. 
      
      According to Riley Russell, vice president of legal and business affairs, Sony Computer Entertainment America, ``We will work diligently to ensure that these
      counterfeiters are fully prosecuted and that others who think Internet piracy and `trading' is acceptable will think again.'' Russell noted that last year alone,
      counterfeiting cost SCEA and Electronic Arts losses of several hundreds of millions of dollars around the globe. 
      
      Other Internet rings besides Paradigm that are also believed to be involved in the pirating of entertainment software include groups calling themselves ``Razor 1911,''
      ``Class,'' ``Origin,'' ``Hybrid'', ``Divine'', ``Fairlight'' and others, with members based in the United States and in many other countries around the world. The
      companies are confident evidence developed in the current case as well as continuing efforts by the entertainment software industry will result in additional civil
      actions and criminal prosecution of members of these groups in the future. 
      
      Electronic Arts, headquartered in Redwood City, California, is the world's leading interactive entertainment software company. Founded in 1982, Electronic Arts
      posted revenues of more than $1.2 billion for fiscal 1999. The company develops, publishes and distributes software worldwide for personal computers and video

     First regional computer crime
     laboratory set up in San Diego
    
     Forensic team will retrieve electronic
     evidence for use in trials
    
    
    
     By Bruce V. Bigelow  
     STAFF WRITER 
    
     August 6, 1999 
    
    
     Overwhelmed by the use of computers in illegal activities, federal authorities
     have formed a regional crime lab in San Diego that specializes in retrieving
     computerized data and preserving the evidence for trial.
    
     The San Diego Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory is being hailed by
     organizers as the first of its kind, and it already has become a nationwide
     model for law enforcement in other cities -- even before its FBI-trained
     specialists have received their first case.
    
     The lab also is expected to eventually conduct court-approved wiretap
     operations that call for intercepting Internet communications.
    
     "All of us involved in the investigation and prosecution of computer crime view
     the San Diego lab as a prototype of what we hope to establish in various
     jurisdictions around the country," said David Schindler, a federal prosecutor in
     Los Angeles who won convictions of Kevin Mitnick and other notorious
     hackers.
    
     Most of the lab's 14 forensic specialists are sworn officers from local police
     agencies, including the San Diego Police Department and the Sheriff's
     Department. The lab's electronic infrastructure was designed by computer
     security experts at the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command
     headquarters.
    
     "This is extremely important, not just a little important," said Alan Paller, a
     computer security expert at the SANS Institute, an international research and
     education cooperative for more than 60,000 system administrators.
    
     "The vast majority of discoveries (of network intrusions) go unresolved
     because there are no resources outside the FBI of any scale. If the probability
     of getting caught and put in jail is far-removed, why worry?"
    
     About $600,000 needed to renovate FBI offices and equip the facility was
     provided by two federal grants, said Mitch Dembin, an assistant U.S. attorney
     in San Diego who proposed the idea.
    
     "I sold this idea to the individuals who are doing this on their own in the
     wilderness of their own departments, and then I sold the idea to the
     department heads in those agencies," Dembin said.
    
     A total of 32 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies have agreed to
     support the lab, he added.
    
     "The idea is one I very much agree with," said Doug Tygar, a professor of
     computer science at the University of California Berkeley who specializes in
     computer security. "Unless they have the ability to deal with digital data, digital
     transactions, law enforcement agencies are going to be behind the curve."
    
     While the FBI established a computer forensics lab at its Washington
     headquarters years ago, experts say the agency also has maintained tight
     controls over the software tools used by its forensic specialists.
    
     "Until now, the FBI only trained its own people," Dembin said.
    
     The San Diego lab's staff members, who completed their FBI training seven
     weeks ago, are now working in temporary quarters until work on the new
     facility is completed in the next month or so.
    
     "What they're doing right now is developing the protocols and processes that
     will be applied to any case," Dembin said. "We're already receiving inquiries
     from all over country . . . which is interesting since we haven't prosecuted a
     single case yet."
    
     The interest prompted Dembin to organize a session about the San Diego lab
     during the High Technology Crime Investigation Association's annual meeting,
     to be held in San Diego's Town & Country Convention Center next month.
    
     The regional lab will help set forensic standards for local investigators and
     provide guidance in the way search warrants are served, computers are
     seized and data is retrieved for evidence at trial, said Bill Gore, who
     supervises the FBI office in San Diego.
    
     "We've been pretty lucky, I think, because so far the defense attorneys
     haven't really homed in on the procedures that we use," said Gore.
    
     The presentation of computerized data at trial can be as complex as DNA
     evidence, he added.
    
     The lab's investigators also are expected to deal with tricky investigations,
     such as a handful of employees who are using a corporate computer network
     for illegal activities.
    
     The "courts are reluctant to let the U.S. attorney shut down a business" by
     seizing control of a company's entire computer system, Dembin said, "so we
     have to come up with tools that minimize our interference with commerce."
    
     For Dembin and other prosecutors, however, a more practical problem
     stemmed from protracted delays in the analysis of computer-based evidence
     seized in cases that ranged from securities fraud to drug crimes.
    
     "There's been a bottleneck in analyzing computer or electronic evidence," said
     Schindler, who usually works with FBI forensics experts in Los Angeles.
    
     Said Dembin: "Putting aside the question of whether the forensics was done
     right, cases were getting disposed of before the seized computers were even
     analyzed."
    
     Dembin's first brush with computer crime occurred in 1991, when he
     prosecuted a disgruntled employee who tried to sabotage General Dynamics
     computers in San Diego with a "logic bomb."
    
     Since then, the 45-year-old prosecutor has handled his own share of
     malicious hacker cases. Over the past eight years, Dembin also saw how con
     artists converted their telemarketing scams into Internet schemes, and he
     oversaw bank fraud cases that relied on computerized financial records.
    
     "Now more and more the only place where documentary evidence exists is on
     the computer," Dembin said. "People are keeping their personal records of
     everyday activities on their computers, and criminal society is no different."

11.0 University Sys Admin Faced with 10 Years for Using Too Much Bandwidth

      A former University of Oklahoma systems administrator
      has been charged with using too much bandwidth. He
      faces a single count of disrupting the universities
      internet service after he allegedly set up a warez site
      on the University owned servers. While not charged with
      piracy or copyright infringement the local DA decided to
      prosecute under the Oklahoma Computer Crimes Act of
      1984 which states that it is a felony to "willfully and
      without authorization disrupt or cause the disruption of
      computer services or deny or cause the denial of access
      or other computer services to an authorized user of a
      computer, computer system or computer network." He
      faces up to 10 years in the state penitentiary and up to
      $100,000 in fines. (So now it is a crime to have a
      popular site? This article fails to mention if this person
      was a legitimate user of the network to begin with.)

      Disrupting Net access a cybercrime?
      By Robert Lemos, ZDNN
      August 6, 1999 3:28 PM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2310624,00.html
      
      A former system administrator of the University of Oklahoma has been charged under the state's
      computer-crime statutes with slowing the university's network to a crawl.
      
      Ryan Breding, 25, faces a single count of disrupting the university's Internet service in 1997, when
      hoards of incoming students downloaded pirated software from servers that he had allegedly set
      up on the university's network. 
      
      "There were times when the authorized users -- students -- were not able to access the Internet at
      all," said Scott Palk, first assistant attorney general for Oklahoma's Cleveland County District
      Attorney's Office.
      
      Known as warez (pronounced "wares"), the software is identical to store-bought versions and
      includes serial numbers to spoof the copy protection mechanisms. The downloads overloaded the
      network, and many students were denied access.
      
      Getting up to speed
      While distributing such software is illegal, the district attorney's office has only charged Breding
      with interfering with network operation. On that charge alone, the former employee faces up to 10
      years in the state penitentiary and up to $100,000 in fines.
      
      The Oklahoma Computer Crimes Act of 1984 makes it a felony to "willfully and without
      authorization disrupt or cause the disruption of computer services or deny or cause the denial of
      access or other computer services to an authorized user of a computer, computer system or
      computer network."
      
      An initial lack of familiarity with computer crimes stymied the investigation. State investigators and
      prosecutors needed to learn how to pursue digital criminals and examine the evidence. 
      
      "These are new crimes -- at least locally," said Palk. "Some people had to undergo training to look
      into it." 
      
      Palk stressed that, for the investigators, the case was a necessary learning experience. "This may
      be a hallmark of things to come," he said. "And we need to be ready."
      
      University officials would not comment for this story. A preliminary hearing is set to start on Aug.

      Five encryption technologies have made the final cut to
      be the next standard cryptographic mechanism used to
      protect sensitive government information. It has taken
      over a year to whittle the initial field of twelve entries
      down to five, one of which will replace DES, the current
      standard. The final standard is expected to be chosen
      by the Summer of 2001. The five finalists for the
      advanced encryption standard (AES), where named by
      the National Institute of Standards and Technology on
      Monday. The five finalists are MARS, RC6TM, Rijndael,
      Serpent, and Twofish.

      NIST names finalists in AES development
    
      BY DIANE FRANK (dfrank@fcw.com)
    
      The National Institute of Standards and Technology today named the five
      finalists in its development of the next-generation Advanced Encryption
      Standard.
    
      NIST has been working with 15 candidates from 12 countries for the past
      year to test their submissions for the AES algorithm. NIST will use AES to
      replace the Data Encryption Standard adopted in 1977 as a federal
      information processing standard for federal agencies. 
    
      The five finalists are 
    
        MARS, developed by IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y.
    
        RC6, developed by RSA Laboratories, Bedford, Mass.
    
        Rijndael, developed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen of Belgium.
    
        Serpent, developed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen of the
      United Kingdom, Israel and Norway, respectively.
    
        Twofish, developed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David
      Wagner, Chris Hall and Niels Ferguson, most of whom are associated with
      Counterpane Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.
    
      All of the candidate algorithms support cryptographic key sizes of 128, 192
      and 256 bits and were tested by NIST and other cryptographic groups
      around the world. 
    
      A full report on the process is available on the AES World Wide Web site at
      www.nist.gov/aes.

      DES is a step closer to the dustbin. 
      
      The U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) today
      announced five finalists in the two-year competition to find a replacement for the Data Encryption
      Standard, which has served as the government's basic encryption standard since 1977. 
      
      The replacement, to be called the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), should be completed by
      the summer of 2001, according to NIST. 
      
      The five finalists include: 
      
           MARS, developed by IBM in Armonk, NY. IBM researchers also created DES back in
           the '70s. 
           RC6, developed by Ron Rivest (inventor of the RSA public key algorithm and several other
           well-known hashing and private key algorithms) and RSA Laboratories in Bedford, Mass. 
           Rijndael, developed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen of Belgium. 
           Serpent, developed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen of the United
           Kingdom, Israel and Norway. 
           Twofish, developed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris
           Hall and Niels Ferguson of Counterpane Systems in Minneapolis. Schneier also developed
           the popular Blowfish symmetric algorithm. 
      
      Resisting brute force
      DES -- as well as its replacement, AES -- is what cryptographers call a symmetric or private key
      algorithm. A symmetric algorithm requires that both parties receiving encryption have a copy of the
      same encryption key in order to read the scrambled data. It is also likely the most widely used
      encryption algorithm in the world today, supported by most commercial encryption products. 
      
      But DES has proven to be easy prey for modern technology. It uses keys of 56 bits, which were
      first broken nearly three years ago. In January 1999, cryptographers using a special DES-cracking
      machine, along with a nationwide network of PCs, were able to crack DES in less than 24 hours. 
      
      The crackers used a "brute force" method of attack to solve the mathematical factoring behind
      DES. In other words, they put a lot of processing horsepower against the algorithm and were able
      to solve it -- something that has been feasible only in the last couple of years because of
      improvements in chip technology. 
      
      AES on the scene
      Enter the AES. NIST first requested proposals for the AES in September 1997. Each of the
      candidate algorithms supports key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. A 128-bit key cannot be
      broken using known technology today. Each added bit essentially doubles the key strength. 
      
      RSA Data Security Inc. CEO Jim Bidzos used the following analogy at the company's conference
      in January: A 40-bit key is the water that fills a spoon. A 56-bit key is the water that fills a small
      swimming pool. A 128-bit key would be all of the water on the planet. 
      
      "The process has always been about standardization," said Counterpane's Schneier. "AES will be
      the encryption standard for the next 20 or so years, and hence will be used in applications that we
      can't imagine. If a single algorithm is to be chosen for AES, it must be efficient in all current and
      imagined applications." 
      
      NIST will make the five finalist algorithms publicly available. Analysis of the finalists will be
      presented at a conference in April 2000, and public comments will be accepted until May 15,
      2000, according to the NIST.

      On Saturday August 7th, President Clinton issued an
      executive order to establish a working group to examine
      unlawful conduct on the internet. The group is to
      determine if current laws are adequate to combat online
      crime such as child pornography and sales of illegal
      drugs. The executive order also calls for closer
      examination of the tools used by law enforcement to
      investigate these crimes. This could be interpreted as a
      major call for key escrow. The group has been ordered
      to complete its reports within 120 days.

      Clinton establishes Net crime taskforce
      By Maria Seminerio, ZDNN

      UPDATED 3:30 PM PT
      
      President Clinton on Saturday established a working group to address cybercrimes, including
      online sales of illegal drugs and explosives, and online child pornography trafficking. 
      
      The working group is charged with determining whether existing federal laws are sufficient to
      combat Internet-related crime. 
      
      Also, in what seems like a call for widespread key escrow for encrypted communications, Clinton
      ordered the task force to determine "the extent to which new technology tools, capabilities or legal
      authorities may be required for effective investigation and prosecution of unlawful conduct" online. 
      
      The issue of key escrow -- allowing law enforcement a guaranteed "back door" into encrypted
      online messages -- is hugely controversial, and has been a central bone of contention in the debate
      over the Clinton administration's encryption export policies. The director of the Federal Bureau of
      Investigation, Louis Freeh, is a vocal supporter of key escrow, but online privacy advocates
      believe any such plan would be disastrous for individual Internet users. 
      
      "It's a valid concern," said David Sobel, general counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information
      Center, when asked whether the move is a precursor to a more aggressive key escrow push. 
      
      Why no wider investigation?
      With the controversy over illegal Internet porn and online drug and gun sales having sizzled for
      some time, Sobel said it's unclear why the White House should now launch a wider investigation. 
      
      It's also unclear what action, if any, Clinton will take after the group completes its report, a White
      House spokesman told ZDNN Monday. 
      
      Clinton could urge Congress to pass new Net crime laws, although there is no specific plan for him
      to do so, the spokesman said. 
      
      Another administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the task force's work
      won't be specifically aimed at the key escrow issue. 
      
      "We just wanted to take a step back and see what new laws, if any, are needed" to address
      cybercrimes, the official told ZDNN. 
      
      The task force will include Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno, and other federal officials, such as
      the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of the Treasury, the
      Commerce Secretary and the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The
      co-chairs of the Advisory Commission on E-Commerce will serve as liaisons. 
      
      Clinton ordered the group to complete a report within 120 days, and many federal agencies will
      have a chance to respond before it is made public.

      5:00 p.m.  9.Aug.99.PDT
      President Clinton has asked his advisers to come up with new ways to combat illegal online activity including child porn and the sale of guns, drugs,
      and explosives. 
      
      In announcing a new working group on unlawful conduct on the Internet, the Administration stopped short of calling for new laws. Instead, Vice
      President Gore said the feds may need new technology tools, capabilities, or legal authorities to fight cybercrime. 
      
            
      "What we need to do is find new answers to old crimes," said Gore in a statement released Friday. 
      
      About 11 federal agencies will participate in the working group, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the FBI; the Commerce
      Department; the Food and Drug Administration; and the Drug Enforcement Agency. 
      
      Each agency will solicit ideas for deterring cybercrime from the private sector and from state and local law enforcement officials. 
      
      "The working group will help to make the Internet a safe place for all Americans by examining the extent to which existing federal law and
      technological tools are effective in combating crime on the Internet," Gore said. 
      
      The working group will make its recommendations in four months in the context of current policies and principles. Among those principles: that
      industry should self-regulate, that laws should be technology-neutral, and that the Internet is an important medium for commerce and free speech. 
      
      The administration announced the new strategy only weeks after lawmakers and privacy activists panned a Clinton-approved plan to develop a
      nationwide surveillance network. 
      
      That proposed network, recommended by the White House National Security Council and known as the Federal Intrusion Detection Network
      (Fidnet), sought to fight cybercrime by vacuuming up electronic signals. 
      
      Prominent House republicans slammed that plan. House Majority Leader Dick Armey warned that the Fidnet could grow into an "Orwellian" system.

     TAIPEI, Taiwan (Reuters) - A person claiming to be from mainland China hacked into several Taiwan government Internet sites
     to insert pro-China messages amid a heated row between the two sides over Taiwan's political status.
   
     "Only one China exists and only one China is needed," read a message inserted Sunday into the Web site of the Control Yuan
     -- Taiwan's highest watchdog agency.
   
     In apparent references to President Lee Teng-hui's controversial call for "special state-to-state" ties between Taiwan and China,
     the message said Taiwan was and would always be an inseparable part of China.
   
     "The Taiwanese government headed by Lee Teng-hui can not deny it."
   
     The same messages -- in Chinese and English -- were placed in several other government Web sites, a Control Yuan official
     said Monday.
   
     "It looks like it was the same person who claimed to come from Hunan province," the official, who declined to be identified,
     said by telephone.
   
     The official said public Web sites were relatively easy to hack into.
   
     "It is a public Web site containing open information, so we didn't think firewalls were necessary," the official said. "Now we
     know it's a problem and we will fix it in the next few days."
   
     Firewalls are electronic security screens.
   
     Lee's redefinition of cross-strait ties has infuriated Beijing, which views the island as a wayward province and vows to bring it
     under mainland rule, by force if necessary.

      The Defense Department has ordered all administrative

      DOD: Change Passwords

      BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

      Concerned that efforts to fix computer systems for the Year 2000 problem
      may expose its information infrastructure to cyberattacks, the Defense
      Department has ordered its network managers to change all administrative and
      user passwords on their unclassified networks.

      The order is the result of mandatory guidance issued last month to all of the
      military services' network security organizations by the Joint Task Force for
      Computer Network Defense. While a JTF-CND spokesperson could not
      confirm or deny rumors that the guidance may be the result of a recent breach
      of computer security, the spokesperson said that the FBI's National
      Infrastructure Protection Center is currently investigating intrusions into
      unclassified DOD networks.

      "We're trying to start a better process for password protection," the
      spokesperson said. "We gave [our components and other DOD
      organizations] several weeks to do this [because] we know it can't be done
      overnight."

      The JTF-CND, which was formed last December, serves as the focal point
      for DOD to organize the defense of DOD computer networks and systems.
      When cyberattacks are detected, the JTF-CND is responsible for directing
      departmentwide defenses to stop or contain damage and restore DOD
      network functions operations.

      The mandatory actions called for by the JTF-CND directive include changing
      all administrative and user passwords for all unclassified systems and then
      restarting the operating systems for systems that are connected to the
      network. The process is known as a "warm boot" and is not a full shutdown of
      the system, the spokesperson said.

      Major commands affected by the guidance and responsible for managing
      compliance in their respective services include the Air Force Information
      Warfare Center, the Army's Land Information Warfare Activity, the Defense
      Information Systems Agency, the Marine Corps' Marine Forces-CND and
      the Navy Component Task Force-CND.

      As a result of the directive, the NCTF-CND issued classified and unclassified
      messages ordering password changes. However, a spokesman for the Space
      and Naval Warfare Systems Command, one of the primary recipients of the
      message, declined to comment because of the sensitivity of the message's
      content.

      In an administrative message issued last week by the NCTF-CND, the Navy
      offered technical guidance to system administrators on how to deal with the
      lack of password date-change tracking functionality in Microsoft Corp.'s
      Windows NT.

      As a result, the Navy has made three software tools available over the Internet
      to help administrators automate the enforcement of password changes.

      In May, Art Money, senior civilian official acting as the assistant secretary of
      Defense for command, control, communications and intelligence, issued a
      DOD-wide memorandum about the potential threat to DOD networks posed
      by the Year 2000 computer problem. In that memo, Money cited DOD
      Administrative Instruction 26, which provides specific guidance on the use of
      passwords.

      Belgian Hacker Warns Of Internet Security Risk
      
      BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A computer hacker who broke into Belgium's
      leading Internet access provider vowed Monday to carry on attacking
      Web sites and databases in a bid to alert Belgium to the security risks 
      of the Internet.
      
      ``ReDatAck'', a man in his twenties, told Reuters by telephone he had 
      broken into the database of Skynet, owned by Belgian state-run telecomm-
      unications operator Belgacom, Friday night and obtained secret information
      on over 1,000 users.
      
      ``I have...their Visa (credit card) numbers and expiration dates, their 
      login and passwords, access to their Web sites,'' ''ReDatAck'' said, stressing
      he wanted to  `wake up Belgium'' to the Internet's security risks rather 
      than misuse the information.
      
      ``Nobody thinks about security,'' he said.
      
      Skynet director Philippe Lemmens said Monday he planned to file a complaint
      against ``ReDatAck'' and assured users that security had been stepped up against
      future hackers.
      
      But ``ReDatAck'', who claimed he had also broken into the free address book server
      of U.S. Internet portal Lycos, was undeterred.
      
      ``I'll go on hacking. They can try to find me. It doesn't scare me. If they do find
       me, it will make more publicity,'' he said, adding that he was currently working on
      breaking into a hospital database. He declined to say which hospital.

      By spoofing IRDP Router Advertisements, an attacker
      can remotely add default route entries on a remote
      system, including most Windows machines and some
      Solaris systems. The attackers default route entry will
      be preferred over the DHCP servers default route. DHCP
      addressing is used by many corporations, cable modem
      systems, and dialup ISPs. This attack significantly
      increases a users risk to passive snooping,
      man-in-the-middle attacks, and denial of service
      attacks.

                  Source code: http://www.l0pht.com/advisories/rdp.tar.gz
                               code written by Silicosis & Mudge
      
      
      I. Problem
      ----------
      
        The ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) comes enabled by default on
      DHCP clients that are running Microsoft Windows95 (w/winsock2),
      Windows95b, Windows98, Windows98se, and Windows2000 machines.  By
      spoofing IRDP Router Advertisements, an attacker can remotely add default
      route entries on a remote system.  The default route entry added by the
      attacker will be preferred over the default route obtained from the DHCP
      server. While Windows2000 does indeed have IRDP enabled by default, it
      less vulnerable as it is impossible to give it a route that is preferred
      over the default route obtained via DHCP. 
      
        SunOS systems will also intentionally use IRDP under specific
      conditions. For Solaris2.6, the IRDP daemon, in.rdisc, will be started
      if the following conditions are met:
      
                      . The system is a host, not a router.
                      . The system did not learn a default gateway from a 
                        DHCP server.
                      . The system does not have any static routes.
                      . The system does not have a valid /etc/defaultrouter
                        file.
      
      It should be noted that the important point of this advisory is not
      that ICMP Router Solicitation and Advertisement packets have no 
      authentication properties. Yes, this is a problem but it has long been 
      known. The dangerous aspect comes in various MS platforms enabling 
      this protocol and believing it _even when the DHCP setup specifies 
      router information_ (ie the operating system does this even though 
      you believe you are telling it NOT TO).
      
      The tool provided with this advisory is the basis of what would 
      be used for everything from web page hacks, stealing credentials,
      modifying or altering data, etc. involving vulnerable systems. 
      We believe most cable modem DHCP clients and large internal 
      organizations are at risk.
        
      II. Risks
      ---------
      
        The ICMP Router Discovery Protocol does not have any form of
      authentication, making it impossible for end hosts to tell whether or not
      the information they receive is valid.  Because of this, attackers 
      can perform a number of attacks:
      
         Passive monitoring:  In a switched environment, an attacker
                              can use this to re-route the outbound traffic of
                              vulnerable systems through them.  This will allow
                              them to monitor or record one side of the
                              conversation.
                              
                              * For this to work, and attacker must be on the
                              * same network as the victim.
      
          Man in the Middle:  Taking the above attack to the next level, the
                              attacker would also be able to modify any of the 
                              outgoing traffic or play man in the middle. 
      
                              By sitting in the middle, the attacker can act as
                              a proxy between the victim and the end host. The
                              victim, while thinking that they are connected directly
                              to the end host, they are actually connected to the
                              attacker, and the attacker is connected to the end
                              host and is feeding the information through.  If
                              the connection is to a secure webserver that uses SSL,
                              by sitting in the middle, the attacker would be able
                              to intercept the traffic, unencrypted. 
      
                              A good example of this risk is on-line banking;
                              an attacker playing man-in-the-middle would be able
                              to intercept all of the banking information that 
                              is relayed, without the victim's knowledge.
      
                              * For this to work, and attacker must be on the 
                              * same network as the victim.
      
          Denial of Service:  Remote attackers can spoof these ICMP packets and
                              remotely add bad default-route entries into a
                              victims routing table.  Because the victim's
                              system would be forwarding the frames to the
                              wrong address, it will be unable to reach other
                              networks.
      
                              Unfortunately, DHCP has quickly become popular and is
                              relied upon in most companies. In some cases, such as
                              cable & *DSL modems, users are required to use DHCP.
      
                              Because of the large number of vulnerable systems,
                              and the fact that this attack will penetrate firewalls
                              that do not stop incoming ICMP packets, this Denial
                              of Service attack can become quite severe. 
                              
      
        It should be noted that the above attacks are documented in Section 7,
      of RFC 1256.  However, the RFC states states that the attacks are
      launched by an attacker on the same network as the victim. In the Denial
      of Service attack, this is not the case; an attacker can spoof IRDP
      packets and corrupt the routing tables on systems that are on remote
      networks.
      
        While these attacks are not new, the fact that Windows95/98 DHCP
      clients have been vulnerable for years, is.  On systems running SunOS &
      Solaris, it is easy to find documentation on IRDP by looking at the
      startup scripts or manpages.  On Windows95/98, however, information
      has only become recently available in the Knowledge Bank.
      
      
      III. Technical Details
      ----------------------
      
       Upon startup, a system running MS Windows95/98 will always send 3 ICMP
      Router Solicitation packets to the 224.0.0.2 multicast address.  If the
      machine is NOT configured as a DHCP client, it ignores any Router
      Advertisements sent back to the host.
      
        However, if the Windows machine is configured as a DHCP client, any
      Router Advertisements sent to the machine will be accepted and processed.
      Once an Advertisement is received, Windows checks to see how many Gateway
      entries the packet contains.  If the packet contains only 1 entry, it
      checks to make sure the IP source address of the Advertisement is inside
      the hosts subnet.   If it is, the Router Address entry inside the
      advertisement is checked to see that it is also within the host's subnet.
      If so, a new default route entry is added.  If the address is outside the
      subnet, it the advertisement is silently ignored.
      
        If a host receives a Router Advertisment that contains 2 or more Router
      Addresses, the host will processes the packet even though the IP source
      address is not local.  If the host finds a Router Address inside the
      advertisement that is inside the host's subnet, it will add a default
      route entry for it. 
      
        Because the host does not care about the IP source address of the
      Advertisement as long as it has more than one entry, attackers can now
      create bogus IRDP packets that will bypass anti-spoofing filters.
      
       Before the host can add a new default route entry, it has to determine
      the route metric.  On Windows95/98, normal default route entries obtained
      from a DHCP server have a metric of 1.  In order to determine the metric
      for the default route entry obtained via IRDP, the Windows host subtracts
      the Advertisement's Preference value from 1000.  By creating an ICMP
      Router Advertisement with a preference of 1000, the default gateway route
      added will have a metric of 0, making it the preferred default route.
      
       By adjusting the Lifetime value in the advertisement, an attacker can
      adjust how many seconds the gateways are valid for.
      
      
      IV. Fixes / Work-arounds
      ------------------------
      
       Firewall / Routers:
              Block all ICMP Type 9 & Type 10 packets.  This should protect
              against remote Denial of Service attacks.
      
       Windows95/98:
              
              The Microsoft Knowledge Base contains an article that gives info
              on how to disable IRDP. It can be found at:
      
              http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q216/1/41.asp
              
              Brief Summary of article:
      
                IRDP can be disabled manually by adding "PerformRouterDiscovery"
                value name and setting it to a dword value of 0, under the
                following registry key(s): 
      
                    HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\NetTrans\####
      
                Where #### is the binding for TCP/IP. More than one TCP/IP
                binding may exist. 
      
       Solaris:
              
              Configure your host to obtain a default gateway through DHCP,
              static routes, or via the /etc/defaultrouter file. For more
              information on IRDP refer to in.rdisc's man-page. 
      
      
      V. Detection
      -------------
      
        L0pht has released a NFR Intrusion Detection Module to detect both
        Router Solicitations and Advertisements. You can find it at:
              http://www.l0pht.com/NFR
         
        NFR information can be found at http://www.nfr.net
      
      
      VI. Source Code
      -----------
      
       L0pht is making available Proof-of-Concept code that will let individuals
      test their systems & firewalls.
      
      The source code can be found at: http://www.l0pht.com/advisories/rdp.tar.gz
      
      Usage is fairly straight forward:
      
      Usage: rdp -v -l -s -d &lt;delay> -p &lt;pref> -t &lt;lifetime> -i &lt;dev>
                 -S &lt;src> -D &lt;dst> -R &lt;rtr> -r &lt;optional 2nd rtr>
      
              -v verbose
              -l listen mode
              -s send mode
              -d &lt;delay time between sending packets>
              -n &lt;number of rdp packets to send>
              -I &lt;ID value to place in IP packet>
              -p &lt;preference level>
              -t &lt;lifetime>
              -i &lt;interface to use for sniffing>
              -S &lt;source address to put in outgoing rdp packet>
              -D &lt;destination address to put in outgoing rdp packet>
              -R &lt;router address to advertise in rdp packet>
              -r &lt;optional 2nd router address to advertise in rdp packet>
      
      
      Misc software notes:
      
      Listen Mode:    Software listens for ICMP Router Solicitations.  If the
                      '-s' flag is specified as well, the software will answer 
                      the Solicitations with ICMP Router Advertisements.
      
       Preference:    If the preference is not specified, it will use a default
                      of 1000, which will give the default route a metric of 0
                      on affected Windows systems.
      
      2nd Router Addr: By using the '-r' flag and specifying a second router address
                      entry, the packet can contain a bogus source address and still
                      be processed for correct gateway entries by the end host.

      Another Fed Web site knocked out
      By Charles Cooper, ZDNN
      August 10, 1999 11:01 PM PT
      URL: 
      
      The Web site for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was hacked Tuesday night.
      
      Instead of the usual bureaucratic greetings found on government Web sites, people attempting to
      access the page were met by a cartoon character of a female vamp holding a whip.
      
      The hack, which was claimed by "Sarin," also left a brief note, taunting administrators for leaving
      their site vulnerable to hacks after "widespread publicity" given to copycat attacks in the last
      several months.
      
      "I'd seriously consider hiring a new admin if I were you," Sarin wrote.
      
      It was unclear when the Web site went down, but in an e-mail to ZDNN at 7:56 PM Pacific Time,
      Sarin wrote, "Does anyone care I have complete control over the Federal Energy Regulatory
      Commission?"
      
      Attempts to reach Sarin for comment were not immediately successful.
      
      Hackers intent on teaching sloppy system administrators an embarrassing lesson have carried out
      attacks against numerous federal Web sites this year, most prominently those operated by NASA,
      the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Army.
      
      This isn't a new phenomenon. Indeed, in a 1998 report, the U.S. General Accounting Office
      chastised many government agencies for leaving holes in their information security defenses.

                                                                           Updated 8:38 AM ET August 10, 1999
    
      TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan may be dwarfed by its saber-rattling rival, mainland China, but it has shown it is not to be trifled
      with on at least one battleground -- cyberspace.
    
      Hackers from the computer-savvy island have inserted pro-Taiwan messages into several Communist Chinese government Web
      sites in retaliation for a similar attack on Taiwan government sites by a mainland Chinese hacker.
    
      The web attacks sparked concern from military authorities who said an Internet war could add to already simmering tension
      over Taiwan's drive for equal status with the mainland.
    
      Taiwan news media reported Tuesday that several local hackers had succeeded in inserting Taiwan's flag, a sound file that
      played its national anthem and pictures of Taiwan presidential candidates on mainland Chinese Web sites.
    
      Statements like "Counter the Chinese Communists," "Taiwan does not belong to China" and "Seriously, Taiwan is better" also
      popped up on some of the sites.
    
      The hackers from Taiwan, which makes many of the world's computers, were also believed responsible for a revolving image of
      the Japanese cartoon figure Hello Kitty on one Web site.
    
      The hackers struck after a weekend attack on official Taiwan sites by a person claiming to be from mainland China, who
      inserted messages such as "Only one China exists and only one China is needed."
    
      The mainland hacker was apparently angered by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's call for "special state-to-state" ties between
      Taiwan and China, something Beijing has furiously condemned and threatened to punish with military action.
    
      Beijing views Taiwan as a wayward province and vows to bring it under mainland rule.

      A new Melissa like virus called VBS/Monopoly uses a

      sending itself to entries inside your address book but so
      far has not become wide spread. It also sends a wide
      variety of information about the infected computer to
      numerous other email addresses.

      Aug. 10 ù  ThereÆs a new Melissa-like computer
      virus that not only attacks Microsoft software, it
      taunts the software giantÆs leader. The so-called
      VBS/Monopoly virus pops up a dialog box that
      says, ôBill Gates is guilty of monopoly. Here is
      the proof. :-)ö and then displays a picture of
      Gates superimposed on a Monopoly game board.
      It also sends itself to every e-mail in the victimÆs
      address book. But anti-virus firms say the virus
      is not yet spreading widely around the Internet.
      
     NOTICE OF THE VIRUS WAS apparently first
     posted by a Russian anti-virus lab, Kaspersky Labs AVP,
     on Monday. 
            (Microsoft is a partner in MSNBC.)
            Like Melissa, it arrives to victims as an e-mail
     attachment to a note. The subject line on the e-mail is ôBill
     Gates joke.ö But unlike Melissa, anti-virus companies have
     been alerted to it before it was able to spread, so it wonÆt
     likely have Melissa-like widespread impact.
            Users who donÆt double-click on the attachment, which
     is named MONOPOLY.VBS, cannot be infected. The .vbs
     extension indicates that the program is written in MicrosoftÆs
     Visual Basic scripting language. According to Dan Takata
     of Data Fellows, programs written with VBScript operate
     only under Windows 98 and Windows 2000 (unless
     Windows Scripting Host has been installed separately). 
            Along with displaying the image of Gates, the
     worm/virus sends itself to every e-mail in the victimÆs
     Outlook address book. 


            It also collects information about the victim, including
     registered user name and organization, network computer
     name, country and area code, language, Windows version
     and Internet Explorer start page. It sends that information to
     a variety of e-mail addresses, probably to be accessed later
     by the virus author. 
            But the virus has not been detected ôin the wild,ö
     according to anti-virus companies.
            ôItÆs still a zoo virus,ö said Network AssociatesÆ Tony
     Wells, meaning at the moment no victims have been
     identified, and the program has been confined to anti-virus
     laboratories. ôWeÆre classifying it as a low risk.ö Wells said
     Network AssociatesÆ anti-virus products have been
     updated to protect customers from the virus.

      CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (August 10, 1999 6:58 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - A $640 million
      electronic database of fingerprints will help police nationwide decide within two hours whether
      a suspect should be freed on bail or held in custody, FBI officials say. 
      
      Instead of waiting more than 20 days for critical information, judges and law enforcement
      agencies in 15 states now can uncover a suspect's identity and criminal history before leaving
      the courthouse. 
      
      All 50 states are expected to be connected within the next few years.

     45 nations have been named Enemies of the Internet by
     Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF). The report lists

     banned sections of the Internet. Some of the countries
     mentioned in the report where Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
     Burma, China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea,
     Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Vietnam.

     PARIS, FRANCE, 1999 AUG 9 (NB) &lt;br> By Martyn Williams, Newsbytes.
     
     new report by Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) has named 45 nations
     the group considers enemies of the Internet for the blocking and
     filtering or all-out banning the nations impose on Internet access.
     Of the 45 nations, RSF said 20 can be described as real enemies of
     the Internet for their actions. They are: the countries of Central
     Asia and the Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Tajikistan,
     Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), Belarus, Burma, China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
     Libya, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia
     and Vietnam.
      
      Many of the 20 nations are singled out for restrictions that make
     all Internet users access the network through a single, state-run
     ISP. These nations include Belarus, the nations of Central Asia, Sudan
     and Tunisia.
      
      China was singled out for its close monitoring of Internet use despite
     the rapid pace with which Internet use is growing. RSF singled out
     the case of computer technician Lin Hai, who was jailed for supplying
     Chinese e-mail addresses to a US-based dissident site that publishes
     an e-mail newsletter critical of the government, and the June closure
     of 300 unlicensed cybercafes in Shanghai.
      
      The group also highlighted China's periodic blocking of the Websites
     of dissident organizations and international news organizations
     including BBC Online and New Century Net.
      
      Other nations were taken to task for government-controlled filtering
     of the Internet which means, according to RSF, medical students in
     Iran are unable to access Websites dealing with anatomy and surfing
     via any of Saudi Arabia's private ISPs run through government filters
     that seek to maintain Islamic values.
      
      However, the situation is even worse in other countries.
      
      In Burma, said RSF, Internet access is via a state-run ISP and anyone
     who owns a computer must declare it to the government or face the
     possibility of a 15 jail sentence if the machine is discovered.
     Restrictions in Vietnam mean all Internet use has to be approved by
     the government through permits from the interior ministry and access
     via state-run ISPs.
       
       Journalists working for an online newspaper in Sierra Leone have been
     attacked, said RSF, with two from the daily The Independent Observer
     being arrested in June after accusations that they were working with
     the foreign based online newspaper Ninjas.
      
      And citizens of Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Syria have no direct
     access to the Internet and even the official sites of the governments
     of these countries are maintained on servers overseas. In the case
     of Iraq, the few official servers are in Jordan while the North Korean
     news agency maintains its site from Tokyo.
      
       Concluding its report, RSF called on the governments of the 20 nations
     to abolish the state monopoly on Internet access, the obligation on
     citizens to register before obtaining access, censorship through the
     use of filters, to lift controls on e-mail and enable more privacy
     online and to call off Internet-related legal proceedings.
       
       It also called on Burma, China, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia and
     Tajikistan to ratify and enforce the International Covenant on Civil
     and Political Rights, Article 19 of which stipulates that "everyone
     shall have the right (...) to receive and impart information and ideas
     of all kinds, regardless of frontiers (...)".
     &lt;p>The covenant has been signed by a number of the 20 nations singled
     out in the report and RSF asked those countries to respect the contents
     of Article 19. Those countries include Azerbaijan, Belarus, Iran,
     Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Libya, North Korea, Uzbekistan, Sierra
     Leone, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Vietnam.

      Never a cop when you need one
      By David Raikow, Sm@rt Reseller
      August 11, 1999 10:46 AM PT

      In his keynote address at the WebSec security conference on Tuesday, former federal prosecutor
      Mark Rasch outlined one more rationale for a robust and comprehensive corporate security
      policy. If you're not prepared to respond to a system intrusion entirely in-house, you may be even
      less ready to deal with the consequences of going to the authorities for help, he warned. 
      
      Rasch, who was responsible for the prosecution of Robert Morris and the investigations of Kevin
      Mitnick and the "Cuckoo's Egg" hackers, described a legal system struggling to keep up with new
      technology and failing.
      
      In an attempt to address threats real and perceived, Congress has passed extraordinarily broad
      cybercrime laws, giving prosecutors enormous discretion, Rasch claimed. 
      
      We're all felons
      "We have enacted new statutes that make felons of us all," said Rasch. "If you've e-mailed your
      cousin from the office, you're probably a felon." 
      
      While law enforcement agencies aren't likely to bother with the average violation of corporate
      e-mail policy, their priorities are no more likely to match most users'. 
      
      Most IS shops probably would hope to chase intruders off as quickly and quietly as possible while
      minimizing the damages. But the FBI, according to Rasch, is probably more interested in a
      high-profile conviction and may want to prolong an intrusion in order to collect evidence. 
      
      The legal impact of a security breach may fall even more heavily on corporations than on the guilty
      party. An intruder using a company's servers to strike at other machines, for example, could leave
      that company exposed to "downstream liability" in civil court.
      
      And certainly a solvent corporation will present a more attractive defendant in such cases than the
      average cracker, he said. 
      
      Rasch laid out a situation in which an employee had used corporate servers to acquire and
      distribute pirated software. The business, which had unknowingly been using some of this
      software, was potentially subject to millions of dollars in fines. 
      
      Law is a 'blunt instrument'
      Rasch emphasized that it may be essential to notify the authorities after a breach, particularly as it
      may be required by law. Government agencies also have assets--subpoena powers, investigative
      resources--that may be necessary to adequately respond to an attack. 
      
      The key is to have an established plan for addressing these concerns so that employees are not
      forced to make ad-hoc decisions in the heat of the moment, he said. 
      
      "Law is a blunt instrument to use against cybercrime," Rasch concluded, "You should know what
      you're doing before you try."

     Armed forces are adapting to
     network-centric warfare

     Vice Adm. Arthur K. Cebrowski, described as the U.S. Navy's computer guru, is
     president of the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., and instrumental in addressing
     military needs in the information age. Cebrowski outlined his ideas on network-centric
     warfare, which aims to link the Navy's resources -- from personnel to weapons --
     through a computer network, Tuesday at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey.
     Prior to the speech, Cebrowski spoke with Mercury News Staff Writer Shashank
     Bengali. This is an edited transcript of their conversation:

     Q Where did the concept of network-centric warfare come from?

     A - It is the military's response to the information age. We can have well-informed soldiers and sailors and marines out there in the
     field but operating according to military principles that help organize their behavior. Forces will self-synchronize themselves from
     the bottom up, attaining a degree of efficiency and effectiveness that hasn't been possible before.

     Q - And you're able to coordinate forces over wide geographic areas as well?

     A - Yes. Just as in the information age, technology has changed the importance of territory and geography, you find the same thing
     in the military enterprise. That's why you see so much these days about striking targets from widely dispersed forces. So
     network-centric warfare derives its power from well-informed but geographically dispersed forces that have a high degree of
     shared awareness.

     Q - Do you think the military has lagged behind the rest of the world in implementing networking technology?

     A - There's a famous old Roman saying that the military walks in step with society but several paces back. And part of that is
     because the military is responsible for securing the most fundamental interests of the state; that is, the security of the people. And
     consequently, it tends to be strategically risk-averse. So before the military will make a dramatic shift, it will look for some very
     good evidence. We believe that that evidence is not only at hand, but that it's obvious, and the military is making that adjustment.

     Q - How much will you have to overhaul, or at least, shift, your personnel to accommodate these changes?

     A - One of the things that happens when there's a shift as great as this is that different skills are valued in different ways. And what
     you're seeing is a revaluing upward of those personnel who have facility in information tech broadly, both on the communication
     and executing side. It's also true in information-gathering, or what we call the ``sensing'' side. This is not just in war fighting, but it
     extends to everything we do. The secretary of the Navy divides its concerns into three areas: how we live, how we work and
     how we fight. We've been vigorously applying it at all three of those levels.

     Q - Give a few examples of how this has affected how you fight.

     A - Well, we've spent a considerable amount of money on what we call the IT21 program, Information Technology for the 21st
     century. What it is, is high-quality information exchange capability that is in our combat ships. We use it for the exchange of vital
     warfare information. If you look at how the operations were run in Kosovo, we don't have high-level meetings anymore, what
     we have is high-level collaborations with people at dispersed locations. The IT21 program allows us to do that from ships at sea.
     At the tactical level, we share information to bring combat power to bear via very high-quality data links, and that's the system by
     which we commit weapons and move forces.

     Q - How much has all this cost?

     A - It's been expensive (more than $1 billion over the last few years). However, the return on the investment has been enormous.
     And of course we don't measure return on investment the way stockholders do, we measure it in terms of increased combat
     power, and that's become very obvious to us.

     Q - What have been the changes in the third aspect, the way you live?

     A - We have wonderful experiences from our sailors deployed around the world, gone from home for extended periods of time,
     and now they are connected to their families on a daily basis. You have mitigated the great sense of loneliness. And, in fact,
     we've found that the retention rates among our sailors who are deployed in this modern technological environment are in fact
     higher than in the ships where we haven't been able to implement that kind of environment yet.

     Q - What kind of access do the sailors have to the technology?

     A - A few years ago, we deployed our first ship that had the capability of sending e-mail. We were so excited about that, that we
     actually counted the number of e-mails sent, and the number grew into the thousands. The Enterprise battle group recently
     returned from a long deployment, and they stopped counting e-mails past 5 million. It's no longer considered a novelty, it's just a
     fact of life.

     Q - How far along are you in implementing this across the Navy?

     A - By the end of 2001, we will have implemented the Navy-Marine Corps intranet. By the end of 2003, all of the ships in the
     Navy will have a very robust IT capability.

     Q - How did the previous system compare to what you're trying to put in now?

     A - It's not even a matter of saying it was a system. What you really had was a collection of capabilities that lacked
     standardization, interoperability, capacity. For example, one of the great concerns in combat is what's euphemistically called
     ``friendly fire'' (when an armed force accidentally kills one of its own). Of course, we don't like friendly fire. And information
     technology in the form of modern tactical data links (is) one of the most important tools to suppressing friendly fire. That's just
     one of the places where in our studies and in our war games, we can see the payoffs of information technology.

     Q - How much have things changed since the last all-out war in the Persian Gulf?

     A - The Persian Gulf War, looking back, quite frankly looks quite a bit like the Stone Age. I was commanding the USS Midway,
     where we had two telephones with off-ship capability. And it's hard to imagine that today. Some of our aircraft carriers have a
     thousand seats (for communicating). The quality of planning can go up a great deal, and you can plan much faster. For example,
     to put together a plan for fleet movement, a major evolution would frequently take a day or two. Now that kind of planning is
     done in an hour or even less. It's no longer plan, then execute -- it's plan while executing.

     Q - And the billion-dollar question: Are these systems ready for Y2K?

     A - I don't think we'll have a hiccup in Y2K as far as military systems.

      Gateway is finnally doing something with the 47 Amiga
      patents it bought several years ago. They aren't
      planning on introducing a new PC but instead want to
      use the technology to create info appliances.

      Gateway to revive Amiga
      for information appliances
                                                           By Gary McWilliams
                                                        THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

      Aug. 12 ù Two years ago, PC maker Gateway Inc.
      acquired the rights to the personal-computer
      industryÆs most famous cult product, the Amiga
      PC. The Amiga made its debut in 1985, and still
      has fans, partly as a result of a James Dean-like
      history: a rapid rise, then a tragic end.
      
     GATEWAY PAID ABOUT $13 MILLION for 47
     Amiga patents, including those for important multimedia
     techniques. The San Diego PC makerÆs original plan was to
     use the patents as a bargaining chip in royalty negotiations
     with other PC makers. ôIt was a treasure chest,ö says Joe
     Torre, a former Amiga Inc. hardware engineer.
            Now, Gateway is aiming to revive the Amiga in a bold
     move to set standards for the next era in computing. It
     quietly has set up and staffed a new Amiga Inc. subsidiary
     to cobble together low-cost ôinformation appliancesö for the
     Internet, based on Amiga technology, that can be linked like
     home-stereo components to add features.
            ôThereÆs a new computer revolution on the horizon that
     has to do with making computers a natural part of everyday
     life,ö says James Collas, the Amiga unitÆs president and a
     former Gateway executive. He says the unit will craft
     everything from digital-music players and game machines to
     wireless tablets that link to the Internet. Its first products
     could arrive early next year and be priced from about $100
     for game players to $1,000 for PC servers.
            Gateway will pit its tiny subsidiary against PC kingpins
     such as Microsoft Corp. and consumer-electronics
     companies such as Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics NV,
     which also are developing new-age information devices.
     Mr. Collas says Amiga will license its designs to
     consumer-electronics makers to promote technologies that
     can be embraced far beyond its parent.
            It could use all the help he can muster. Early entrants in
     the computer-consumer electronics convergence market,
     such as WebTV, were gobbled up quickly by the giants
     (Microsoft bought WebTV). Even for a company with $7.5
     billion in sales, the risks are high for Gateway. ôItÆs
     becoming a battle for the big boys,ö says Sean Kaldor, a
     researcher at International Data Corp. 

            How much of the new Amiga will come from its past
     isnÆt known. Mr. Collas has recruited designers from
     AmigaÆs heyday along with software specialists from Silicon
     Graphics Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. Amiga, he says,
     will operate independently from its parent, and be free to
     strike its own agreements. Mr. Collas wouldnÆt say if
     Gateway plans to spin off the subsidiary. A Gateway
     spokesman declined to comment.
            Among the San Diego divisionÆs first products will be a
     new Amiga PC that Mr. Collas says is aimed to bring
     Amiga PC software writers back into the fold. Next week,
     the company plans to release a new version of the Amiga
     operating system that provides access to the Internet.
            The Amiga is nothing if not resilient. It first appeared 14
     years ago as a spunky alternative to the IBM PC and
     AppleÆs Macintosh. Graphics and film enthusiasts flocked to
     the machine because of its ability to handle video and
     sound. Commodore Electronics Ltd. sold five million of the
     low-cost machines before the companyÆs sudden demise.
     Even today, Hollywood animators and filmmakers still use
     the machines for generating special effects.
            Amiga went into decline after Commodore filed for
     bankruptcy in 1994, and stopped making the machines. The
     first attempt to resurrect Amiga came in 1995, when
     German computer maker Escom AG acquired the
     Commodore patents in a bidding contest with Dell
     Computer Corp. But, like Commodore, Escom filed for
     bankruptcy a year later, and manufacturing was halted
     again. Amiga devotees became scavengers, scouring online
     bulletin boards for used machines and add-on parts.
     Indeed, there are dozens of tiny companies still living off the
     Amiga accessory market. 

            If the new Amiga ever catches on, it will be an Amiga
     in name only for some of the machineÆs original devotees.
     Greg Scott, an Amiga fan who manages the computer
     systems for Archtech Inc., a computer firm in London,
     Ontario, says GatewayÆs plan to develop the
     next-generation Amiga PC using the free Linux operating
     software has raised the hackles of fans of the old Amiga.
     ôItÆs nothing new,ö he says.
            Jason Compton, who owns an Amiga and once ran an
     online Amiga magazine, still believes nothing can match the
     original. ôIÆve never seen a PC IÆve enjoyed more.ö He says
     the Gateway plan does little more than resurrect the Amiga
     name. ôAs far as I can tell, thereÆs no connectionö to the
     original technology, he says.
            Mr. Collas says such qualms are missing the spirit of
     the old Amiga. It isnÆt new technology thatÆs needed so
     much as an innovative blending of existing technologies, he
     insists. Just as the Amiga PCÆs low cost and ease of use
     allowed owners to do multimedia work years ahead of the
     IBM PC, he says the new Amiga ôwill bring the information
     age to the common person.ö

      Not found-- the problem with ISPs
                                        and security web sites


     CyberChrist
     cc@h0use.org
     "Sapere Aude"

     Over the last few months, there have been a rash of
     security-related web sites taken offline for a peculiar
     reason-- It seems that Internet Service Providers cave in
     to the demands of people objecting to the content of the
     site, or at times, the alledged content. Sites such as
     Packetstorm Security have been victim of people claiming
     that material that is posted on the web site is libelous and
     try to hold the service provider of the web site, such as
     the web hosting organization, for ransom by threatening
     them with lawsuits if they do not force the webmaster to
     change the content. Companies are more willing to just
     toss the offending site off of its servers and avoid any
     kind of threat of a lawsuit. However, this is not the way
     to deal with this problem, as there have been precedents
     set in American courts that deal specifically with these
     issues. 

     First, let's examine a bit as to how a "security expert" or a
     "hacker" is viewed by a typical ISP. Most ISPs have a
     service agreement, where one agrees to abide by their
     rules. These rules often lay out the rules as to what
     content is acceptable and not acceptable. Many of these
     ISPs forbid the posting of security information on their
     web servers, lumping "hacking" in with "pornography" and
     other perceived underground activities. This lumping of
     hacking with other, seedier activities is prevalent and is
     part of the problem. No matter what the credentials are of
     the person that is constructing the web site and no
     matter what his stated intentions are, and no matter how
     many disclaimers are posted on the site, web hosting
     companies and ISPs generally frown upon that kind of
     content. So part of the problem is that ISPs and web
     hosting companies are generally undereducated about the
     entire hacker culture, their brains fattened by the massive
     FUD articles posted in the media. 

     In their minds, security consultants==hackers=bad. 

     This leads to another problem-- there is always going to
     be someone out there that is jealous or mad about the
     content of another web site. The site may contain
     information such as "xyz said this and xyz is wrong and
     this is why." Sites such as these either start posting
     about each other, or worse, one webmaster just gets fed
     up with it and contacts someone that they feel can
     remedy the situation. Often this person forgets about the
     chain of command as far as reporting questionable
     material and goes straight for the throat by contacting
     the web site's upstream provider. This is becoming an
     increasing problem and the problem again lies in the fact
     that many of these fly-by-night web masters were not
     around during the infancy of the Internet (no, that does
     not mean that the infancy was when then web got
     started). There ARE rules of engagement and chains of
     command, and these have been outlined since the early
     80s and perhaps beyond, both in the form of RFCs and
     tradition. The way that complaints used to be handled are
     roughly as follows: 

     - send email to the system administrator of the offending
     system, calmly explaining the situation and maybe offer
     some evidence as to how this is causing harm. This could
     be due to content or due to other activity coming from
     the site, such as port scanning. Attaching logs usually
     helps a lot.
     - if you don't get a response in a reasonable amount of
     time, try re-sending the email. It may seem hard to
     believe, but sometimes mail gets lost.
     - if there is still no response, try doing a 'whois' on their
     domain name, and then try contacting them via the
     information provided. Usually you get names and
     telephone numbers and addresses at this point.
     - it is only when you have exhausted all of these
     measures and are getting no cooperation or hostile
     responses that you try to contact the upstream service
     provider. To find out who their upstream service provider
     is, try looking at the nameservers that are registered for
     the domain in the 'whois' command or try doing a
     traceroute and seeing who they have their connection
     from. 

     This is really common sense more than anything. Common
     sense apparently has gone out the window in the
     point-and-click world of the 1990s. 

     The last part of the puzzle is what happens when these
     two uneducated sides get together to decide what to do
     about someone that seems to know more than they do.
     More often than not, what happens is the illogical in that
     the offending party is tossed off the system or his
     upstream provider threatens to shut down the service.
     The cycle usually goes like this: 

     - siteA.com posts information that shows that information
     by lamerA is wrong. siteA.com pokes fun at him, generally
     ridicules him, and the cycle usually renews itself when
     lamerA says something else stupid (or publishes an idiotic
     book).
     - lamerA feels stung by all these statements and usually
     responds with weak defenses. Finally, the whole thing
     becomes unbearable and in the search of trying to get the
     activity to stop, he dashes to siteA.com's service provider
     and tells them that siteA.com has libelous material. lamerA
     threatens the service provider with a lawsuit or
     thereabouts.
     - siteA.com's provider panicks, as they do not wish to be
     sued for libel (awards for this are usually extravagant and
     ISPs barely break even as it is). So they either remove
     the site or forcibly remove the content and sends stern
     rebukes to siteA.com's administrator/user. 

     There are a lot of problems with this cycle. Obviously the
     chain of command is broken. But more importantly, due to
     lack of education on the ISP's part, they are not aware
     that U.S. courts have decided that ISPs are NOT liable for
     the content of its users. In November of 1998, The United
     States Court of Appeals in Florida ruled against a woman
     who sued America Online when one of its subscribers, a
     convicted sex offender, approached her 11-year-old son
     via an America Online chat group. The appeals court
     upheld a federal law that protects Internet service
     providers and online services from inappropriate online
     transmittals by subscribers. The verdict is being appealed
     to the United States Supreme Court. This decision also
     extends to web content. Rather than cite the case to the
     accuser, the service provider usually caves in quickly and
     pulls the plug. 

     There are many other cases that ISPs can cite in their
     defense. Zeran vs. America Online in 1998 was upheld by
     the U.S. Supreme Court. It stated simply that ISPs such
     as America Online are free from liabilitynover material that
     is carried on their network. Furthermore, the Supreme
     Court stated that ISPs do not have a duty nor an
     obligation to remove material found to be offensive. The
     decision cited the Communications Decency Act of 1996,
     where ISPs are shown not to be publishers and thus are
     not treated as such by the law. 

     Another case is Cubby vs. Compuserve. In this case, the
     ruling cleared CompuServe of any wrongdoing based on
     the content of one of its subscribers, stating that ISPs
     such as CompuServe are secondary publishers, merely
     providing the means by which documents may be viewed
     and had no editorial control over any of the content
     published on its public web servers. At the most, it
     removes any kind of offensive material after conplaints.
     Hence, it cannot be held liable for content since it had no
     previous knowledge of the content. 

     Interestingly enough, one of the key elements that can
     help protect security consultants from being run off from a
     service provider or that can help a service provider to deal
     with complaints is the Communications Decency Act of
     1996. It contains clear language that clearly states that
     "no provider or user of an interactive computer service
     shall be treated as a publisher or speaker of any
     information provided by another." The key is to realize
     that as a service provider being threatened with lawsuits
     over content that is found to be defamatory, your
     company is NOT liable for the content being published by
     one of your users. That is the law of the land and by
     citing these cases to any irate callers, you may be able to
     diffuse the situation in a more diplomatic manner than just
     booting the offending site off your server or off your
     router. Remember that these laws also theoretically work
     in inverse-- if you boot users from your system without
     warning and you state that the material could get the ISP
     sued, you could be sued by the user you just booted for
     wrongful termination. And if the user can show loss of
     business over this wrongful termination, the ISP could
     have more problems in its hands than it bargained for. 

     I should be noticed that although ISPs cannot be held
     liable, users of the system that are publishing the
     questionable information CAN be held liable. However, a
     clear case must be made in court to show that the
     information is erroneous and has caused emotional and
     financial distress to the plaintiff. 

     In conclusion, it has been shown that the problems that
     arise in today's trend of booting "questionable" security
     sites from servers or from routers arises mainly from a
     complete lack of education on all sides as to the way that
     these problems are to be approached. The problems are
     not only in the complete diregard of the
     chain-of-command in reporting a problem, but ultimately
     also lies in the total lack of education on the part of the
     ISP in knowing what its rights are as defined by the
     American Judicial System. ISPs of any kind seem quick to
     cave in to the demands of an irate complaint and do not
     seem to fully think of the situation at hand and think of
     the legal precedents of these kinds of complaints without
     executing a rash decision that does nothing but give other
     would-be-complainers hope that they can also get a web
     site or web server removed if they complain long enough
     to their provider. If the rash of sites being taken down by
     these uneducated people is to stop, then all sides need to
     be aware of the protocols that are involved in dealing with
     these problems and the legal cases that support their
     decisions.

      Introduction 
    
      Today, when too many people think of security on the Internet, they think of individual hosts and networks. Alone. Got a problem?
      Damn! Must be those damn hacker punks. Again. Keep it to yourself. Call the Feds, call the New York Times. Make sure we don't get
      it. Didn't keep your systems patched? Moron. Don't make us sue you. 
    
      With the growing irrelevance of security organizations like CERT and law enforcement on the Internet, an ever growing number of
      attacks are handled in isolation. 
    
      Hundreds of millions of Internet users around the world have become accustomed to an Internet beyond boundaries. One site flows to
      the next, a jungle of software, protocols, media and people connecting, signal, noise, mixing, evolving, together. 
    
      It seems silly to ignore the security of the system _as a whole_, but we still do. A helpful analogy might be to consider the Internet
      more a living organism than a neighborhood. A security compromise is can behave more like a disease then a "break-in". It is often
      contagious and can spread. Remotely exploitable security vulnerabilities are like the natural wounds of the skin. They are relatively
      rare, sometimes difficult to squirm through, but once inside, infection can begin. 
    
      This article describes the efforts of a small, independent, security research group to audit some 36 million hosts connected to the
      Internet, for commonly known security vulnerabilities in an unfocused low-res scan. 
    
      Why? 
    
      Because we're a curious bunch, because we've been speculating (rather academicly) over the results for several years, and of
      course, because we can. 
    
      Why are we publishing now, Why haven't we published before? 
    
      We know other groups, working for everyone from the UKUSA SIGINT agencies, foreign intelligence, private corporations and
      organized crime are not likely, for many obvious reasons, to disclose any "privileged information" to the general public. We feel this is
      not A Good Thing, and would like to do what we can to help level the playing field. We don't have any money, resources or academic
      prestige to back us up, but we do have a few, humble insights to share, and we hope these can speak for themselves. 
    
      Besides, wouldn't it be a shame to keep all of our busy work to ourselves, when it could be reaching a much wider audience, spark
      debate, and maybe even making a difference? 
    
      Up until now, a couple of issues have held us back. First of all, the timeless responsibility factor. We could not avoid the possibility
      (certainty?) that our work would be abused by malicious parties and we've all seen before how easy it is for people to point the finger. 
    
      Secondly, we've been busy and publishing involves a significant investment in time writing articles, cleaning code, reaching the
      potential audience and reading (sometimes answering) endless e-mails. 
    
      Walk forth in dread 
    
      So you want to scan the millions of computers on the Internet from Japan to Egypt to Florida? Reach out and audit the networks of
      Internet Service Providers, corporations, universities, government facilities, banks and sensitive military installations? 
    
      First, take another moment to think about it. 
    
      Many people get nervous on the receiving end of an uninvited security audit, and you'll eventually step on quite a few toes. In some
      countries, you can even expect unpleasant house-calls from local law enforcement which will brand you a criminal for your unusual
      efforts. Citizens of a large democracy with many three letter agencies should be aware that a fully-equipped SWAT team is likely to tag
      along. 
    
      While this may deter, possibly comfort law-abiding readers, a criminally inclined party is not without it's options. Resources are
      abundant on the Internet, and many suitable, unsuspecting, high-bandwidth volunteers are not hard to find, with the modest help of
      your favorite bulk auditing software. 
    
      Not intimidated? That's the spirit! 
    
      Quick & Dirty Overview 
    
      Let's take a look at some of the basic ingredients we're going to need: 
        1.Some wheels. (BASS, a Bulk Auditing Security Scanner) 
        2.A map. (address search space) 
        3.Fuel. (resources) 
    
     Although they are not required, logistical management skills, competence and patience can also come in real handy. 
    
     Wheels 
    
     The Internet is getting rather big these days, and exploring it's tens of millions of unique hosts is by no means an easy task. Manually, we
     could never get the job done. Fortunately, we can let a computer (or several) do most of the dirty work, allowing us to concentrate on
     coordination and management. 
    
     Assuming of course, we have the right software. In this case, we're going to need a robust bulk security scanner that can monotonicly run
     for weeks, even months at a time, efficiently processing millions of addresses, generating gigabytes of traffic and surviving everything
     from broken routing, to system shutdowns and unfriendly sysadmins. 
    
     Since we've never liked re-inventing the wheel, the first thing we did, (circa Sep 1998) was take a look at existing scanning software. 
    
     We were disappointed. There was no shortage of software, from Satan, to Nessus, with a jungle of (often silly) cracker tools in between,
     but none of them would do. Nessus was impressive, but clearly not designed with bulk in mind. Most of the rest were unreliable, poorly
     written, slow and inextensible. Primitive, specialized scanners (foobar-scan) were also common, and equally useless. 
    
     So, it looked like we'd need to write "Yet Another Security Scanner" ourselves. 
    
     During development, we were careful not to complicate the design and code any more then we had to, aware of the many virtues of
     simplicity (especially in security software). Our goal was producing a scanner which was reliable, efficient and extensible. 
    
     After a several weeks of on-off programming, the first alpha version of BASS, the Bulk Auditing Security Scanner was ready for it's first
     test run. Israel was the first target in a series of trials. 
    
     At this point (Sep-Oct 98) BASS could only identify 4 common security vulnerabilities, but adding more later was a simple matter. What we
     really needed to evaluate was how well the multi-threaded scanning architecture worked. 
    
     "beware the bugs that bite beta programs" 
    
     It didn't. Even with a small target like Israel, the scan came to a final halt after about 18,000 addresses. It seemed threads would
     occasionally freeze, waiting for service from a host they knew was online, but behind a misconfigured firewall, or a broken router. The
     frozen threads were rare but persistent. They would build up in BASS's scheduler over time, eventually choking the scanner to a grinding
     halt. 
    
     A fail-safe timeout circuit fixed the problem, and we tried again. This time, the scan finished on schedule. 110,000 addresses in under 4
     hours, on a dual ISDN 128k connection. 
    
     We selected the United Kingdom, with an address space of 1.4 million, for our next trial. If there were any further bugs, they were going to
     show, and they did. Around a million UK addresses later, BASS broke down and was dragging the entire system down with it. This time,
     several obscure memory leaks had slowly inflated BASS to monstrous proportions, consuming all available system memory. Several
     further painful debugging sessions were needed to bring the scanner up to par, during which 5 million addresses around the world had
     been scanned. 
    
     Now that the architecture was stable, we proceeded to familiarizing BASS with the wonders of CGI and RPC, allowing the scanner to test
     for up to 18 widely known security vulnerabilities (see detailed listing in suffix item 1). The tests were designed to reduce false positives
     and false negatives to a minimum, combining passive (server's version header) and interactive (server's response to ill-formed input: a
     buffer-overflow, sneaky characters) implementation signatures to determine vulnerability. 
    
     So now we could sit back, feed BASS a really big map of the Internet, and wait a few months (or weeks, depending on our resources) for
     results. 
    
     Download the BASS scanner source code. 
    
     A map. 
    
     - A map you say? 
    
     Yeah, well what I really mean is a really long list of "all" the computers connected to the Internet. Please note the term "all" is used loosely
     ("most" or the "majority" would probably be more accurate). 
    
     - How many of them are there anyway? 
    
     Reader, that's a tougher question then you might think. 
    
     An Internet Protocol address, or IP for short, is a 32 bit integer. This means are there 2^32 (4.3 billion) possible unique IPs, the IP
     address space. In practice, only a very small fraction of this space is really used. 
    
     Due to the anarchic nature of the Internet, nobody has any exact figures on usage statistics, but most estimates (circa Jan 1999) settle
     around 100 million users worldwide. The number of computers online is more around an order of a magnitude lower (15 million). This is
     because most users still access the Internet dynamicly, by dialup, over phone lines. ISPs (Internet Service Providers) can often manage
     to provide service with an address pool 4 to 10 times smaller then their customer base. 
    
     Ideally, since BASS is (currently) Unix oriented, we would like to eliminate any non-unix computers (not that non-unix's are any more
     secure, quite the contrary) from our Really Big List. We would also want to skip any dynamic IP pools. In a perfect world, this would be a
     good idea. In ours, eliminating poor scanning candidates in advance would actually take longer then the scan itself. Optimizing a scan this
     way is only useful if you plan on repeating it frequently. 
    
     - I'm confused, how many IPs are we going to end up scanning? 
    
     That depends,.. 
    
     In our case, we ended up scanning around 36 million IPs, which we estimates covered 85 percent of the active address space at the time.
    
     Keep in mind, however, that the Internet is growing very quickly, so these numbers will get bigger by the time you try this out yourself.
     Search for "Internet Surveys" on the web, and get an updated figure. 
    
     - Wait, what's with the 85 percent? 
    
     Calm down, mapping the entire used IP space is nearly impossible, even assuming you can agree with anyone else (try Usenet folks
     first!) on what "used" should mean. The main problem is using an IP is an internal decision organizations with an allocated slice of the
     address space makes for themselves. All those slices add up to 300 million IP addresses, of which only 5 percent have a computer at the
     other end, so we need to narrow down our search space. 
    
     This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) comes to the rescue. The DNS is a tree structured lookup directory used (primarily) to
     map a hostname to an IP and vice-versa (www.nsa.gov <=> 208.212.172.33). By convention, most of the Internet's active addresses are
     registered with the DNS, although this is a not a mandatory requirement. 
    
     - So we can just download the DNS's records from the Internet? 
    
     Yes, and no. The DNS protocol has an "AXFR zone transfer" mechanism designed to allow one DNS server to mirror the contents of
     another, by requesting an AXFR zone transfer, you can download a server's records. This is helpful in providing for redundant backups,
     should the primary server fail. Unfortunately, since the DNS is a distributed system, we can't just download it's complete contents from any
     central authority. 
    
     To make matters worse, many DNS servers nowadays (40 percent) refuse zone transfer requests, due to several (misunderstood)
     concerns over it's security implications. 
    
     - Sounds rough. 
    
     Well if you're going the do-it-yourself way, it's not going to be easy, but isn't as difficult as it sounds. 
    
     Let's take a look at some of our options (If you aren't the do-it-yourself type, skip to item 4): 
    
       1.A top - down recursive download of the DNS. 
    
          Using the DNS protocol's AXFR zone-transfer mechanism it is possible to recursively download the DNS's contents one zone at a
          time. In practice however, this method is usually reserved for mapping a known target that has not explicitly restricted
          zone-transfers. 
    
          Trying to map the DNS this way has the disadvantage of being slow, unreliable and incomplete. 
    
          A description of process is available in RFC1296. 
    
       2.Exploiting in-addr.arpa. 
    
          We start off by recursively downloading the DNS's relatively small in-addr.arpa. domain. This will give us the allocated address
          space (300 million IPs). Most of the active addresses (the ones we want) in this space will have a PTR record somewhere in the
          in-addr.arpa domain. (so they can be mapped in reverse from IP numbers to hostnames). Many Internet protocols and applications
          rely on this pointer, by convention, so it is not likely to be absent on purpose. Unless the address isn't being used, of course, but
          we don't want any of those anyway. By checking to see which IPs in the allocated address space have a pointer in the
          in-addra.arpa. domain, we can narrow down the search space to about 13 percent (45 million IPs). 
    
          This process demonstrates that the ever popular practice of blocking zone-transfers will not hide a network's topology. People
          relying on this method to obscure their security problems are begging for trouble. 
    
          BTW, 'Network Wizards' are doing their Internet Survey this way, since the beginning of 1998, check them out. (http://www.nw.com/)
    
          The job is likely to take between a week, and a month (or several), depending on how much available bandwidth you have, and the
          quality of the software your using to get it done. 
    
       3.Scavenging Network Information Centers for pre-compiled lists. 
    
          It turns out some NICs have precompiled data files available over anonymous FTP. Getting the data this way is much easier, faster
          and more reliable then slowly milking the DNS through the traditional AXFR zone-transfer protocol. 
    
          As of Nov 1998, RIPE (ftp.ripe.net) was offering raw output files from it's recursive hostcount (Covering Europe, Russia and others.
          98 countries in total) for download at ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/hostcount. 
    
          Update: On the 01/02/1999 they restricted anonymous FTP access to the raw hostcount output files. You now have to either
          convince RIPE you really need them at hostcount@ripe.net (for saving the world, no less) or grab them at one of RIPE's many
          mirrors. 
    
          Network Wizards, the guys doing the Internet Survey, offer (some) of the raw data from their older surveys, up to 1997, at
          "http://www.isc.org/ISC_HTML/domainsurvey/archive-data/". 
    
          ARIN (http://www.arin.net), the American Registry for Internet Numbers, is an interesting site to look into. While your reading
          exciting new number policies, grab ftp.arin.net/domain/inaddr.zone over anonymous FTP. (doing a zone-transfer take's so much
          longer) 
    
          There are hundreds of NICs, structured hierarchicly. Search the web for "Network Information Centers", and you'll find quite a few.
          APNIC (Asian Pacific) and JPNIC (Japan's NIC at NIC.ad.jp) are two you should really look into. 
    
          Then there's InterNIC, run by Network Solutions (NSI, the "dot com" guys), in charge of the root servers,
          ([A-M].ROOT-SERVERS.NET), at the root of Internet's DNS, all the three letter top level domains (com, net, org, edu, gov and mil)
          and the top level in-addr.arpa. domain (for reverse lookups). InterNIC is the closest thing the Internet has to a central authority on
          anything, and is currently being run as a lucrative for-profit US-government sanctioned monopoly. InterNIC no longer provides
          anonymous FTP access to most of it's DNS records, with the exception of the top-level in-addr.arpa. domain, stating it is trying to
          prevent spammers and squatters (domain name speculators) from abusing the DNS. As such, InterNIC will only offer FTP access to
          "organizations that can demonstrate a technical need for the information". 
    
          Fortunately, the information is already out there, available on several anonymous FTP sites hosted by InterNIC affiliates
          (government, military, educational,. etc) who share it's records, but do not enforce it's censorship policies. 
    
          Personally, we downloaded the top level .com, .net, .org, .edu, .mil and .gov domains from ftp.nic.mil (the first NIC we tried) several
          minutes after a disappointing encounter with an almost empty 'domains' directory at ftp.internic.net. (Update: ftp.nic.mil no longer
          provides these records over anon FTP) 
    
       4.The Greener Path 
    
          The Internet Software Consortium (http://www.isc.org), of the bi-annual "Internet Survey", is offering it's raw data sets for resale
          through MIDS, Matrix Information and Directory Services (http://www.mids.org) at $2500. 
    
          Frankly, shelling the green is alot easier, faster and even less expensive then trying to compile the data yourself, especially if you
          don't already have the software, expertise and bandwidth to pull it off. 
    
     - What about you guys? What did you do? 
    
     We like banging our heads against the wall, so we went down the slippery do-it-yourself path. 
    
     We started off by learning as much as we could about the DNS, reading any RFCs that were relevant to the protocol, browsed through
     the documentation of it's most popular implementation "BIND", downloaded a zoo of freely available DNS utilities from the major FTP sites
     and read lots of source code. 
    
     Eventually we ended up hacking a couple of popular DNS utilities, wrote way too many ugly shell scripts, C application wrappers, and
     some pretty silly Perl filters, mixing alot of method 3 (scavenging), 2 (in-addr.arpa.) and just a bit of 1 (vanilla zone-transfers). 
    
     If you have any good sense, you'll do otherwise. 
    
     Fuel 
    
     Swarming the Internet with probes requires some resources, bandwidth mostly. How much of it you need depends on how flexible your
     schedule is. Generally speaking, You're likely to find you need a lot less of it then you might first imagine. 
    
     The good news is that scans are easy to parallelize, so you can divide the load over as many different computers and networks as you
     have access to, to either get the scan finished faster, or to consume fewer resources from each participating scanning node. This is
     similar logisticly to the distributed computing effort used to break a cryptographic key challenge. The difference is that our effort
     consumes network bandwidth instead of CPU cycles, and is much much easier. 
    
     How much easier? (Assuming a search space of 40 million IPs...) 
    
     One workstation running BASS, with enough memory (to support hundreds of scanning threads), and a T3's equivalence in bandwidth,
     could probe the entire Internet in under a week at about 4500 JPM. (Jobs Per Minute, the scanner's schedule goal, set on the command
     line at the beginning of a scanning session, or during recovery). 
    
     At the other extreme, a small disperse group, running BASS on 10 personal computers with dailup-strength connections, could probe the
     entire Internet in a month or so at a modest 90 JPM each. (around 2 kilobytes/second). 
    
     A minor detour, introducing IDDN. (the International Digital Defense Network) 
    
     All of this brings us to an interesting idea we've been playing around with that could dramaticly influence Internet security for the good, if /
     when it is eventually implemented. Frankly, the idea deserves an article of it's own, but since we are so busy, we will introduce it here. 
    
     Inspired by the high response to cryptographic key challenges, distributed.net and the SETI effort, we vision a non-profit foundation,
     which we like to ambitiously call IDDN, the International Digital Defense Network, working in the public interest to organize massively
     distributed scanning efforts which routinely probe the Internet for security vulnerabilities. 10,000 participants could finish a scan cycle
     every 2-3 days at an insignificant, single JPM each. At the end of a cycle, an automated system could draw the attention of administrators
     worldwide to some of their local security problems, and offer whatever information and solutions (bug-fixes, patches, workarounds) it has
     on database (patches, advisories, exploits). In our opinion, such an effort is highly practical and could contribute more to the stability and
     security of the Internet then the traditional (somewhat pointless?) bruteforce crypto key challenges. We believe organizing an Internet
     neighborhood-watch of sorts is in everyone's interests, especially the Internet's commercial industry which depend on the Internet to
     eventually fulfill it's potential for global electronic commerce. 
    
     We do not have the time or resources to get the IDDN off the drawing board by ourselves and would be interested in the community's
     input on this issue. 
    
     Let the show begin 
    
     Tuesday, 1 December 1998. 
    
     We've installed BASS on 8 Unix boxes around the world, each with at least 512kbps bandwidth. 8 different geographicly located
     participants in 5 different countries: Israel(1), Mexico(1), Russia(2), Japan(2) and Brazil(2). 
    
     Two machines have already proven their strength during the scanner's painful debugging sessions. Three more will join them for the first
     time when we begin. The others are backups, ready in case anything goes wrong, and frankly, we have some concerns. 
    
     Mostly, we expect the scan to raise some complaints, especially passing through the Internet's sensitive military, government and private
     networks, where snooping around is nothing short of a shooting offense, the prelude to a fullblown attack. Our probes 'come in peace', so
     to speak, but how can they know? They'll perceive us as a threat and could very well retaliate. 
    
     We want the scan over before the new year, so we've set BASS's schedulers to finish in 3 weeks, at 250 JPM x 5. If all goes well, we'll be
     going over the results in the last week of 1998. If not, we'll have an extra week (at least) to fix whatever comes up and still be on
     schedule. 
    
     An interesting point to note is how we've constructed the search space. We'll cover the domains by size, starting with the smaller domains
     first, so by the first week we'll have finished scanning 216 of the 228 active domains in the DNS (*.org, *.gov, *.int, and 212 countries,
     from Afghanistan with 1 host to the UK with 1.4 million). We create the individual search space of each participant by dividing the global
     space the same way you would deal a deck of cards, so that the original scanning order is preserved. 
    
     At 02:00 GMT, we flip the switch, so to speak, activating BASS on the five participating hosts. Since these have all been configured to
     automaticly recover from any power failure or unexpected system shutdowns, we really don't have much to do now, besides keeping a
     lazy eye on progress. 
    
     First week 
    
     There is definitely a response out there to the scan, but it's much friendlier then we anticipated. Harmless acts of mindless automata and
     mutual curiosity, mostly. Pings, traceroutes, telnet sessions and finger attempts. Four to eight portscans a day. An occasional TCP/IP
     stack exercise, an OS fingerprint, a few mostly polite e-mails asking why our network was "attacking" theirs, frequently warning us that
     crackers may be abusing our systems, suggesting we look into it. Very mild, we are running into much less hostility then we expected. 
    
     People either don't realize the scope of the scan, or don't care. On an individual basis, one quick security probe isn't usually enough to
     get the local sysadmin to notice. Those who do are probably security conscious enough to keep their networks up to date anyway, and
     confident enough to keep their cool when yet another 13 year old punk (who else?) bangs on their network walls. 
    
     Oh, did we mention the scanner is precisely on schedule? 12 million hosts scanned by the end of the week, covering the US
     government's *.gov domain, Canada, Australia, Europe, and a window to some of the most intriguing corners of the world: Hostile
     mind-control regimes like China and Iran for example, which suffocate their repressed population's access to free ideas and information,
     but are still paradoxicly connected (albeit, very poorly) to the Internet. Third world potentials like India (the world's largest democracy!)
     and the rapidly developing countries of the far east. Exotic paradise locations like the Cocos Islands, Bahamas, the Virgin Islands,
     Barbados, Fiji, and Micronesia All of them as close and accessible as if they were right across the street, and in a certain way even
     closer. Computer expertise is rare in many of these countries, security expertise even rarer. Cracking into a Chinese computer half a
     world away, for example, is usually easier, more interesting, and safer (assuming you are not in Chinese jurisdiction of course) then
     cracking into a comparable western computer. 
    
     As a precaution, all eight participants have backed up the 13 MBs worth of precious results, to make sure an emergency relocation
     recovery is possible, should this become necessary. 
    
     (I.e, in case of a small thermonuclear attack on one or more scanning participants, possibly effecting their performance. Caution, nuclear
     warfare can really ruin your entire scan) 
    
     Second week 
    
     We started the week off by scanning US Military networks. Admitingly, we were pretty nervous, and spent much of the day keeping an eye
     out for telltale signs of a pissed off military retaliation (also known as "InfoWar" and "spooky shit" in professional terminology). 
    
     In just under 24 hours it was all over, and while we did notice a significant increase in the number of probes we were getting, to say we
     were not impressed by the security of the military network is a big fat major understatement. This might not be a problem, since according
     to NSCS (National Computer Security Center) network security policies, none of the systems on the public *.mil network could qualify for
     the storage and handling of classified DoD (Department of Defense) information. How strictly these policies are adhered to is another
     matter. And even if they are (and this is a _big_ if), the DoD is still (justifiably) concerned that crackers might glue together classified
     information from the little pieces of unclassified information fragments lying around their *.mil network (in great abundance). So they have
     plenty of good reasons to keep their network secure, but are (un)?fortunately doing a pretty lousy job. 
    
     DoS six o'clock. 
    
     Wednesday, our Russian scanner runs into trouble. A denial of service attack, 512kbps stream of packets amplified 120 times strong
     over an unsuspecting Canadian broadcast amplifier. Half a world a way, the packet storm brings a large Russian ISP to it's knees,
     overwhelming it's available bandwidth. Ouch. 
    
     Apparently, we stepped on someone's toes. At first, we assumed this was somehow connected to yesterday's *.mil scan, but no, it was
     just some ill-tempered English fellow who didn't appreciate getting probed last Monday. He tried crashing our stack first, with some nasty
     DoS attacks for NT and Unix. That didn't work, so he blasted our ISP out of the sky. Clear and simple, he didn't want to, but we left him no
     choice. You can't have decent English folks being polked around at by some Russian punks ... 
    
     The attack lasted 16 hours straight, and since it wasn't too difficult to track down where it was coming from, we were very tempted to
     return the favor, or at least give this trigger-happy netizen a free security audit. 
    
     We didn't though, the net's resources are much too valuable to further waste on such brutish exhibition of ego (a "cyber" pissing
     contest?). Besides, an eye for an eye and everyone goes blind, right? 
    
     Anyway, one of our backups (also in Russia) quickly substituted for the lost computer as soon as we noticed the attack 6 hours later at
     255 JPM, with no other significant setbacks to our week's schedule. 
    
     The rest of the week chugged along nicely, scanning the United States (or more precisely, the *.us domain), Japan (*.jp), and the
     educational networks (*.edu). Hmmm, Has anyone noticed how unsymmetricly biased the DNS is in favor of the United States? Dot gov,
     dot mil, dot org, dot edu. Being so homogeneously American, shouldn't these go under the *.us domain? 
    
     "You're gonna rot in jail" - the legal corner 
    
     We've began receiving e-mail's this week by people with alot less tolerance for our activities, most in delayed response to last week's
     scans. Some of these were written by lawyers who informed us we were either supporting or perpetrating acts of computer crime against
     their clients. They had notified the authorities (CERT and the FBI were commonly cited) and threatened to take us to court if we did not
     offer our full cooperation in immediately identifying the attacking party. Right... 
    
     It seems some organizations hire fulltime "security officers" known for exaggerating the significance of petty incidents to justify getting
     payed. Unfortunately, in certain parts of the worlds, charges like these can cost you a fortune in legal defense, and with the wrong judge,
     a conviction, and a sentence anywhere between a large fine, and a few years in jail. Fortunately, on the Internet, getting around this is as
     easy as scanning from places which are not known for overzealousness in regard to their definition of "computer crime". This is just
     another example of how poorly the local and international legal system deals with so called "computer crime" and the Internet. 
    
     Under the (US) state of Oregon's computer crime law (164-377a), for example, we could definitely be defined as computer criminals,
     trailed and sent away to many years in prison. (But so could everyone else...) 
    
     A chosen excerpt from the law: 
    
      (4) Any person who knowingly and without authorization uses, accesses or attempts to access any computer, computer system,
      computer network, or any computer software, program, documentation or data contained in such computer, computer system or
      computer network, commits computer crime. 
    
     As you can see, the law is unreasonably vague. "Criminal" or not, it all comes down to your definition of "authorization". But, having it
     would constitute some sort of prior agreement between a user and the owners of a computer, computer network or computer software.
     The Internet however is a public network, and the majority of it's services are used anonymously, by users with which there is no
     persistent relationship. 
    
     In the physical world, any behavior is possible, so society enforces order by restricting behavior it finds unacceptable through the
     regulative government system, which is "programmed" by the code of the law. 
    
     The computer world is pure code, instructions and information, none of which are capable of discrimination. The computer programmer is
     the god of a perfectly obedient universe. Like the artist, the canvas of his creation is as expressive or inexpressive of his will and intention
     as he has made it to be. 
    
     This means software, like the law, can inherit the imperfections of it's creator. Poorly written computer and legal code can allow the
     system to behave in conflict with the original intentions of the men who wrote it. Legal loopholes and software bugs, Lawyers and
     Hackers, different sides of the same coin. The only way to really prevent the abuse of the system is to write better code. 
    
     This is the reason we find most "computer crime" legislation so absurd. The laws try to protect computer systems from being misused,
     when the only definitive expression of what constitutes "acceptable use" is in the code itself, which may or may not be a precise
     manifestation of the author's intentions, depending on his competence as a programmer. 
    
     If the public insists on "computer crime" legislation anyway, we believe most of the it's problems could be easily resolved by eliminating
     ambiguous wording, over generalization, and specificly breaking down what the law defines as acts of "computer crime": 
    
       1.knowingly exploiting a finite list of common misimplementations (bufferoverflow, a race condition, ...) 
       2.intentionally performing a Denial of Service attack. 
       3.wiretapping (sniffing a network, capturing keyboard strokes, screen content, etc.) 
       4.using a party's identification token[s] (username / password) without the party's permission. (logging into a system on someone
          elses account, reading someone else's email) 
       5.Spam. (death penalty for repeated offenders) 
    
     Note that we've removed "attempted" attacks from the offense list, since these are hard to define, prove, and cause no damage. 
    
     (If in the course of an attempted attack a system is damaged, in a denial of service attack for example, then we can prosecute this event
     as a separate incident, with nothing "attempted" about it) 
    
     Interested readers are advised to read up on the Oregon vs. Randal L. Schwartz case, a good example as to why Draconian "computer
     crime" legislation should be fought with a vengeance. (http://www.lightlink.com/fors) 
    
     Third week 
    
     Last week. Only the mammoth *.com and half of the *.net domain left and we're done. 
    
     they're heeeere... 
    
     Friday, our Japanese participants discover that a computer on their company network has been cracked into, one very secure Linux box
     running only SSH and Apache 1.3.4. Now this would definitely send a chill up your spine if you knew just how fanatic our friends are when
     it comes to network security. Furthermore, they only detected the intrusion three days after the fact, which is unbelievable when you
     consider the insane monitoring levels they've been keeping since they agreed to participate in the scan. They would have noticed any
     funny stuff, and in fact, they did, lots of it, but none of which came close enough to a security breach to raise any alarms. 
    
     Readers should also note how although a key binary in the cracked machine had been modified, tripwire and an assortment of other
     booby traps failed to detect this had happened. Even a close-up manual inspection (comparing file contents with a trusted backup,
     playing with it's name) could not detect any odd behavior. This trick, and others equally spooky were achieved by clever manipulation of
     the OS's kernel code (dynamicly, through a module). 
    
     Other characteristics of the attack which make it so eerily sophisticated: 
    
       1.The attacker (convincingly) masquerades as a local employee. 
    
          The attacker knows the employee's username and password and is even connecting through the employee's Japanese ISP on the
          employee's account! (the phone company identified this was an untraceable overseas caller) 
    
          This information could not have been sniffed, since network services are only provided over encrypted SSH sessions. 
    
          Further investigation shows that this employee's personal NT box, connected over a dynamic dailup connection, had been cracked
          into 4 days earlier. 
    
          His ssh client (TTSSH extension to TeraTerm) had been trojaned to transmit XOR garbled account information
          (hostname/username/password) over pseudo-DNS udp packets to a refurnished i486 Redhat v4.2 box used as a single-purpose
          cheap Samba fileserver in a small Australian ISP. 
    
          The little box was every cracker's dream, a discrete, utopian crack haven, installed by a former Linux-savvy administrator, the last
          of it's kind in a homogeneous Unix-illiterate Microsoft environment. The ISP practicly ignored the box, which was running (up 270
          days straight) so reliably none of them had even bothered to log in since mid 1997! So as long as the crackers kept Samba
          running, they would the box completely to themselves. 
    
          How the NT box was cracked into in the first place is still a mystery. The logs weren't helpful (surprise! surprise!) and the only way
          we were even able to confirm this had happened was by putting a sniff on the NT's traffic (following a hunch) and catching those
          sneaky packets redhanded, transmitting our SSH identification down under. 
    
          We never liked NT before, being generally suspicious of propriety blackbox OS, from a company with a long history of poor quality
          bloatware. But realizing just how helpless we were against an attacker that obviously knew the ins and outs of this can-of-worms
          OS, the company recognized that NT was a serious security hazard and changed it's security policies to keep it as far away from
          it's systems as possible, and this included restricting employees from using it from at home to log into the company network (even
          with SSH). 
    
       2.The attacker is using a custom built software penetration agent. 
    
          This is only an hypothesis, but is strongly supported by the fact that the entire attack only lasted an incredible 8 seconds! During
          which the attacker manages to log on (over an employee's SSH account, no less), gain root privileges, backdoor the system,
          remove any (standard) traces of it's activity and log off. 
    
          And they probably would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for those meddling kids! 
    
          Who thoughtfully installed a crude old tty surveillance-camera hack that trapped IO calls to and from isatty(3) file descriptors, in
          realtime, saving them on file along with a timestamp for neato it's-almost-as-if-you-were-there playback qualities. 
    
          And Wow! If there ever was a crack to appreciate for it's elegance, simplicity, and efficiency, this was it. 
    
          First off this thing is smoking fast! Which puts the likelihood of any manual intervention at square zero. It's also mean and lean.
          Forget fumbling with an FTP client, leave that to the slow soft pink-bellied human cracker-weenies, real agents pump files directly
          through the shell (uuencode(1)'d at one end, uudecode(1)'d at the other). Extending privileges with an army of amateurish
          recipe-book Bugtraq exploits? I think not! Introducing the super-exploit, an all-in-one security penetration wonder which quickly
          identifies and exploits any local security vulnerabilities for that wholesome, crispy, UID zero flavor (we were vulnerable to a recent
          KDE buffer overflow). After promptly confirming it's shiny new root privileges, the agent transfers it's last archive (a cross between a
          self-installing feature-rich backdoor, and a clean-up-the-mess, we-were-never-here log doctor), executes it and logs off. 
    
          After watching the attack on playback (at 1/8 of it's original speed) several times over, standard security-compromise ritual kicked
          in. We took the affected machine offline, remounted the disks read-only, fired up our trusty filesystem debugger, and slaved away
          to salvage whatever we could. Luckily, we found the attacker's transfered archives still intact, along with large fragments of the
          undoctored logs, allowing us to fill any still-missing details on the blitz attack. At the end of the day, when we finished playing with
          the cracked machine on loopback, we changed the compromised account's password, restored binary integrity, rebooted the
          system and put it back on the network, this time running a network dump of all it's incoming-outgoing traffic, just to be on the safe
          side. 
    
     Whoever they were, they certainly knew what they were doing, and for the most part seemed very good at it. But being determined,
     clever, and sophisticated just doesn't cut it when you do battle with wizardly foes (that's us) yielding the great powers of the Universe to
     their command: Dumb luck and clinical paranoia. 
    
     So who done it ??? 
    
     Could it be ... 
    
     (A government conspiracy I tell ya'!) 
    
     Any one of the many press-savvy three letter agencies scrambling for a bigger slice of the US-government funding pie? They've got
     motive, but are they really sneaky, clue-full and competent enough to take the blame? 
    
     How about the SIGINT spooks? The NSA (Information superiority for Americans!), or the GHCQ (Her Royal Majesty's Intelligence)?
     Someone working for the Chinese? The KGB? The Russian mob? The giant from Redmond? Elvis and Bigfoot?! 
    
     Who knows ... 
    
     They tried something spooky 2 nights later, when around 4 AM (Japanese time) our network dump captures several pseudo-DNS udp
     packets originating from a familiar Linux box in a small Australian ISP. We assume they were attempting to communicate with the software
     they left behind during their brisk first visit. Several minutes pass, and the attempt is followed by a "TCP ping" (a stealthy alternative to an
     ICMP ping), several more pseudo-DNS udp packets, and silence. 
    
     To the best of my knowledge, we haven't heard from them since. How discrete. 
    
     End of the road 
    
     That's it, it's over, on time, 10 days before the new year, 1999. 
    
     Our success. Scattered across the world, from Japan to Russia, from the Middle East to Mexico to Brazil. We were all awake when the
     scanners calmed down, within an hour of each other, on Dec 21th, 1998 08:00 GMT. 
    
     We celebrated the event at "the bunker" (see suffix item 2 for details), a discrete gathering corner where we hang out, meditate, plot,
     debate, and coordinate cr^H^Hhacking campaigns of mystical lore. Most of the attention (not to mention conversation) concentrated
     around "iap-results.txt.gz", a humble 6.4 MB compressed (1:8 ratio) textfile which embodied the sum results of our 4 month long effort. In
     no time, people downloaded local copies of the post, and were reading, grepping, parsing, cross referencing and analyzing this, that and
     other. 
    
     It was unbelievable non-stop fun the likes we had never before and never since enjoyed at the bunker. 
    
     A very memorable un"real" moment. It's funny how close the Net can bring a group of people who have never "really" met, who've never
     "really" seen each other face to face. And it doesn't seem to "really" matter, it's just as "real", as "real" as anything else gets. "real" is
     really overrated these days anyway, I mean, really. 
    
     "He's suffering from some sort of reality complex,.. obviously." 
    
     Friendship, cooperation, common interests, goals and ideals. They're the same here, in this funny netherworld, "cyberspace", as
     anywhere else. Across the barriers of culture, language and geography. The universality of human kinship, the couple, the pact, the
     tribe, the organization, the community, gracefully extended into the online domain. It's all about having a medium, connecting people,
     communicating. 
    
     Together we are better.

     Conclusions 
    
     A global fury of half a billion packets, digital signals zipping back and force across the planet at the speed of light. Above the Earth,
     across the land, under the sea, over satellite microwave, copper wiring, fiberoptics, wireless and undersea cable. Probing cyberspace. 
    
     Pretty cool, the kind of power information technology puts in our hands these days. 
    
     Seven hundred thousand vulnerabilities, gaping holes, wounds in the skin of our present and future information infrastructures, our
     dream for a free nexus of knowledge, a prosperous digital economy, where we learn, work, play and live our lives. 
    
     Easy pickings, at the fingerprints of anyone who follows in our footsteps, friend or foe. 
    
     These open points of penetration immediately threaten the security of their affiliated networks, putting many millions of systems in
     commercial, academic, government and military organizations at a high compromise risk. 
    
     Ironicly, the sheer mass of vulnerable hosts on the Internet offers it's members a primitive form of protection, that is, in a
     you-can-eat-the-other-guy school of fish sort of way. 
    
     Unfortunately, this doesn't work when you're flashing bright colors and look tasty. If you show up when a shark greps your school for
     "bank", you're in really bad shape. As this is *not* an example. 
    
     We were stunned to find just how many networks you would expect to be ultra secure were wide open to attack. Banks, billion dollar
     commerce sites, computer security companies, even nuclear weapon research centers, goddamit! 
    
     You'd think people would have some good sense and _at least_ patch their systems when an advisory comes out. 
    
      "Computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable. Any system which depends on human reliability is unreliable." - Gilb 
    
     Looking at the big picture, the problem gets worse. A catastrophe in the works. So far, we've been pretty lucky. 
    
     Consider the power these unsecure networks represent _together_. Penetrating and controlling millions of hosts? You couldn't do it
     manually, but with the right software, you could automate most of the dirty work. You'd need a careful network worm (suffix item 4),
     stealthy remote administration software (suffix item 5) and a self organizing network nervous system by which you could propagate
     control. 
    
     Imagine the implications if this sort of capability ever fell into the wrong hands. A government (China perhaps), a political terrorist group
     or organized crime. On bandwidth alone they could shut down any part (or all) of the Internet in mammoth DoS attacks. A country, a
     portal, a news site, or maybe just InterNIC. Leverage and attention, for fun and profit. They could "build" the world's largest distributed
     supercomputer, or construct an Intelligence network rivalled only by the NSA's Echelon. 
    
     Of course, who says only one group can play the game? Struggles for power in the digital domain could very well develop into the world's
     first real information war, with the very future of the Internet as a free unregulated supernetwork caught in the cross fire. 
    
     Unlikely? Far fetched? We hope so. 
    
     Still, with all the hype Y2K is getting, it seems ludicrous that the most serious _real_ threat to information technology is consistently
     ignored. 
    
     The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. Wake up fellow countrymen. Let's get to work. 
    
      Everywhere you go you'll see them searching,
      Everywhere you turn you'll feel the pain,
      Everyone is looking for the answer,
      Well look again.

     [item 2] "the bunker" - a technical reference guide 
    
     "The bunker" was hacked together by a friend who noticed how badly the group needed a realtime, secure communication forum. Our
     configuration combines an unmodified IRC server, SSH, a firewall and a Linux box (or two). There are two possible implementations, one
     more secure then the other but also (slightly) more expensive (you'll need another cheap i[345]86 box). 
    
     We'll start with our (secure) configuration. We take a cheap Linux box (i486, 8mb RAM, 500mb diskspace, two $15 Ethernet cards), with
     the bare minimum Debian installation, remove any "privilege relays" (network services, daemons (crond), suid files) and configure the
     kernel _with_ firewall support and _without_ IP forwarding. We then installed the SSH suite, and double check to make sure the *only*
     available network service is sshd's port 22 (ICMP / UDP included). As an additional layer of security, we enforce our SSH only policy at
     the OS level, by setting up the kernel's IP firewall to reject *all* incoming and outgoing _Internet_ packet traffic by default, except what we
     explicitly need to maintain *incoming* SSH sessions. 
    
     incoming rules: 
    
          default policy: deny 
          accept TCP packets from any source to thebunker.com port SSH(22) 
    
     outgoing rules: 
    
          default policy: deny 
          accept TCP packets from thebunker.com port SSH(22) to any destination 
    
     An example implementation (Our ipfwadm(8) bootup configuration): 
    
     #!/etc/ipfw/ipfw-setup
    
     # * eth0 interfaces the Internet, and eth1 interfaces the private IRC
     #   server.
     #
     # * On 2.2.X kernels and higher the IP firewalling code has been replaced,
     #   so ipfwadm (and this configuration) will no longer work. ipchains(8)
     #   should be used instead.
    
     # * Since we are not forwarding between interfaces, 0.0.0.0/0 can be used
     #   as a safe (portable) alternative to our IP address. Those of you
     #   who would rather be specific should put their IP here with a mask of 32.
     #   (For example: 208.212.172.33/32)
    
     ipfwadm -I -f
     ipfwadm -I -p deny
     ipfwadm -I -a accept -W eth1
     ipfwadm -I -a accept -W eth0 -P tcp -D 0.0.0.0/0 22
    
     ipfwadm -O -f
     ipfwadm -O -p deny
     ipfwadm -O -a accept -W eth1
     ipfwadm -O -a accept -W eth0 -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 22
    
     ---[ EOF ]---
    
     A simple, airtight firewall. One interface faces the Internet, and the other jacks straight into the safehouse (our IRC server), which should
     *not* be capable of accessing the Internet directly and vice versa. The safehouse is a similarly configured bare metal, secure Linux
     configuration running _only_ Ircd (_not_ as root!) and sshd. General purpose use of the safehouse is strongly discouraged. 
    
     User accounts on the firewall are opened for authorized members of the group, but despite trusting the system's users, access to
     administrative account must be strictly limited. This is to insulate the system from the possible security problems of its users, with the
     added benefit of protecting a user from coercion (they couldn't compromise security if their life depended on it). 
    
     The second configuration may be less secure, depending on your risk model, but is also less expensive. You would only need one Linux
     box, and one Ethernet card. We eliminate the "safehouse" and trust the firewall to run the Ircd server safely on loopback (_not_ as root!),
     while isolating it from the Internet. In this case, the security of the system _depends_ on correctly enforcing the strict IP firewall filters, and
     these are not merely an additional layer of security. Because we are running a service on loopback, the IP firewall must be set up to allow
     packets to and from the server on the local interface. While this setup is theoreticly secure "enough", it leaves a larger margin for error
     and malice. 
    
     In a nostalgic tribute to the old BBS days, "the bunker" features a black and white (green), menu driven default login shell (based on
     pdmenu), which greets users with the message of the day, announces events, and offers a consistent customizable UI to local mail,
     project forums, IRC (directly into the official, often the only system channel), and an ever growing list of other system activities. ("just one
     more feature"!) 
    
     The interface started out as a joke, and while it sounds out of date, with the current explosion of graphics, sound and video on the WWW,
     it's oddly cozy, and most of us have warmed around to it. (besides, when real work needs to get done, reaching emacs (or a shell) is just
     a key-press away)

     One of our first research projects (circa 1997) involved researching possible designs of a modern network worm. We even developed a
     prototype in C which implements some of our ideas. 
    
     Today, we're pretty horrified by our choice of language (In C, everything is equally difficult, "help save the world!" -- use Perl) and the
     quality of the code (butt ugly).

      "Local security subversion. Why human and (current) software (tripwire and others) host-based Intrusion Detection Systems are a bad
      idea." 
    
     We did some research (right after the IAP was over) in this subject, and plan to release an article sometime in the near future. 
    
     A fully-featured backdoor implementation is available, demonstrating the concept, which combines SSH ESP (suffix item 6), a kernel
     module, direct memory manipulation, and a good old fashioned binary trojan. 
    
     [item 6] SSH ESP 
    
     A hacked SSH suite modified to implement ESP (Encapsulated encrypted STREAMS Protocol) at the application level. 
    
     Notable features include: 
    
          piercing almost any current filter firewall. (ab-uses any available packet traffic: tcp, udp and icmp) 
          invisible at the operating system level. (netstat and friends will not register any activity) 
          practical. (ESP is almost as fast and reliable as TCP, including error correction) 
          military strength encryption. (thanks to SSH) 
    
     [iem 7] Note to the reader 
    
     Christ, it took me, Liraz, over 2 weeks to write this silly article, during which I had to drop whatever I was doing, and devote the bulk of my
     time to writing this memorandum of the IAP in English, which is not my native language. 
    
     (Disclaimer: Please excuse any errors in syntax, grammar or spelling. That felt good. Please forgive my bad writing, untasteful dramatics,
     poor sense of humor... I'll stop now...) 
    
     In the process I had to convince my fellow project associates (some of them very strong willed) that documenting the IAP was A Good
     Thing, at least for posterity's sake... 
    
     And all so I could offer you, dear reader, a chance to share some of my humble insights on computer security, and a taste of hacker
     culture. This is my first publication, I'm not too sure on how this is going to be accepted. Frankly, I prefer writing code, so I'm not sure I'll
     be writing any more articles soon. Whether or not that happens depends on the response I get from interested readers. 
    
     If there is a good response, there will be more. But goddammit, they'll be shorter this time! 
    
     I hope the article wasn't too technical for your tastes, but the project was mostly about overcoming technical and logistical difficulties, so
     that was hard to escape. 
    
     Also, I am very short on time and resources, so if anyone is interested in sponsoring the material (an official SSR website for the rant and
     the software), that would be great. 
    
     Oh, any takers on the IDDN front? We can start out with a (preferably archived) mailing list, find some interested people, get the ball
     rolling...

      A 15-year old has pleaded guilty to defacing the web
      page of two Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS)
      web sites. The defacement occurred back in June. The
      infocrimminal will be sentenced soon for four counts of
      unauthorized entry and the disclosure of passwords.
      The individual made several guess at the login/password
      and eventually hit upon a combination that worked,
      "news/news". (And no sanctions against TCS for having

     The LinuxPPC crack-the-box contest has come to an early end, no-one has made a
     successful attempt yet, but some the organization of the contest decided to stop it
     for the following reasons: "Although it is interesting to have all of you try to break into
     the machine here, there are some problems that we found with that method. 1) Waste
     of bandwidth, 2) Waste of usefull machine that is supposed to go to AbiSource, 3)
     People are not following the rules anymore: Instead of breaking into our machine,
     they have started to piss of the ISP and other customers because they are trying to
     break into other machines. Please note,: This is an illegal activity and out of our
     hands. If you are doing this and continue to, the normal process of prosecuting such
     action will occur. 4) Because so many people are trying, interesting attacks are
     difficult to perform."

     The person reporting the hack to the Attrition staff received it after 5 searches. We

     strong encryption to create secure data tunnels between any two points on the
     internet. It uses the IPsec protocol, an interoperable global standard for securing IP
     connections. The software generated strong interest among the 1,800 hackers who

     The US federal government is facing a tremendous shortage of people needed to fight
     future cyberwars. Over the next seven years, the government will have to replace
     more than 32,000 information technology workers -- almost half of the 71,000 IT
     workers employed by federal agencies, according to a recent study by the federal
     Chief Information Officers Council. Of most concern is the need for IT employees with
     information security skills, according to a recent federal report urging the creation of a
     massive intrusion-detection system to protect federal and critical private systems,
     such as energy, telecommunications and transportation, against cyberattack.

     needed to fight any future cyberwar. 

     Over the next seven years, the government will have to
     replace more than 32,000 information technology workers --
     almost half of the 71,000 IT workers employed by federal
     agencies, according to a recent study by the federal Chief
     Information Officers Council. Much of the turnover is the
     result of rise in the number of employees eligible for
     retirement. 

     Of most concern is the need for IT employees with
     information security skills, according to a recent federal
     report urging the creation of a massive intrusion-detection
     system to protect federal and critical private systems, such
     as energy, telecommunications and transportation, against
     cyberattack. 

     The national cyber protection plan recommends funding
     information security programs at universities and offering
     scholarships to students in exchange for a commitment to
     work at federal agencies. Such programs may ultimately
     benefit private companies. 

     Only a handful of universities now offer programs in
     information security. "Security hasn't made it into the
     mainstream of academe," said Lance J. Hoffman, a
     professor of computer science at George Washington
     University in Washington. 

     So most IT students study to become programmers or
     Windows NT experts, while security specialist tend to get
     their training on the job, said Paul Jansen, manager of
     information security at loan guarantor and administration
     company USA Group Inc. in Indianapolis. When he hires,
     "I'm hiring other companies' security people," he said. 

     If more universities offer security training, "I'm going to get
     people who have a better understanding of what our
     profession is all about," Jansen said. 

     Throughout the industry, companies are having a tough time
     hiring IT workers with security skills. "I consider the need
     dire," said Richard Power, editorial director at the Computer
     Security Institute in San Francisco. 

     Salary issues, in particular, make it hard for federal
     agencies to compete with the private sector. Government IT
     workers often start at salaries of less than $25,000, and the
     federal security plan recommends improving pay. 

     There is "fierce competition" for IT workers with security
     skills, said Timothy Grance, manager of systems and
     network security at the National Institute of Standards and
     Technology. But a pay-for-performance salary program and
     the promise of working on research projects have been
     hiring incentives, he said.

     A passage of the Copyright Amendment (Computer Programs) Bill 1999, a legislation
     passed yesterday, will allow software engineers to decompile computer software in
     limited circumstances to develop interoperable products. Read more below.

                                                                                     Attorney-General


     JOINT NEWS RELEASE 

     13 August 1999 

     Consumers will have greater choice in computer software and Australian-developed software will be more internationally
     competitive as a result of new legislation passed yesterday. 

     The Attorney-General, the Hon Daryl Williams AM QC MP and Senator the Hon Richard Alston, Minister for Communications,
     Information Technology and the Arts announced today that passage of the Copyright Amendment (Computer Programs) Bill 1999
     will allow software engineers to decompile computer software in limited circumstances so they can develop interoperable
     products. 

     Currently software copyright owners can block this type of decompilation as an infringement of copyright. 

     New laws mean developers will be able to decompile software to find this vital interface information if it is not readily available. 

     Overseas developers have been able to do this for some time, particularly in Europe and the United States of America where
     Australia's main competitors in this sector are located. 

     The amendments to the Copyright Act confirm that the Australian Government is committed to creating an environment that is
     conducive to increasing the competitiveness of Australian business and providing choice for consumers. 

     The legislation also recognises that Australia's information industries underpin competitiveness of other industry sectors,
     particularly in the global economy. 

     The legislation also makes changes to the Copyright Act important for the development of the information economy in Australia. 

     The information age brings with it new threats to our safety and security - such as computer viruses and increasing incidence of
     unauthorised access to valuable information stored digitally. 

     The legislation will help companies protect their valuable digital assets by providing another tool with which to deal with these
     threats. 

     In recognition of the importance of resolving the year 2000 computer date (Y2K) problem, the legislation will operate
     retrospectively for error correction to the date of the announcement of the Government's decision, 23 February 1999. 

     Decompilation of a program will be allowed without the copyright owner's permission for interoperability or security testing only if
     the information on the program's interfaces or on ensuring system security is not readily available. 

     Information derived from decompilation of a program about its interfaces with other software or about errors in a defective copy,
     including Y2K problems, or which is required for testing system security cannot be used or communicated to others for any other
     purpose, without the copyright owner's permission. 

     The severe penalties for copyright piracy will continue to apply. These penalties comprise up to $60,500 and / or five years in
     prison for each offence by an individual and up to $302,500 for each offence by a corporation.

     In a bid to bolster e-commerce security, the Irish government has introduced
     legislation that would criminalize the fraudulent use of e-signatures, subjecting
     violators to possible imprisonment and fines in excess of US$100,000. Under the

     Ireland Intends To Criminalize E-Signature Fraud 

     By: David McGuire
     Date: 08/13/99
     Location: WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 

     In a bid to bolster e-commerce security, the Irish government has introduced legislation that would criminalize
     the fraudulent use of e-signatures, subjecting violators to possible imprisonment and fines in excess of
     US$100,000. 

     "The (European Union) is expected to come out with an e-signature directive and we've beat them (to it) with
     our own," Ken Thompson, spokesperson for the Irish embassy in Washington, DC, told Newsbytes today. 

     Under the extensive proposed legislation, "e-signature documents and contracts will be afforded the same
     legal status as their paper counterparts," Thompson said. 

     The ultimate goal of the legislation, which is expected to be passed into law before Christmas, is to heighten
     e-commerce security using the "lightest regulatory touch" possible, Thompson said. 

     The legislation was proposed by Ireland's Department of Public Enterprise and should encounter no significant
     obstacles in becoming law, Thompson said. 

     Under Irish parliamentary structure, bills that enjoy the support of the majority party are essentially assured of
     passage. 

     Full text of the proposed legislation is located online at http://www.ecommercegov.ie/ . 

     Earlier this month, the US House of Representatives' Committee on Commerce approved by unanimous voice
     vote the Electronic Signatures in Global and National (E-SIGN) Commerce Act, H.R. 1714. 

     H.R. 1714 would legalize the use of digital signatures, making them as legally binding as a hand-signed John
     Hancock. The bill also establishes federal rules for digital signatures, replacing a patchwork of different state
     regulations.

43.0 ISRAEL AND PIRACY

     The whole of Israel shares the same disk goes the joke. But Israels almost getting
     placed on the Office of the United States Trade Representative's infamous Priority
     Foreign Country List for its alleged illegal activities is no laughing matter. According
     to the annual global report jointly prepared by the Software and Information Industries
     Association (SIIA) and the Business Software Alliance (BSA), 48 percent of software
     used in 1998 in Israel was illegal and this has to change. Wired.      
     
     Piracy Rampant in Israel
     by By Tania Hershman 
     
     3:00 a.m.  13.Aug.99.PDT
     JERUSELEM -- When is a Microsoft Intellimouse not a Microsoft Intellimouse? When it's one of the several thousands of fake mice recently seized by
     police from an Israeli warehouse. 
     
     The whole of Israel -- government included -- is sharing one disk, goes the joke. But for manufacturers big and small, Israelis' predilection for
     piracy, of software and music as well as hardware, is no laughing matter. 
     
     Israel is dangerously close to being placed on the Office of the United States Trade Representative's infamous Priority Foreign Country List for its
     alleged illegal activities. 
     
     New Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, visiting the United States this week, announced that he will be trying to appease the powers-that-be in order to
     avoid the next step -- sanctions. 
     
     According to the annual global report jointly prepared by the Software and Information Industries Association (SIIA) and the Business Software
     Alliance (BSA), 48 percent of software used in 1998 in Israel was illegal, which represents lost revenues of US$63 million. 
     
     While Israel does not top the list -- in Russia, for example, the figure is closer to 90 percent -- the United States is particularly upset with Israel
     because the government appears to be doing nothing. 
     
     There may be a reason for this. "The government is one of the biggest of the software industry's customers, and they are using illegal software,"
     says Ami Fleischer, Israel's representative to the BSA. 
     
     "But when we say illegal software, this doesn't mean that there is a government official going down to the flea market," he added. 
     
     The situation is euphemistically called 'under-licensing' or 'overworking,' meaning the number of licenses falls below the number of copies being used.
     
     On a wider scale, the Israeli public is not averse to "borrowing" software, believing that the chances of being caught are slim to none. "Bill Gates
     can afford it, right?" laughed one offender. 
     Microsoft is not the only target: Other, smaller software houses with all their hopes riding on one product are being hit much harder. 
     
     This culture of acceptable piracy may be rooted in the bootleg Hebrew music trade. At the central bus station in Tel Aviv, illegal cassettes and CDs
     of Israel's top artists are hawked openly. 
     
     The damage done to this small local industry has been sufficient to warrant a national ad campaign featuring gagged Israeli singers. 
     
     Israeli piracy is not limited to Israel's borders. Illegal copies are making their way abroad, too. "The figure of 48 percent doesn't show the whole
     picture. That doesn't get into the export issue. Forty-eight percent is a low estimate," said Keith Kupferschmidt, the SIIA's intellectual property
     counsel in Washington. 
     
     Kupferschmidt has a word of advice for new prime minister Ehud Barak. "Whenever there is a high piracy rate there is a problem with people's
     understanding of what it is acceptable to do," he said. "If you have people in government whose job it is to crack down on piracy and the
     government devotes resources, we would see a different attitude." 
     
     New legislation is in the works to modernize a copyright law dating back to 1911. According to Sandra Azancot, legal advisor on intellectual
     property law at Israel's Ministry of Justice, "The new legislation is a much more modern law, with a lot of clarification and strengthening." 
     
     For example, the punishment for criminal offenses will now be five years instead of three. 
     
     During his US visit this week, Justice Minister Beilin is talking up this legislation, as well as the new antipiracy police unit set up a few months ago.
     He will also be pointing to the fact that only three years ago 75 percent of software in Israel was illegal, over 50% higher than today. 
     
     Yes, big organizations have smartened up their act, said the BSA's Ami Fleischer, but among small businesses with smaller pockets -- half of the
     Israeli business sector -- piracy is at the 80 percent mark. "People must understand that paying for software is part of the financial costs [of the
     company]," he stresses. 
     
     With its thousands of high-tech start-ups Israel likes to think of itself as another Silicon Valley. But this won't last long if it allows potential
     technological and business allies to be ripped off. 
     
     The Office of the US Trade Representative, which normally surveys the situation every April, is holding an extraordinary review in December of the
     Israeli government's progress. If it is not impressed, Israel will have six months to comply with certain conditions, says Fleischer, "and then the
     federal government will be obliged to impose sanctions."

     Adi Shamir, one of the developers of the RSA encryption method, says he has
     designed a computer that could crack open a file encoded using RSA in only a few
     days. Needless to say, with RSA being one of the most widespread used encryption
     methods, such a computer could jeopardize the privacy of the bulk of electronic
     commerce as practiced today. Full story.          
     
     Code-cracking computer causes concern
  
     WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- A developer of one of the most widespread
     computer encryption systems said Thursday he has designed a computer
     that could crack open a file encoded using the most common form of data
     encryption in only a few days. 
  
     If built -- at an estimated cost of about $2 million -- such a computer could
     jeopardize the privacy of the bulk of electronic commerce as practiced
     today, according to cryptographers at the conference where the design was
     shown. 
  
     Most highly sensitive military, banking and other data are protected by
     stronger encryption keys beyond its reach. The commonly used weaker
     keys, though, would become ''easy to break for large organizations,'' said
     cryptographer Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot,
     Israel. 
  
     He developed both the new computer design and helped invent the
     widespread coding system -- known as RSA public-key encryption -- that it
     cracks. 
  
     Shamir spoke at the opening of a two-day conference of more than 120
     cryptography experts from around the world at Worcester Polytechnic
     Institute. 
  
     Computer scientists said his work underscores the growing vulnerability of
     the most commonly used short form of RSA keys, which consists of just 512
     bits. The key -- a sequence of 1s and 0s, or bits -- unlocks the secret coding
     of a computer transmission so it can be deciphered. 
  
     Shamir dubs his idea for the computer Twinkle, which stands for The
     Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine, and also refers to the twinkle of
     its light-emitting diodes. The 6-by-6-inch optical computer would measure
     the light from diodes to perform mathematical calculations solving 512-bit
     RSA encryption keys faster than ever -- within two or three days. An effort
     in February to solve shorter, easier 465-bit keys took hundreds of computers
     and several months. 
  
     Shamir first informally showed a prototype of his device at a conference in
     Prague, the Czech Republic, in May. He publicly outlined its workings at
     length for the first time Thursday. 
  
     ''Twinkle is a little out there, but it looks like it's buildable to me,'' said Seth
     Goldstein, an expert in computer architecture at Pittsburgh's Carnegie
     Mellon University. 
  
     Organized crime, friendly and unfriendly governments, research institutions
     and others might take an interest in such a project, conference participants
     suggested. 
  
     In any event, users of 512-bit keys ''should be worried,'' said Christof Paar,
     a computer engineer at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
  
     ''In the current state of the art, it is not secure,'' added Bob Silverman, a
     research scientist at Bedford, Mass.-based RSA Laboratories, a division of
     RSA Data Security, which Shamir co-founded but where he no longer
     works. 
  
     Longer keys, such as 1,024-bit, are already employed for many sensitive
     communications. But, out of intelligence and other concerns, the U.S.
     government requires special permission to export software with the longer
     keys. The most popular browsers are normally set to just 512 bits. 
  
     Brian Snow, a technical director for information security at the National
     Security Agency, spoke to the conference Thursday about weak quality
     assurance in commercial security products, but declined to answer press
     questions. 
  
     Longer keys are harder to set up and take more computer power to operate.
     Such power may be scarce in the wireless telephones, home appliances and
     other computerized conveniences of the future, cryptographers said.

       Hacking your way to an IT career
                        By Ann Harrison


     ALTLANDSBERG, GERMANY -- At the first annual Chaos
     Communication Camp, which took place outside of Berlin
     last weekend (see story), hundreds of hackers and their
     machines filled the main hack tent exchanging information
     on the latest exploits and security tools. Most were young,
     skillful and in demand by corporate information technology
     departments. 

     The camp, which attracted some of the most talented
     European and American hackers, was one of the largest
     hacker gatherings in Europe so far this year. 

     David Del Torto, director of technology for security services
     at Deloitte & Touche in San Francisco, agreed. He noted
     that hackers like himself were working at all the top five
     auditing and accounting firms. 

     Del Torto presented hacker career workshops with titles
     such as "Take This Job and Ping It/Hacking The Corporate
     Ladder For Fun & Profit." 

     The following are some of the tips he offered hackers
     seeking corporate jobs: 

       -  Write your own job description. 

       -  Volunteer for a project in your area of expertise. 

       -  Network with people. 

       -  Start your own company. 

       -  Or sign on to another start-up.

     He also advised the crowd to build tools they themselves
     would use ("You should be customer No. 1!"), license
     technology when appropriate and solve problems with free
     software or generate it. 

     "When building reputation capital, it's pretty important to
     learn to think like the boss,'' he said. 

     In addition to his day job, Del Torto is a member of the
     Cypherpunks, a San Francisco-based hacking organization
     that produces what he calls "no-compromise" security
     technology. 

     Del Torto had advice for his Fortune 1000 brethren, too.
     Asked if young hackers, who may not be partial to suits and
     ties, are discriminated against, Del Torto recalled that Dan
     Farmer, author of the widely used Satan network scanning
     tool, was once turned down by a prospective employer who
     found his appearance unsettling. He urged IT managers to
     avoid superficial judgments and focus on the reputation of
     the individual. IT managers interviewing young people who
     "act differently" should remember when they were young, he
     advised. 

     Del Torto noted that in the relatively small community of IT
     security professionals, people are preceded by their
     reputations. He said he knows programmers who are
     talented, but he won't hire or recommend them because
     they don't act responsibly.

51.0 BALTIMORE TECHNOLOGIES TO SHIP ENCRYPTION TOOL FOR XML

     Baltimore Technologies expects to ship an encryption and digital signature tool kit

     Baltimore Technologies later this fall expects to ship an encryption and digital signature tool kit that will let users secure documents based on XML. 
   
     The X/Secure tool kit will let customers encrypt XML documents or use digital signatures to authenticate the identity of the author of the XML content and the
     intended recipient. Digital signatures let customers check the content of a document to ensure it was not tampered with en route to the designated recipient. 
   
     The X/Secure tool kit will be sold to meet two specific development needs, according to Sean Coughlin, Baltimore product manager. 
   
     The first use would be as a Java-based utility to run on any Java Virtual Machine in order to automatically encrypt or sign XML-based documents and verify
     signed XML documents. Second, the tool kit would let customers add digital signing and encryption capabilities to XML-based applications. 
   
     "We're basing the X/Secure tool kit on the IETF draft specification 'Digital Signatures for XML,' " Coughlin said. The World Wide Web Consortium is also
     considering this draft specification for inclusion in the suite of XML standards it shepherds, he added. Information about the specification is posted on both
     groups' Web sites. 
   
     Baltimore has not yet set a price for the X/Secure tool kit, which may be sold in two versions when it ships by the end of the third quarter. 
   
     Baltimore Technologies Inc., with headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, is at www.baltimoretechnologies.com.

     Starium Inc plans to be selling telephone scrambling devices so powerful that even
     the US government's most muscular supercomputers can't eavesdrop on wiretapped
     conversations. Needless to say, the US government isn't too thrilled about the idea.

     Starium Promises Phone Privacy
     by Declan McCullagh 
     
     3:00 a.m.  12.Aug.99.PDT
     MONTEREY, California -- The sleepy coastal town of Monterey, California, is not the kind of place where vision-fired entrepreneurs come to change
     the world. Monterey Bay is better known for sea lions than silicon, and for Cannery Row -- made famous half a century ago in John Steinbeck's
     gritty, eponymous novel. 
     
     Today, the third floor of a converted sardine factory on Cannery Row is home to a startup company developing what could become a new world
     standard in privacy protection. By early 2000, Starium Inc. plans to begin selling sub-US$100 telephone scrambling devices so powerful that even
     the US government's most muscular supercomputers can't eavesdrop on wiretapped conversations. 
     
     
     Such heavily armored privacy is currently available only to government and corporate customers who pony up about $3,000 for STU-III secure
     phones created by the US National Security Agency. By squeezing the same kind of ultra-strong encryption into a sleek brushed-steel case about
     twice the size of a Palm V -- and crafted by the same San Francisco designer -- Starium hopes to bring crypto to the masses. 
     
     "Americans by nature don't like people reading over their shoulders," says Lee Caplin, president and CEO of Starium. 
     
     True enough. But whether Americans will pay extra for privacy is open to question, especially since both people in a conversation need the Starium
     "handsets" to chat securely. 
     
     And there's another big obstacle: The US government has repeatedly tried to keep similar products off the market unless they have a backdoor for
     surveillance. Its export rules prevent Starium from freely shipping its products overseas. 
     
     Starium's three co-founders -- the company has since grown to eight people -- claim they're not fazed. 
     
     "The technology is out there. Whether they like it or not, it exists," says Bernie Sardinha, Starium chief operations officer. "You cannot stop
     progress. You cannot stop technology." 
     
     Starium at first planned to call its product CallGuard, but abandoned the name after discovering another company owned the trademark. The firm is
     considering VoiceSafe as another potential name. 
     
     Customers will use the device by plugging it into their telephone handset -- a feature allowing it to work with office systems -- and plugging the
     handset into the base of the phone. 
     
     At the touch of a "secure" button, the modems inside the two Starium units will form a link that, theoretically, creates an untappable
     communications channel. The units digitize, compress, filter, and encrypt voice communications -- and reverse the process on the other end. 
     
     The Starium handset uses a 2,048-bit Diffie-Hellman algorithm for the initial setup, and a 168-bit triple DES algorithm for voice encoding. The
     four-chip unit includes a 75 MHz MIPS processor, an infrared interface, a smart card port, and possibly serial, USB, and parallel interfaces, the
     company says. The final version will operate for over 2 hours on a pair of AA batteries. 
     
     Starium's business plan is nothing if not ambitious. In addition to selling the portable units, the company wants to add crypto capabilities to cell
     phones, faxes, and even corporate networks. Target markets include the legal, medical, banking, and even political fields. 
     
     "I've gotten a call from the George W. Bush people for use in the campaign," CEO Caplin says. 
     
     The company says it's working on deals with major cell phone manufacturers like Ericsson and Nokia to offer the same voice-scrambling in software.
     Newer cell phones have enough memory and a fast enough processor to handle the encryption. Best of all, a software upgrade could be free. 
     
     "You take your phone into a mall or a kiosk and they simply burn in the new flash ROM," Sardinha says. 
     
     The idea for Starium came from longtime cypherpunk and company co-founder Eric Blossom, who was inspired by the Clinton administration's
     now-abandoned Clipper Chip plan to devise a way to talk privately. 
     
     "I got interested around the time of Clipper. I was scratching my head saying, 'This is offensive,'" says Blossom, a former engineer at Hewlett
     Packard and Clarity Software. 
     
     Blossom created prototype devices and sold them online. But they were clunky -- about the size of a desktop modem. They were also expensive,
     and didn't sell very well. 
     
     The company's directors include Robert Kohn, former chief counsel for PGP and Borland International, and Whitfield Diffie, distinguished engineer at
     Sun Microsystems and co-inventor of public key cryptography.

53.0 OUTSMARTING THE WILY COMPUTER VIRUS

     CNN has yet another story on computer viruses. This one doesn't deal with any
     specific viruses however, but more with the precautions you can take. Mostly "make
     backups" and "update your AV-software" stuff you could think up yourself, but o what
     the hell :)      
     
     Outsmart the wily computer virus 

     August 11, 1999
     Web posted at: 3:21 p.m. EDT (1921 GMT)

     by Carla Thornton 

     (IDG) -- PROBLEM: Even if your PC runs an antivirus program, the risk of
     a data-destroying infection is real. 

     SOLUTION: Take a few additional precautions to help keep your computer
     safe and sound. 

     Shane Toven never worried about computer
     viruses. The chief engineer and IS manager
     for KAXE-FM in Grand Rapids, Minnesota,
     knew that the whole staff used antivirus
     software and practiced "safe computing."
     Then last April, Chernobyl -- one of the year's
     deadliest viruses -- slipped past the public
     radio station's security. Two of the station's
     Windows 95 machines suffered full
     meltdown. 

     "At first, all of our PCs worked fine on April
     26, the day Chernobyl was supposed to hit.
     Then a couple of t hem quickly ground to a
     halt," remembers Toven. "When I went to
     reboot, I got the dreaded 'insert system disk'
     message. According to Fdisk, there were no
     partitions and no boot sectors -- classic signs
     of Chernobyl." 

     Feeling more than a little sheepis h, Toven
     realized he hadn't updated McAfee
     VirusScan's signatures, the data files that
     identify specific viruses. (He was using an
     older version of the package that could not
     update itself automatically.) Chernobyl
     probably sneaked in "through a contamina ted
     file attached to an e-mail from someone we knew," he says. The virus
     destroyed 2 gigabytes of data, including employee records, correspondence,
     and other vital files. 

     Even if you follow the usual safeguards -- installing and updating a good antivi
     rus package, avoiding e-mail attachments from strangers, and never
     downloading files from the Internet -- your system probably isn't 100 percent
     safe from viruses. Few of us compute in isolation, never exchanging files with
     others. New viruses can claim c asualties before antivirus vendors identify
     them. Your best line of defense is to assume your PC will become infected --
     and take steps now to save your neck. 

     Smart precautions

     Experts and survivors who've tangled with the nastiest viruse s offer the
     following wisdom: 

     MAKE UPDATING SIGNATURE FILES EASY: As Toven discovered,
     the key to warding off most attacks is simply keeping your antivirus software
     updated. But remembering to check for new signature files, downloading
     them, an d distributing them to the people who need them can be a hassle.
     Fortunately, most programs now remind you when signature files need to be
     updated, and will download the update for you from the company's Web site at
     the click of a button. The best, includ ing Norton AntiVirus, PC-cillin, and
     McAfee VirusScan, perform this job automatically as often as once a day. 

     KEEP A BOOT DISK HANDY: Melissa and other Word and Excel macro
     viruses that torment most users at one time or another do little seriou s
     damage. But an infestation such as Chernobyl may stop your PC from even
     starting up. That's when you reach for the boot disk -- a floppy from which
     you can run the antivirus program's scanner if your PC becomes inoperable.
     Most antivirus packages give y ou the option of making a boot disk during
     setup. If yours does not, you can easily make your own, notes Ken Dunham,
     virus expert at About.com (formerly the Mining Company). Dunham says
     users can find instructions for creating a start-up disk, plus other virus-related
     advice, at antivirus.about.com (link below). "You should boot from a clean disk
     before removing a virus," he says. "Some viruses can't be cleaned any other
     way." 

     USE MORE THAN ONE ANTIVIRUS UTILITY: No single antivirus
     package can detect and remove every virus, so using multiple programs
     lessens the chance of a virus getting through. "Pay for one commercial
     package and add one or more free programs," suggests Dunham. "Set the
     primary package to scan all the time and use the second ary programs only
     when you need them, so they don't conflict. It's like getting a second opinion
     from a doctor." Find a list of free antivirus products at
     antivirus.about.com/library/weekly/aa051099.htm (link below). And pick up
     extra protection from a fr ee Web-based scanning service like Trend Micro's
     HouseCall or Network Associates' McAfee Clinic (links below). 

     CLEAN UP AFTER AN INVASION: Once you rid your PC of its
     marauder, don't stop there, advises Joe Wells, author of the WildList of viru
     ses. "Read up on what the virus does to files, then take steps to eliminate
     unpleasant surprises down the road," he says. "For instance, Melissa turns off
     the dialog box asking if you want to enable macros in Microsoft Word
     documents, so after disinfectin g you'll need to turn that feature back on to
     remind yourself you have that security option." (In Word 97, select Tools,
     Options, click General, and check "Macro virus protection"; in Word 2000,
     select Tools, Macros, Security and choose Medium security.) 

     Back in Grand Rapids, Shane Toven was about to reformat the hard drives on
     his devastated computers when he happened upon PowerQuest's Lost &
     Found data-recovery utility (link below). "I downloaded and installed the demo,
     and in half an hour, I had re covered all my wiped-out files," reports Toven.
     Another utility, the free MRecover (link below), can also restore
     Chernobyl-savaged computers. 

     Toven got a lucky break. Your best defense: Keep backups of all your vital
     data. After his near-fatal brush with Chernobyl, Toven changed his modus
     operandi: "I went out and bought a separate NT server just for backups," he
     reports. "I also now keep clean, write-protected boot disks for each operating
     system we use."

54.0 NEW MAIL ATTACK IDENTIFIED
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     by Thejian, Thursday 12th August 1999 on 5:00 am CET
     Information security consultant R. Rosenberger says to have developed an
     e-mail-borne attack which can potentially defeat most major network security and
     anti-virus software products. Instead of slipping in undetected this attack attacks the
     security software head-on as it tries to scan e-mail attachments. The flaw is said to
     be that most security software products are unable to handle "pathological events".
     As an example is given a recursive e-mail attachment (multiple attachments in
     attachments) which could crash security products trying to scan it and which on its
     turn could take the whole operating system with it, effectively shutting the server
     down. "I know of products where I can own the box, just by sending an e-mail that
     nobody receives. I can own the e-mail server, the gateway server -- anything that's
     part of the e-mail infrastructure," Rosenberger said. Full story.

     InternetNews.com Correspondent 
                                                                                     Business News Archives 


     An information security consultant said Wednesday he's discovered a serious flaw in network security and anti-virus software products
     -- a flaw that could threaten the Internet's e-mail infrastructure. 

     According to Robert Rosenberger, he's developed an e-mail-borne attack which can potentially defeat most major security products --
     not by slipping by undetected, but by attacking the security software head-on as it tries to scan email attachments. 

     While most security software products can successfully protect themselves against code that tries to disable them, Rosenberger claims
     they also contain programming errors which render them unable to handle what he calls "pathological events". 

     One example is a recursive e-mail attachment, or multiple attachments within attachments. According to Rosenberger, when security
     products encounter such specially crafted files at the local or server level, most will crash, and take the operating system with them. 

     "I know of products where I can own the box, just by sending an e-mail that nobody receives. I can own the e-mail server, the gateway
     server -- anything that's part of the e-mail infrastructure," Rosenberger said. 

     Besides consulting to corporations and government agencies, Rosenberger is the author of the Computer Virus Myths Web site which
     critizies anti-virus software vendors for whipping up what he calls virus hysteria in an attempt to boost sales. 

     Rosenberger recently notified Network Associates, Symantec, and several other major antivirus software vendors about his findings
     and most have promptly responded by upgrading their products to thwart the attack, which he calls the E-mail Infrastructure Security
     vulnerability. Officials of the firms were not immediately available for comment. 

     A representative of the Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) Wednesday said that organization was not aware of
     Rosenberger's findings. Officials from the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) were not immediately available for
     comment. 

     While he hasn't publically released information about his exploit, Rosenberger says others could potentially discover similar flaws. 

     "In about three weeks, every wannabe hacker on the planet is going to know about this and post some kind of sample file, and they're
     going to be a lot better than mine."

                 Microsoft IIS and all other products that use the IIS web engine have a
      vulnerability whereby a flood of specially formed HTTP request headers
      will make IIS consume all available memory on the server and then
      hang. IIS activity will be halted until the flood ceases or the service is
      stopped and restarted.
      
      Quoted from Nobuo Miwa's post to Bugtraq:

      Simple play. I sent lots of "Host:aaaaa...aa" to IIS like...

      GET / HTTP/1.1
      Host: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....(200 bytes)
      Host: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....(200 bytes)
      ...10,000 lines
      Host: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....(200 bytes)

      I sent twice above request sets. Then somehow victim IIS got memory
      leak after these requests. Of course, it can not respond any request
      any more. If you try this, you should see memory increase through
      performance monitor. You would see memory increase even after those
      requests finished already. It will stop when you got shortage of virtual
      memory. After that, you might not be able to restart web service and you
      would restart computer. I tried this against Japanese and English
      version of Windows NT.
      
      Microsoft released a patch for this vulnerability on August 11, 1999.
      However, on August 12, 1999 they retracted it due to an error that
      made IIS hang whenever the logfile was an exact multiple of 64KB.
      Microsoft is working to correct this error, and will re-release the patch
      when it is solved.

     Forbes has a story on a new crypto company setting up shop in the States, but
     which is able to evade the US restrictions on the export of sensitive crypto because
     their product designers reside in Sweden. Read more on the company and its
     products here.

     An encryption firm finds the key to success: not being born in the U.S.A. 
     
     Data lock 
     
     By Nikhil Hutheesing 
     
     E-COMMERCE will really take off only after we find better ways to keep sensitive personal and corporate data under lock and key. Keeping data secure yet accessible
     to the right people is harder than you might think. 
     
     Protegrity, a Swedish firm invading the U.S. market by setting up its headquarters in Stamford, Conn., is making this market its own. One reason it can beat out U.S.
     competitors in landing business from firms that span the globe: It can run around U.S. export restrictions on encryption software. Since it's a foreign-born business, it can
     sell abroad without running afoul of U.S. export laws. It ships software from Sweden. 
     
     Protegrity's roots go back to 1994, when Ulf Dahl, a business executive who managed a software company in Stockholm, was writing software that would let city
     governments store personal data--such as marriage certificates and medical histories--while keeping those data separate from citizens' names and inaccessible to
     snoops. He came across Anonymity Protection, a Swedish startup in Gothenburg that was creating encryption software, and joined it. 
     
     Dahl and the engineers at Anonymity devised two programs. One sits on a server and stores the company's security policy, including information on who may access
     which account files. That information is securely transmitted to all the other servers--perhaps thousands of them--that plug into a company's databases. A second
     program then encrypts the designated files on the database. 
     
     Note that this lock and key is a bit different from what you usually see in a computer network storing sensitive data. Your brokerage firm, for example, often stores your
     account data and password in unencrypted form on a server. It protects your information by encrypting the transmission of the data across phone lines. Your password
     is scrambled as it leaves your modem, thwarting an eavesdropper who might tap into the phone line. But the trading records are stored in plain text. Someone breaking
     into the broker's database server could get access to them. 
     
     In the Protegrity system, you encrypt only the specific data you want to keep hidden from snoops while leaving other data accessible to internal users or outsiders
     tapping in, perhaps, over the Internet. Data can be encrypted at 128 bits or higher (you could need more computers than the Pentagon has to crack the code). 
     
     Getting hold of data by unauthorized users is tough because a series of events, transparent to the user, have to occur. When you try to gain access to information,
     Protegrity's system checks to see if you have been included as an authorized user in the gatekeeper. If you pass that, it goes on to double-check that the database that
     keeps your data is also instructed to let you in. Then it checks a series of rules that determine the information you are allowed to see. Once you pass those steps, and the
     system sees you are allowed to see the encrypted data, it generates a decryption key that is stored by the gatekeeper in encrypted form. 
     
     In 1996 Protegrity set up shop above a restaurant overlooking a marina in Stamford. "I realized that to make a success of this product, I would have to go where the
     market was," explains Dahl. To run the show, the company hired David Morris, who had been an executive vice president at Cylink, a manufacturer of cryptographic
     products. 
     
     Although Protegrity had become naturalized, it keeps its product designers in Sweden. The company continues to enjoy its exemption from the U.S. ban on exporting
     sensitive encryption technology. 
     
     That ban was meant to prevent hostile nations and criminals from talking in ways that G-men can't understand, yet its effect has been to hand foreign firms a huge
     advantage in the market for software to encrypt and decrypt sensitive files. That software segment could be worth $9 billion in sales over the next five years, says the
     Economic Strategy Institute. At the end of 1997 there were already 653 encryption products being made in 29 countries outside of the U.S. 
     
     Unlike Protegrity, American encryption companies have to engage in some fancy footwork to stay legal. "It's like defusing mines--one wrong turn and the mine could
     explode," says Stewart Baker, a partner in the law firm Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, D.C. For instance, if only two of a firm's engineers, one in the U.S. and one
     abroad, were to exchange insights about an encryption algorithm, the U.S. government could shut the company down, fine it $1 million and jail its employees. 
     
     Tiny Protegrity has yet to turn a profit, but that could change. Oracle, IBM and Informix all promote a version of Protegrity's software that works with their databases. 
     
     Customers are also putting more of their sensitive data on-line. Lucent Technologies, which uses Informix's databases attached to a Protegrity security system, now lets
     companies that buy wireless equipment log on to its Web site to pull up their account information. Before the switchover a few months ago, customer data had been kept
     separate, and could be provided only by fax or phone. 
     
     Roche Holdings' Swedish offices used Protegrity to integrate patient information into its database. Now doctors there can key in the names of their patients, the drugs
     they take and the side effects. If Roche's database detects a dangerous trend--say, too many patients begin fainting--Roche could quickly notify all the doctors. 
     
     There is pressure on the government to loosen the U.S. export laws on encryption. But even if that happens, Protegrity and its offshore rivals will have a head start over
     any U.S. competitors.

58.0 L0PHT IRDP ADVISORY
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     From http://www.net-security.org/ 
       
     by Thejian, Thursday 12th August 1999 on 3:40 am CET
     "Companies and users of broadband modems beware: Malicious hackers may be
     "listening" in on your computer's conversation across the Internet." ZDNet picks up on
     the today released IRDP advisory by L0pht Heavy Industries, a flaw which could allow
     an unauthorized user to intercept outgoing information, possibly modify unencrypted
     or lightly encrypted data or deny service to the network. ZDNet story.

     Hackers may be snooping on you
     By Robert Lemos, ZDNN
     August 11, 1999 5:41 PM PT

     Companies and users of broadband modems beware: Malicious hackers may be "listening" in on your
     computer's conversation across the Internet.
     
     That's the danger highlighted in a security advisory released on Wednesday by hacker-cum-security
     specialists L0pht Heavy Industries. The flaw affects Windows 95, 98 and 2000 as well as the
     SunOS and Solaris 2.6 running a network service known as the ICMP router discovery protocol, or
     IRDP, that determines the route computers use to connect to the Internet.
     
     The result: An unauthorized user can intercept outgoing information, possibly modify unencrypted or
     lightly encrypted data, or deny service to the network. 
     
     A slight detour for data
     Except for the denial of service attack, the malicious programmer needs to be inside the network,
     stated the advisory. For cable modem users, however, an internal user could be anyone on the local
     loop -- a neighbor or someone on the next block. Since many cable-modem-based networks use the
     rerouting technology, users are left open to someone snooping their communications to the Internet. 
     
     In essence, another computer on the same network can be used to change the default path that
     packets take out to the Internet. By placing the address of their own server in the system, an
     attacker can look at all the outgoing packets of information. 
     
     While it's a bit of a one-sided conversation -- since incoming packets enter the network normally -- a
     great deal of information can be gleaned from the outgoing packets, possibly including passwords
     and credit cards numbers.
     
     The most worrisome part of the flaw on Microsoft Windows is that the operating system continues
     to be vulnerable even when the user believes they have closed the hole. (See the L0pht advisory.) 
     
     Some assembly required 
     In a move long considered controversial, L0pht has decided to release the source code to the basics
     of a program that could exploit such a hole.
     
     However, L0pht did delay the release of the advisory at Microsoft's request, said one L0pht
     member, known by his handle Space Rogue, in an e-mail.
     
     Microsoft and Sun Microsystems Inc. declined to offer comment while members of L0pht could not
     be contacted.

     WORCESTER, Mass. (August 13, 1999 10:29 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - Computer encryption experts say a new computer design, if built, could
     crack the secret keys that now protect the bulk of electronic commerce. 
     
     The estimated cost of such a computer - $2 million - would be manageable for many organizations. But most highly sensitive military, banking and other
     data are already protected by stronger keys, according to cryptographers at the conference where the design was shown. 
     
     The commonly used weaker keys, though, would become "easy to break for large organizations," said cryptographer Adi Shamir of the Weizmann
     Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. 
     
     He developed both the new computer design and helped invent the widespread coding system - known as RSA public-key encryption - that it attacks. 
     
     Shamir spoke Thursday at the opening of a two-day conference of more than 120 cryptography experts from around the world at Worcester Polytechnic
     Institute. 
     
     Computer scientists said his work underscores the growing vulnerability of the most commonly used short form of RSA keys, which consists of just 512
     bits. The key - a sequence of 1s and 0s, or bits - unlocks the secret coding of a computer transmission so it can be deciphered. 
     
     Shamir dubs his idea for the computer Twinkle, which stands for The Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine and also refers to the twinkle of its light
     emitting diodes. The 6-by-6-inch optical computer would measure the light from diodes to perform mathematical calculations solving 512-bit RSA
     encryption keys faster than ever - within two or three days. An effort in February to solve shorter, easier 465-bit keys took hundreds of computers and
     several months. 
     
     Shamir first informally showed a prototype of his device at a conference in Prague, the Czech Republic, in May. He publicly outlined its workings at length
     for the first time Thursday. 
     
     "Twinkle is a little out there, but it looks like it's buildable to me," said Seth Goldstein, an expert in computer architecture at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon
     University. 
     
     Organized crime, friendly and unfriendly governments, research institutions and others might take an interest in such a project, conference participants
     suggested. 
     
     In any event, users of 512-bit keys "should be worried," said Christof Paar, a computer engineer at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
     
     "In the current state of the art, it is not secure," added Bob Silverman, a research scientist at Bedford-based RSA Laboratories, a division of RSA Data
     Security. Shamir co-founded RSA Data but no longer works there. 
     
     Longer keys, such as 1,024-bit, are already employed for many sensitive communications. But, out of intelligence and other concerns, the U.S.
     government requires special permission to export software with the longer keys. The most popular browsers are normally set to just 512 bits. 
     
     Brian Snow, a technical director for information security at the National Security Agency, spoke to the conference Thursday about weak quality assurance
     in commercial security products. But he declined to answer general questions for the press. 
     
     Though available, longer keys are harder to set up and take more computer power to operate. Such power may be scarce in the wireless telephones,
     home appliances and other computerized conveniences of the future, cryptographers said.

     Hack attacks drive outsourced security
     By Jim Kerstetter and John Madden, PC Week
     August 8, 1999 9:03 PM PT
     URL: 
     
     When it comes to implementing network security, even the outsourcers are turning to outsourcing
     partners.
     
     Internet Security Systems Inc., the company that put network intrusion detection on the map, will
     announce this month that it is providing managed security services to Internet service providers such
     as AT&T Corp. and to outsourcing companies such as Electronic Data Systems Corp. ISS has
     similar partnerships in the works with British Telecommunications plc., MCI WorldCom Advanced
     Networks and Nippon Telephone & Telegraph Corp., officials said.
     
     Driving this second layer of outsourcing is the complexity of security technology, particularly
     vulnerability scanning and intrusion detection, along with a shortage of people who can manage such
     a critical part of a company's network. "We've actually been doing this ... for some time with a few
     customers," said Tom Noonan, CEO of ISS, in Atlanta. "It's finally gaining some traction."
     
     It's also likely to gain interest from harried IT administrators at places such as Cornell University's
     Graduate School of Management. Two weeks ago, hackers broke into one of the school's Sun
     Microsystems Inc. servers running a database of statistical research material. The intruder had set
     up a File Transfer Protocol site on the server, presumably to take out information.
     
     "[Intrusion detection] is almost becoming a full-time job--detecting it and then cleaning up after it,"
     said Kevin Baradet, the Ithaca, N.Y., graduate school's network services director. Baradet is looking
     to purchase intrusion detection software for the graduate school, with 24-by-7 support likely to weigh
     heavily on his mind, he said.
     
     Security outsourcing is not new. IBM Global Services, in Armonk, N.Y., has more than 450 people
     dedicated to security, including an implementation program for ISS products. Companies such as
     GTE Internetworking have been hosting security products for years.
     
     But now, many more players are jumping into the market.
     
     Compaq Computer Corp., for example, has begun a pilot project with ISS to provide intrusion
     detection. The Houston company's Security Healthcheck service will, for now, be entirely managed
     by Compaq consultants. It's in pilot testing with several customers and will be in general release by
     the end of the year, said officials at Compaq's services division in Stow, Mass.
     
     In addition, Control Data Systems Inc., of Arden Hills, Mich., last week announced security
     outsourcing services, including perimeter security, data and resource protection, management and
     monitoring, and identification and authentication.
     
     For ISS, the next step is taking those relationships further. Not only is the company selling the
     software and training to outsourcing partners, it also is providing a managed service to those
     companies to ensure they're properly addressing their customers' security needs.
     
     The outsourcing partners will set the pricing for the security services; IT managers can expect that
     upfront costs will be less than buying their own security solutions. ISS' RealSecure Network Engine,
     for example, costs $8,995, a price that doesn't include implementation or paying a trained
     administrator to monitor it around-the-clock.
     
     Over the coming year, ISS plans to improve the scalability of its vulnerability scanning and intrusion
     detection products to make them more suitable for outsourced management, Noonan said.
     
     In essence, ISS is offering itself as a manager of the burglar alarms of corporate networks, usually
     through the outsourcing partner. "There is a need for someone to be the ADT [Security Services
     Inc.] of the Internet," Noonan said. "And we might as well lay claim to that."

    If you use a dial-up connection, your computer's IP address will not stay the same, so hackers will have a hard time locating it. However, computers that use a cable
    modem or network access with a static IP address are a little bit easier to hack. 
   
    You shouldn't be too paranoid, though: Evil hackers are mostly concerned with banks, the Pentagon, and keeping Babylon 5 on the air, not what you have on your

     From Buffer Overflow on HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
     
     By: Brian Martin

     Introduction


     Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD). We all live with it, and
     we're all accustomed to it at one level or another: "Do I
     have enough insurance?"; "Did I leave the coffee pot on
     when I left for work this morning?"; "Will my proposal be
     accepted by management?" FUD is simply a facet of life;
     something with which we all must contend to the best of
     our abilities. 

     FUD is yet another method often employed by a party
     (typically a vendor in our context) to help propogate their
     product or service. In short, this is acheived by
     attempting to instill a sense of fear, uncertainty or doubt
     in the minds of consumers regarding a competitor's
     product. By instilling FUD in the minds of consumers, the
     vendor obliquely promises dire consequences if the
     intended target does not buy their goods. 

     The obvious fallacy with this approach is that a vendor's
     product or service (P&S) is not sold on it's own merit;
     rather it is sold as a "reasonable alternative". FUD's
     primary goal is to scare consumers away from using
     superior P&S in favor of inferior (yet often more
     recognized) P&S. 

     According to the New Hackers Dictionary (aka the Jargon
     file), FUD is defined as: FUD /fuhd/ n. 

     Defined by Gene Amdahl after he left IBM to found his own
     company: "FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that
     IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers
     who might be considering [Amdahl] products." The idea, of
     course, was to persuade them to go with safe IBM gear
     rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit
     coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that
     Good Things would happen to people who stuck with IBM,
     but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors'
     equipment or software. See IBM. After 1990 the term FUD
     was associated increasingly frequently with Microsoft, and
     has become generalized to refer to any kind of
     disinformation used as a competitive weapon. (1) 

     The past few years have brought a dramatic increase in
     the FUD tactic. Not only are large companies using it to
     help stifle new and upcoming competition, in addition,
     uneducated journalists are wielding it like a four year old
     with a loaded gun: unaware of the danger, or of the
     consequences. 

     The use of FUD in a marketing campaign is often subtle
     and hard to spot. Well written FUD will blend in among
     facts and be difficult to discern. Worse, this underhanded
     tactic is often problematic in trying to counter. Rather
     than fighting against incorrect facts or misguided opinions,
     you find yourself battling vague assertions, self-serving
     maxims, and half-truths. 

     Worse yet is spotting the FUD campaign in the first place.
     Because it is an effective weapon based on half-truths,
     distinguishing it from legitimate opinion may be difficult.
     For an excellent paper and well documented examples of
     this, consult the paper titled 'FUD 101'. (2) In this
     document, Mr. Green outlines several elements and
     examples of Microsoft using a FUD campaign against the
     Linux Community. 

     In today's world of articles and press releases, we can
     identify several levels of FUD. This is important as it tells
     us how to respond to the 'news'. The more FUD, the more
     skepticism that should be given to it. The less FUD, the
     better the chance it was just uneducated conclusions
     that lead to the text. 

     Twelve Elements of FUD


     To help newcomers to the world of FUD, I have come up
     with a list of twelve elements that can and are used. In
     order to make this even easier for the consumer, I have
     devised a scale to help qualify the 'FUD level' used in a
     particular piece of writing. While this delineation is by no
     means an exact science, it can help put into perspective
     the subtle technique of disinformation. 

     a) Urgency 

     1) Buy our product now to avoid headache tomorrow!
     While this may be appealing initially, this often comes at
     the sacrifice of features or performance. Yes, it may be
     easy to use, but odds are it does a third of what
     competitor's products do. 

     2) Buy our product now because tomorrow our product will
     kick ass!
     The promise of future development (also known as
     'vaporware') encourages you to purchase the product now
     in order to receive future upgrades that will be better
     than what is on the market now. Obviously, this does
     nothing but hurt you in the here and now. 

     b) Supporters 

     3) No quoted names.
     In this world of technology professionals, it is easy to find
     someone who is a) qualified, b) supportive of the product
     and c) willing to go on the record. Anytime an article
     comes out that claims a P&S is desired or supported, but
     lacks names to back those claims, should be questioned.
     Why couldn't they find at least one person to go on
     record endorsing the product? 

     4) Quoting known frauds and charlatans.
     Worse than quoting no one is to quote frauds. Rather than
     not finding someone to endorse a P&S, they had to turn
     to someone that is well known for NOT knowing
     technology. These people will often go on the record
     endorsing anything if it propogates their name or
     company, or leads to them receiving some kind of
     incentive (read: cash). 

     c) Technical

     5) Epiphany Nomenclature Significance Naught (3)
     The use of large or fancy words in place of readily
     understood technical terms. Obscuring features behind
     words that sound impressive is a common way of hiding
     the truth. This technique is often known as 'buzzword
     compliance'. 

     6) Hyping up old or standard features in place of current
     or impressive technology.
     We all use and trade email, so a company drooling over
     themselves in light of their amazing use of the SMTP (4)
     protocol means very little. 

     d) Harm

     7) Without our P&S, you'll be hacked!
     New security and crypto based companies are fond of
     using this ploy. Without their products, you are a time
     bomb waiting to go off! Come tomorrow, evil and malicious
     hackers will intrude upon your network, deface your web
     page, read your corporate secrets and pour sand in your
     gas tank! 

     8) Without our P&S, you will not get future business!
     The trend of business is moving toward our product and
     what we deem standardizations! If you and your company
     don't jump on our bandwagon, no other company will do
     business with you! As we all know, new technology and
     new standards are only adopted after long and rigorous
     testing. To move over to a new platform or protocol
     simply because some companys says so is ludicrous. 

     9) Without our P&S, you will lose time and money!
     This varies slightly from #2 in that the FUD centers around
     your company losing time and money today, not
     tomorrow. As we all know, any enterprise outfit that could
     possibly lose money in a matter of days without a specific
     product not already implemented is doomed to begin with. 

     e) Spin Doctoring (2) 

     10) Hyping opponent's weakness
     No more than a form of mudslinging, the company doesn't
     rely on its own merit to pursuade you to use their
     products. Rather, they must display their opponents
     weaknesses and use them to convince you not to use
     theirs. 

     11) Creating weaknesses for the opponent
     Sometimes an opponent has very few weaknesses. So,
     why not make some up? Clever wording and sometimes
     outright lies lead to one company creating supposed
     weaknesses in competitors P&S. 

     12) Attacking opponent's strengths
     Akin to #1, this relies on attacking the selling points of a
     competitor's P&S. Often times, you will see this used in
     conjunction with #1 to attempt to completely belittle the
     opposing P&S. 

     For fun and amusement, you can use the twelve points
     above to rate articles. If an article or press release uses
     some of the methods above, attribute it one point per
     method. In the end, you can say that a given article has
     a "FUD Factor of 4" or rated "7 on the FUD scale". Recent
     months have shown Microsoft to be repeat offenders,
     often rating between 5 and 10 on the FUD Scale. Their
     fear of the Linux operating system shows. No one should
     ever rate higher than a 10, unless the article is made up
     of nothing but FUD. 

     Response to FUD

     As with all problems, it does little good to discuss them
     without proposed solutions. With FUD, it is much more
     manageable and easy to deal with. 

     The first thing is recognizing FUD in all its forms.
     Awareness for the average person is the tricky part.
     Consider the average person that has an interest in the
     ever changing world of technology and networking. They
     go day to day without the benefit of forums that readily
     challenge these huge companies oozing FUD at every
     crevice. Unfortunately, they are a bulk of the customers
     and supporters of these P&S. Educating them is the first
     step toward an honest profession. 

     Second, is the response. Even if you do recognize a
     company peddling FUD, how do you respond? Very simple. 

     1) Mail the author of the FUD as well as their editor. When
     doing so, be polite and present facts to back your mail.
     Site reference material, URLs or anything solid to back
     your argument and counter theirs. 

     2) Once mailed, give them a chance to correct their
     mistakes. Do not assume the FUD was intentional. The
     correction can come in the form of a retraction or followup
     article. As much as I hate to say it, the media machine
     may not allow for either. At that point, you must decided
     what to do. 

     3) Openly dispute the article in a public forum. Be it a mail
     list or web board, post the relevant parts of the article
     containing the FUD and refute them with your own facts.
     This causes a bit more strife but may be the only solution.

     Fin The use of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt in marketing
     campaigns -- while certain to get the public's attention --
     is plainly wrong. Armed with the above information, it's our
     hope that the reader will now be able to spot it, refute it,
     and most importantly, not buy into it.

                Hackers and Crackers Go Mainstream 
                Wednesday - 26/Aug/1998 by Robin Miller
     Since Rootshell went online in mid-1997, I
     thought of it as a premier hacker/cracker site
     where break-in exploits (with detailed scripts) got posted for use by
     others who enjoy this game. But as of August 1998, it's a "Network
     Security Information Site." 

     I'm sure many professional network security people already read
     Rootshell at least once a week. More should. Despite its surface
     turnabout, it's still full of security bug findings, usually with detailed
     instructions on how to exploit them. Indeed, several Pentagon officials
     have blamed Rootshell for some of the kid-type hack attempts made
     against some DoD sites in late 1997 and early 1998. 

     But not everyone in our military establishment is braindead, and by the
     time the kiddies who follow Rootshell were trying the "Hack the
     Pentagon" scripts they found there, defenses had been erected -- and
     all their attempts failed. 

     Rootshell is platform-agnostic. Bug reports and security flaws listed
     here cover UNIX, Windows and NT, Mac, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and
     everything else that pops up. There's a mailing list (outbound only, low
     volume) that keeps you up to date on new info and news, and is well
     worth subscribing to if you have any interest -- from either direction -- in
     computer and network security. 

     One last note: Rootshell, even in its new incarnation, still contains this
     disclaimer, and I'd personally appreciate it if you read and follow it.

     Abstract 
     
     Although public awareness of the need for security in computing systems is growing rapidly, current efforts to provide security are unlikely to succeed. Current security
     efforts suffer from the flawed assumption that adequate security can be provided in applications with the existing security mechanisms of mainstream operating systems.
     In reality, the need for secure operating systems is growing in todayÆs computing environment due to substantial increases in connectivity and data sharing. The goal of
     this paper is to motivate a renewed interest in secure operating systems so that future security efforts may build on a solid foundation. This paper identifies several
     secure operating system features which are lacking in mainstream operating systems, argues that these features are necessary to adequately protect general
     application-space security mechanisms, and provides concrete examples of how current security solutions are critically dependent on these features.

     1 Introduction 
     
     Public awareness of the need for security in computing systems is growing as critical services are becoming increasingly dependent on interconnected computing
     systems. National infrastructure components such as the electric power, telecommunication and transportation systems can no longer function without networks of
     computers [50]. The advent of the World Wide Web has especially increased public concern for security. Security is the primary concern of businesses which want to
     use the Internet for commerce and maintaining business relationships [24]. 
     
     The increased awareness of the need for security has resulted in an increase of efforts to add security to computing environments. However, these efforts suffer from
     the flawed assumption that security can adequately be provided in application space without certain security features in the operating system. In reality, operating system
     security mechanisms play a critical role in supporting security at higher levels. This has been well understood for at least twenty five years [2][54][39], and continues to
     be reaffirmed in the literature [1][35]. Yet today, debate in the research community as to what role operating systems should play in secure systems persists [11]. The
     computer industry has not accepted the critical role of the operating system to security, as evidenced by the inadequacies of the basic protection mechanisms provided
     by current mainstream operating systems. 
     
     The necessity of operating system security to overall system security is undeniable; the underlying operating system is responsible for protecting application-space
     mechanisms against tampering, bypassing, and spoofing attacks. If it fails to meet this responsibility, system-wide vulnerabilities will result. 
     
     The need for secure operating systems is especially crucial in todayÆs computing environment. Substantial increases in connectivity and data sharing have increased the
     risk to systems such that even a careful and knowledgeable user running on a single-user system is no longer safe from the threat of malicious code. Because the
     distinction between data and code is vanishing, malicious code may be introduced, without a conscious decision on the part of a user to install executable code, whenever
     data is imported into the system. For example, malicious code could be introduced with a Java applet or by viewing apparently benign data that, in actuality, contains
     executable code [32][62]. More so than ever, secure operating systems are needed to protect against this threat. 
     
     The goal of this paper is to motivate a renewed interest in secure operating systems. By consolidating a number of well-documented examples from the literature, it
     argues that the threats posed by the modern computing environment cannot be addressed without support from secure operating systems and, as was stated in [8], that
     any security effort which ignores this fact can only result in a ôfortress built upon sand.ö Section 2 describes a set of secure operating system features which are
     typically lacking in mainstream operating systems but are crucial to information security. The need for these features is highlighted in section 3, which examines how
     application-space access control and cryptography cannot provide meaningful security without a secure operating system. Section 4 provides concrete examples of how
     security efforts rely on these operating system security features. Section 5 discusses the role of operating system security with respect to overall system security.
     
     2 The Missing Link 
     
     This section identifies some features of secure operating systems which are necessary to protect application-space security mechanisms yet are lacking in mainstream
     operating systems. They form the ômissing linkö of security. Although this section only deals with features, it is important to note that features alone are inadequate.
     Assurance evidence must be provided to demonstrate that the features meet the desired system security properties and to demonstrate that the features are
     implemented correctly. Assurance is the ultimate missing link; although approaches to providing assurance may be controversial, the importance of assurance is
     undeniable.
     
     The list of features in this section is not intended to be exhaustive; instead it is merely a small set of critical features that demonstrate the value of secure operating
     systems. A more complete discussion on secure operating systems, including discussions of assurance, can be found in [25], [59] or [20]. Subsequent sections argue the
     necessity of these features by describing how application-space security mechanisms and current security efforts employing them are vulnerable in their absence. 
     
     Mandatory security 
     
     The TCSEC [20] provides a narrow definition of mandatory security which is tightly coupled to the multi-level security policy of the Department of Defense. This has
     become the commonly understood definition for mandatory security. However, this definition is insufficient to meet the needs of either the Department of Defense or
     private industry as it ignores critical properties such as intransitivity and dynamic separation of duty [12][22]. This paper instead uses the more general notion of
     mandatory security defined in [59], in which a mandatory security policy is considered to be any security policy where the definition of the policy logic and the
     assignment of security attributes is tightly controlled by a system security policy administrator. Mandatory security can implement organization-wide security policies.
     Others have referred to this same concept as non-discretionary security in the context of role-based access control [22] and type enforcement [39][7][13].1 
     
     ___________________ 
     
          1. Actually, long ago, the term non-discretionary controls was used for multi-level security as well [39]. 
     
     Likewise, as defined in [59], this paper uses a more general notion of discretionary security in which a discretionary security policy is considered to be any security
     policy where ordinary users may be involved in the definition of the policy functions and/or the assignment of security attributes. Here discretionary security is not
     synonymous with identity based access control; IBAC, like any other security policy, may be either mandatory or discretionary[58]. 
     
     An operating systemÆs mandatory security policy may be divided into several kinds of policies, such as an access control policy, an authentication usage policy, and a
     cryptographic usage policy. A mandatory access control policy specifies how subjects may access objects under the control of the operating system. A mandatory
     authentication usage policy specifies what authentication mechanisms must be used to authenticate a principal to the system. A mandatory cryptographic usage policy
     specifies what cryptographic mechanisms must be used to protect data. Additionally, various sub-systems of the operating system may have their own mechanism usage
     policies. These subsystem-specific usage policies may be dependent on the cryptographic usage policy. For example, a network usage policy for a router might specify
     that sensitive network traffic should be protected using IPSEC ESP [4] in tunneling mode prior to being sent to an external network. The selection of a cryptographic
     algorithm for IPSEC ESP may be deferred to the cryptographic usage policy. 
     
     A secure system must provide a framework for defining the operating systemÆs mandatory security policy and translating it to a form interpretable by the underlying
     mandatory security mechanisms of the operating system. Without such a framework, there can be no real confidence that the mandatory security mechanisms will
     provide the desired security properties. An operating system which provides mandatory security may nonetheless suffer from the presence of high bandwidth covert
     channels. This is an issue whenever the mandatory security policy is concerned with confidentiality. This should not, however, be a reason to ignore mandatory security.
     Even with covert channels, an operating system with basic mandatory controls improves security by increasing the required sophistication of the adversary. Once
     systems with basic mandatory controls become mainstream, covert channel exploitation will become more common and public awareness of the need to address covert
     channels in computing systems will increase[57]. 
     
     In any system which supports mandatory security, some applications require special privileges in the mandatory policy in order to perform some security-relevant
     function. Such applications are frequently called trusted applications because they are trusted to correctly perform some security-related function and because they are
     trusted to not misuse privileges required in order to perform that function. If the mandatory security mechanisms of a secure operating system only support
     coarse-grained privileges, then the security of the overall system may devolve to the security of the trusted applications on the system. To reduce the dependency on
     trusted applications, the mandatory security mechanisms of an operating system should be designed to support the principle of least privilege. Type enforcement is an
     example of a mandatory security mechanism which may be used both to limit trusted applications to the minimal set of privileges required for their function and to
     confine the damage caused by any misuse of these privileges [48][28]. 
     
     The mandatory security mechanisms of an operating system may be used to support security-related functionality in applications by rigorously ensuring that subsystems
     are unbypassable and tamperproof. For example, type enforcement may be used to implement assured pipelines to provide these properties. An assured pipeline ensures
     that data flowing from a designated source to a designated destination must pass through a security-related subsystem and ensures the integrity of the subsystem. Many
     of the security requirements of these applications may be ensured by the underlying mandatory security mechanisms of the operating system. [48] 
     
     Operating system mandatory security mechanisms may also be used to rigorously confine an application to a unique security domain that is strongly separated from other
     domains in the system. Applications may still misbehave, but the resulting damage can now be restricted to within a single security domain. This confinement property is
     critical to controlling data flows in support of a system security policy [33]. In addition to supporting the safe execution of untrustworthy software, confinement may
     support functional requirements, such as an isolated testing environment or an insulated development environment [48]. For example both the Sidewinder firewall and the
     DTE firewall use type enforcement for confinement [6][12]. 
     
     Although one could attempt to enforce a mandatory security policy through discretionary security mechanisms, such mechanisms can not defend against careless or
     malicious users. Since discretionary security mecha-nisms place the burden for security on the individual users, carelessness by any one user at any point in time may
     lead to a violation of the mandatory policy. In con-trast, mandatory security mechanisms limit the burden to the system security policy administrator. With only
     discretionary mechanisms, a malicious user with access to sensitive data and applications may directly release sensitive information in violation of the mandatory policy.
     Although that same user may also be able to leak sensitive information in ways that do not involve the computing system, the ability to leak the information through the
     computing system may increase the bandwidth of the leak and may decrease its traceability. In contrast, with mandatory security mechanisms, he may only leak
     sensitive information through covert channels, which limits the bandwidth and increases accountability, if covert channels are audited. 
     
     Furthermore, even with users who are benign and careful, the mandatory security policy may still be subverted by flawed or malicious applications when only
     discretionary mechanisms are used to enforce it.2 The distinction between flawed and malicious software is not particularly important in this paper. In either case, an
     application may fail to apply security mechanisms required by the mandatory policy or may use security mechanisms in a way that is inconsistent with the userÆs intent.
     Mandatory security mechanisms may be used to ensure that security mechanisms are applied as required and can protect the user against inadvertent execution of
     untrustworthy applications. Although the user may have carefully defined the discretionary policy to properly implement the mandatory policy, an application may change
     the discretionary policy without the userÆs approval or knowledge. In contrast, the mandatory policy may only be changed by the system security policy administrator.

     In the case of personal computing systems, where the user may be the system security policy administrator, mandatory security mechanisms are still helpful in 
     protecting against flawed or malicious software. In the simplest case, where there is only a distinction between the userÆs ordinary role and the userÆs role as system
     security policy administrator, the mandatory security mechanisms can protect the user against unintentional execution of untrustworthy software. With a further
     sub-division of the userÆs ordinary role into various roles based on function, mandatory security mechanisms can confine the damage that may be caused by flawed or
     malicious software. 
     
     Although there are a number of commercial operating systems with support for mandatory security, none of these systems have become mainstream. These systems
     have suffered from a fixed notion of mandatory security, thereby limiting their market appeal. Furthermore, these systems typically lack adequate support for
     constraining trusted applications. In order to reach a wider market, operating systems must support a more general notion of mandatory security and must support
     flexible configuration of mandatory policies. 
     
     Mainstream commercial operating systems rarely support the principle of least privilege even in their discretionary access control architecture. Many operating systems
     only provide a distinction between a completely privileged security domain and a completely unprivileged security domain. Even in Microsoft Windows NT, the privilege
     mechanism fails to adequately protect against malicious programs because it does not limit the privileges that a program inherits from the invoking process based on the
     trustworthiness of the program [65]. 
     
     Current microkernel-based research operating systems have tended to focus on providing primitive protection mechanisms which may be used to flexibly construct a
     higher-level security architecture. Many of these systems, such as the Fluke microkernel [23] and the Exokernel [41], use kernel-managed capabilities as the underlying
     protection mechanism. However, as discussed in [59], typical capability architectures are inadequate for supporting mandatory access controls with a high degree of
     flexibility and assurance. L4 [38] provides some support for mandatory controls through its clans and chiefs mechanism and its IPC mechanism for identifying senders
     and receivers but still lacks a coherent framework for using these mechanisms to meet the requirements of a mandatory policy. Furthermore, L4 assumes that there will
     only be a small number of distinct security domains [38]. Flask [56], a variant of the Fluke microkernel, provides a mandatory security framework similar to that of
     DTOS [43], a variant of the Mach microkernel; both systems provide mechanisms for mandatory access control and a mandatory policy framework. 
     
     Trusted path 
     
     A trusted path is a mechanism by which a user may directly interact with trusted software, which can only be activated by either the user or the trusted software and
     may not be imitated by other software [20]. In the absence of a trusted path mechanism, malicious software may impersonate trusted software to the user or may
     impersonate the user to trusted software. Such malicious software could potentially obtain sensitive information, perform functions on behalf of the user in violation of
     the userÆs intent, or trick the user into believing that a function has been invoked without actually invoking it. In addition to supporting trusted software in the base
     system, the trusted path mechanism should be extensible to support the subsequent addition of trusted applications by a system security policy administrator [28]. 
     
     The concept of a trusted path can be generalized to include interactions beyond just those between trusted software and users. The TNI introduces the concept of a
     trusted channel for communication between trusted software on different network components [44]. More generally, a mechanism that guarantees a mutually
     authenticated channel, or protected path, is necessary to ensure that critical system functions are not being spoofed. Although a protected path mechanism for local
     communications could be constructed in application space without direct authentication support in the operating system, it is preferable for an operating system to provide
     its own protected path mechanism since such a mechanism will be simpler to assure [59] and is likely to be more efficient. 
     
     Most mainstream commercial operating systems are utterly lacking in their support for either a trusted path mechanism or a protected path mechanism. Microsoft
     Windows NT does provide a trusted path for a small set of functions such as login authentication and password changing but lacks support for extending the trusted path
     mechanism to other trusted applications [65]. For local communications, NT does provide servers with the identity of their clients; however, it does not provide the server
     identity to the client.
     
     3 General Examples 
     
     This section argues that without operating system support for mandatory security and trusted path, application-space mechanisms for access control and cryp-tography
     cannot be implemented securely. These arguments will then be used to reinforce the discussion in section 4, which analyzes concrete examples. 
     
     3.1 Access Control 
     
     An application-space access control mechanism may be decomposed into an enforcer component and a decider component. When a subject attempts to access an
     object protected by the mechanism, the enforcer component must invoke the decider component, supplying it with the proper input parameters for the policy decision,
     and must enforce the returned decision. A common example of the required input parameters is the security attributes of the subject and the object. The decider
     component may also consult other external sources in order to make the policy decision. For example, it may use an external policy database and system information
     such as the current time. 
     
     If a malicious agent can tamper with any of the components in the access control mechanism or with any inputs to the decision, then the malicious agent can subvert the
     access control mechanism. Even if the components and all of the inputs are collocated within a single file, the operating system security mechanisms are still relied upon
     to protect the integrity of that file. As discussed in the prior section, only mandatory security mechanisms can rigorously provide such integrity guarantees. 
     
     Even with strong integrity guarantees for the policy decision inputs, if an authorized user invokes malicious software, the malicious software could change an objectÆs
     security attributes or the policy databaseÆs rules without the userÆs knowledge or consent. The access control mechanism requires a trusted path mechanism in the
     operating system in order to ensure that arbitrary propagation of access cannot occur without explicit authorization by a user. 
     
     If a malicious agent can impersonate the decider component to the enforcer component, or if a malicious agent can impersonate any source of inputs to the decision,
     then the malicious agent can subvert the mecha-nism. If any of the components or external decision input sources are not collocated within a single application, then the
     access control mechanism requires a protected path mechanism. 
     
     If a malicious agent can bypass the enforcer component, then it may trivially subvert the access control mechanism. Mandatory security mechanisms in the operating
     system may be used to ensure that all accesses to the protected objects are mediated by the enforcer component. 
     
     3.2 Cryptography 
     
     An analysis of application-space cryptography may be decomposed into an analysis of the invocation of the cryptographic mechanism and an analysis of the
     cryptographic mechanism itself. The analysis of this section draws from the discussions in [51][15] [60][61][55][52]. 
     
     As an initial basis for discussion, suppose that the cryptographic mechanism is a hardware token that implements the necessary cryptographic functions correctly and
     that there is a secure means by which the cryptographic keys are established in the token. Even in this simplified case, where the confidentiality and integrity of
     algorithms and keys is achieved without operat-ing system support, this section will demonstrate that there are still vulnerabilities which may only be effectively
     addressed with the features of a secure operating system. 
     
     One vulnerability in this simplified case is that invocation of the token cannot be guaranteed. Any legitimate attempt to use the token might not result in a call to the
     token. The application that performs the cryptographic invocation might be bypassed or modified by malicious applications or malicious users. Malicious applications
     might impersonate the cryptographic token to the invoking application. 
     
     Mandatory security and protected path features in the operating system address this vulnerability. Mandatory security mechanisms may be used to ensure that the
     application that invokes the cryptographic token is unbypassable and tamperproof against both malicious software and malicious users. Unbypassability could also be
     achieved by using an inline cryptographic token, which is physically interposed between the sender of the data to be protected and the receiver of the protected data;
     however, this would be less flexible. A protected path mechanism may be used to ensure that malicious software cannot impersonate the cryptographic token to the
     invoking application. 
     
     Misuse of the cryptographic token is a second vulnerability in the simplified case. Misuse may involve the use of a service, algorithm, session or key by an unauthorized
     application. Without operating system support for identifying callers, a cryptographic token can do little more than require that a user activate it, after which, any service,
     algorithm, session or key authorized for that user may be used by any application on the system. In this case, the cryptographic token may be misused by applications
     operating on behalf of other users or may be misused by malicious software operating on behalf of the authorized user. Furthermore, unless the cryptographic token has
     a direct physical interface for user activation, malicious software can spoof the token to the user, obtain authentication information, and subsequently activate the
     cryptographic token without the userÆs knowledge or consent. Even with a direct physical interface to the user, it is impractical for the cryptographic token to require
     user confirmation for every cryptographic operation. 
     
     This second vulnerability may be addressed through mandatory security, trusted path and protected path features in the operating system. A trusted path mechanism
     obviates the need for a separate physical interface for activation. A protected path mechanism permits the cryptographic token to identify its callers and enforce
     fine-grained controls over the use of services, algorithms, sessions and keys. As an alternative to having the token deal with fine-grained controls over its usage,
     mandatory security mechanisms may also be used to provide such controls. For example, mandatory security mechanisms may be used to isolate the token for use only
     by applications executed by the user who activated the token. Furthermore, the mandatory security mechanisms can reduce the risk of malicious software being able to
     use the cryptographic token and may consequently limit the use of the trusted path mechanism to highly sensitive actions. 
     
     Hence, even in the simplest case, the features of a secure operating system are crucial to addressing the vulnerabilities of application-space cryptography. In the
     remainder of this section, the assumptions of the simplified case are removed, and the additional vulnerabilities are examined. 
     
     If the assumption that initial keys are securely established within the token is removed, then there is the additional vulnerability that the initial keys may be observed or
     modified by an unauthorized entity. Unless the initial keys are provided via a dedicated physical interface to the cryptographic token, the operating system must protect
     the path between the initial key source and the cryptographic token and may need to protect the initial key source itself. Mandatory security mechanisms may be used to
     rigorously protect the path and the key source. A trusted path may be required for initial keying. 
     
     If the assumption that the cryptographic mechanism is confined to a single hardware token is removed and implemented in software instead, the confidentiality and
     integrity of the cryptographic mechanismÆs code and data becomes dependent on the operating system, including both memory protection and file protection. Mandatory
     security is needed to rigorously ensure the mechanismÆs integrity and confidentiality. If any external inputs, such as input parameters to a random number generator, are
     used by the cryptographic mechanism, the input sources and the path between the input sources and the cryptographic mechanism must be protected with mandatory
     security mechanisms.
     
     4 Concrete Examples 
     
     This section further demonstrates that secure operating systems are necessary by showing that some widely accepted security solutions critically rely on the features of
     secure operating systems. In particular, this section examines mobile code security efforts, the Kerberos network authentication system, firewalls and network security
     protocols. 
     
     4.1 Mobile Code 
     
     A number of independently-developed security solutions for the World Wide Web, each with its own protection model, have been developed to protect against the
     threats from malicious mobile code. However, systems relying on these security solutions are vulnerable because of a lack of operating system support for security.
     Primarily, this section will emphasize this point by focusing on efforts to secure Java [27], but other efforts will also be used to highlight issues. 
     
     The primary threat that these solutions attempt to address is the threat of hostile mobile code gaining unauthorized access to a userÆs files and resources in order to
     compromise confidentiality or integrity. The threat is not limited to interpreted applets loaded from the network by a web browser; both [26] and [30] extend this threat
     model to include helper applications which may have been actively installed by a user. There is little distinction between mobile code and what is traditionally considered
     data. For example, consider that Postscript documents are actually programs with potential access to the local filesystem. Consequently, helper applications which
     operate on untrustworthy data, such as Postscript viewers, must either be executed in a less flexible mode of operation, or must be carefully confined by the operating
     system. 
     
     The basic Java Security Model is based on the notion of ôsandboxing.ö The system relies on the type-safety of the language in conjunction with the Java Security
     Manager to prevent unauthorized actions [27]. Efforts are currently underway to add additional security features to Java, such as capabilities, an expanded access
     control model, or additional controls over access to certain class libraries [70]. 
     
     The fundamental limitation of these approaches is that none can be guaranteed to be tamperproof or unbypassable. For example, although the Java language is claimed
     to be secure, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will accept byte code which violates the language semantics and which can lead to security violations [32]. JVM
     implementation errors have led to violations of the languageÆs semantics [19]. A significant portion of the Java system is currently in the form of native methods which
     are implemented as object code and are not subject to the JVMÆs type-safety checks. The JVM is not able to protect itself from tampering by other applications. Finally,
     the Java security model can offer no protection from the many other forms of malicious mobile code. In [30], the authors call for trusted systems to support a
     system-wide solution to address the threats presented by non-Java code. 
     
     Even if such problems with the JVM did not exist, these security solutions would still suffer from the fundamental limitation that they rely on application-space access
     control for security. They all depend on the local file system to preserve the integrity of the system code, including class files. All of the systems which store policy
     locally depend on file system access control to preserve the integrity of the policy files. Section 3.1 demonstrated the importance of secure operating system features for
     supporting application-space access control. 
     
     Another popular approach to ôsecuringö mobile code is to require digitally signed applets and limit execution to those originating from trusted sources [27]. In fact, native
     ActiveX security is based entirely on digital signatures, as it has no form of access control [24][27]. The basic flaw with this approach is that it is an all-or-nothing
     proposition; the user cannot constrain a native ActiveX control to a limited security domain. Mandatory security mechanisms in the operating system may be used for
     this purpose, by confining the browser to a distinct security domain. 
     
     Note that, although not sufficient by themselves, digital signatures will play an important part in mobile code security, even on secure operating systems. They can reduce
     the risk of malicious code entering the system, provide some measure of trust that an applet will behave properly, and provide another piece of information to use in
     making an access control decision. However, as with the general application-space cryptography described in section 3.2, the digital signature verification mechanism
     depends on secure operating system features to guarantee invocation, to protect the integrity of the mechanism, and to protect the integrity of the locally cached public
     keys. 
     
     The need for an operating system trusted path mechanism was highlighted by [67] which demonstrates the ease with which a trojan horse applet can capture credit card
     numbers, PIN numbers or passwords by perfectly emulating a window system dialog box. The proposed solution was an ad hoc user-level trusted path mechanism
     which required a user to customize his dialog box with a complicated graphical pattern. This solution is not adequate as it only increases the sophistication required in the
     trojan horse. 
     
     Other systems attempt to provide alternative security solutions to the mobile code threat. The Janus system [26] interposes on Solaris system calls to constrain untrusted
     native applications, and Safe-Tcl [49] provides a ôsafe interpreterö which attempts to limit the command set available to untrusted code. However, like the Java security
     solutions, these systems are subject to the same vulnerabilities as any other application-space access control mechanism; consequently, they require secure operating
     system support. 
     
     Beyond enabling all of the mobile code systems mentioned above to function securely, a secure system could also simplify them. Rather than implementing their security
     primitives in application space where they are vulnerable, they could utilize the system security services to provide a better overall system. A properly designed secure
     system would provide a flexible, economic foundation with one consistent security model for all of the different virtual machine efforts to use. 
     
     4.2 Kerberos 
     
     Kerberos [31][47] is a network authentication service originally developed for Project Athena at MIT. In addition to providing an authentication service, Kerberos
     supports the establishment of session keys to support network confidentiality and integrity services. Derivatives of Kerberos have been used to provide authentication
     and key establishment services for AFS [64], DCE [53], and ONC RPC [21]. Kerberos and systems that rely on Kerberos have been suggested as a means of providing
     security for the World Wide Web [18][36][37]. 
     
     Kerberos is based on symmetric cryptography with a trusted key distribution center (KDC) for each realm. The Kerberos KDC has access to the secret key of every
     principal in its realm. Consequently, a compromise of the KDC can be catastrophic. This is generally addressed by requiring that the KDC be both physically secure and
     dedicated solely to running the Kerberos authentication server [46].3 A typical environment also uses physically-secure dedicated systems for the servers using
     Kerberos. Without these environmental assumptions, the Kerberos authentication service and the Kerberized server applications would require secure operating system
     features to rigorously ensure that they are tamperproof and unbypassable. For the sake of argument, the remainder of this section will consider these environmental
     assumptions to be true and focus only on the security of the client workstations. 
     
     ___________________ 
     
          3. Variants of Kerberos have been proposed that use asymmetric cryptography either to reduce the cost incurred by a penetration of the KDC or to completely eliminate
          the need for the KDC [63] [66][42][18]. 
     
     Kerberos was designed for an environment where the client workstations and the network are assumed to be completely untrustworthy [10][45]. However, since the
     software on the client workstation mediates all interactions between its user and the Kerberized server applications, this assumption implies that the Kerberized server
     applications must view all client applications as potentially malicious software. Furthermore, a Kerberized server application has no means of establishing a trusted path
     to a user on a client workstation, since that would require trusted code on the client workstation. Thus, in a system that uses Kerberos, malicious software executed by a
     user is free to arbitrarily modify or leak a userÆs information, with no means of confinement; no distinctions between a userÆs legitimate requests and the requests of
     malicious software are possible. Given the increasing ease with which malicious software may be introduced into a system, the Kerberos environmental model seems
     untenable. As noted in [14], secure end-to-end transactions require trusted code at both end points. 
     
     As a basis of further discussion, suppose that there is a base set of trustworthy software on the client work-stations which is protected against tampering, but that the
     client workstation operating system still lacks mechanisms for mandatory security and trusted path. Furthermore, suppose that the client workstation is a single-user
     system which does not export any services to other systems. In spite of these assumptions, a user is still vulnerable to attacks by malicious software, such as mobile
     code downloaded by the user. 
     
     If the malicious software could spoof the client-side authentication program to the user, then it may be able to obtain a userÆs password. Even with one-time passwords,
     this attack would permit the malicious software to act on behalf of the user during the login session. A trusted path mechanism in the client workstationÆs operating
     system can be used to prevent such an attack. Additionally, such a trusted path mechanism in combination with support for a network protected path can be used to
     provide a trusted path between users and server applications. 
     
     If the malicious software can read the files used by the Kerberos client software to store tickets and session keys, then the malicious software may directly impersonate
     the user to the corresponding Kerberized server applications. Even if the session keys are encapsulated within a hardware cryptographic token, the malicious software
     can invoke the cryptographic token on behalf of the user, exploiting the misuse vulnerability discussed in section 3.2. Mandatory security mechanisms can be used to
     rigorously protect either the file or the cryptographic token against access by malicious software. 
     
     4.3 Network Security Protocols 
     
     The IPSEC network security protocols [5][3][4] are used to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality services at the IP layer. Typical implementations of the
     IPSEC protocols rely on application-space key management servers to perform key exchanges and supply keys for security associations. The IPSEC module in the
     network stack communicates with the local key management server via upcalls to retrieve the necessary information. 
     
     SSL [69] is another network security protocol that provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality services and a negotiation service for keys and cryptographic
     algorithms. SSL, however, is implemented entirely in application space and requires no kernel modifications. SSL has been implemented as a library that interposes on
     socket calls to incorporate the SSL protocol between the underlying transport protocol of the socket (e.g., TCP) and the application protocol (e.g., HTTP). 
     
     Since it relies on application-space cryptography, the key management server used by IPSEC is subject to the vulnerabilities described in section 3.2 and requires
     mandatory security mechanisms in the operating system for adequate protection. In turn, since the protection provided by IPSEC depends on the protection of the keys,
     mandatory security mechanisms in the operating system are also crucial to meeting the security requirements of IPSEC. Since the complete SSL implementation
     operates in application space, it is directly subject to the vulnerabilities described in section 3.2 and requires mandatory security mechanisms in the operating system for
     adequate protection. 
     
     Both IPSEC and SSL are intended to provide secure channels. However, as noted in [14], an end-to-end secure transaction requires a secure channel and secure end
     points. If an attacker can penetrate one of the end points and directly access the unprotected data, then the protection provided by IPSEC and SSL is only illusory. 
     
     4.4 Firewalls 
     
     A network firewall is a mechanism for enforcing a trust boundary between two networks. The analysis of this section is based on the discussions in [17][9][11][6].
     Commonly, firewalls are used to maintain a separation between insiders and outsiders for an organizationÆs computing resources. Internal firewalls may also be used to
     provide separation between different groups of insiders or to provide defense-in-depth against outsiders. 
     
     Modern firewall architectures typically involve the use of bastion hosts; in a screened subnet architecture, there may be an external bastion host on a perimeter network,
     which is highly exposed to outsiders, and an internal bastion host on the internal network, which is exposed to the external bastion host. The security of the bastion hosts
     is crucial to the security provided by the firewall. To reduce risk, bastion hosts are typically dedicated systems, only providing the minimal services required. Even with
     such minimal configuration, flaws in the proxy servers on the bastion host may permit penetration. However, mandatory security mechanisms in the operating systems of
     the bastion hosts may be used to confine proxy servers so that penetrations are narrowly limited. Similarly, the bastion hostÆs mandatory security mechanisms may be
     used to protect proxy servers against tampering. 
     
     Firewalls provide no protection against malicious insiders. Typically, insiders can easily leak information through the firewall. Malicious insiders can construct tunnels to
     permit outsiders to perform inbound calls through the firewall or may provide ways of bypassing a firewall entirely. Additionally, malicious insiders can exploit data
     leaked between users within the firewall. Although internal firewalls may be used to partition insiders into multiple trust classes, the granularity of protection is quite
     limited in comparison to what can be provided by a secure operating system. 
     
     The ability of malicious insiders to leak data through the firewall can be confined by mandatory security mechanisms in the operating systems of the internal hosts.
     Likewise, mandatory security mechanisms in the operating systems of the internal hosts can confine outsiders who perform inbound calls through tunnels constructed by
     a malicious insider to the security domains in which the malicious insider is allowed to operate. 
     
     In addition to the threat of malicious insiders, a firewall is at risk from the threat of malicious software executed by benign insiders. Typically, firewalls do not require
     that insiders strongly authenticate themselves to the firewall in order to access external services through the firewall [40]. Hence, if a benign insider executes malicious
     software on an internal host, the malicious software may seek to subvert the protection of the firewall in the same fashion as a malicious insider. An example of using a
     malicious Java applet to enable outsiders to penetrate a firewall is given in [40]. Even if insiders are required to strongly authenticate themselves to the firewall, a benign
     insider may still execute a trojan horse whose overt purpose requires external access; in this case, the malicious software may still subvert the protection of the firewall. 
     
     Mandatory security mechanisms in the operating systems of the internal hosts may be used to protect users against execution of malicious software or to confine such
     software when it is executed. If strong authentication is required prior to accessing external services, mandatory security mechanisms could be used to ensure that only
     trustworthy software on the internal hosts can communicate with the strong authentication mechanism on the firewall. In any case, the mandatory security mechanisms
     would limit the ability of malicious software to leak information or support inbound calls. 
     
     Firewalls are also susceptible to malicious data attacks [62]. Some example malicious data attacks relevant to firewalls are described in [68][40][16]. As with malicious
     insiders and malicious software, mandatory security mechanisms in the operating systems of the bastion hosts and the internal hosts may be used to confine malicious
     data attacks. 
     
     When inbound services are supported by a firewall, the firewall itself cannot protect the remote system against compromise. The remote systemÆs operating system
     must protect against misuse of the allowed inbound services and must protect any information acquired through the inbound service against leakage. Mandatory security
     mechanisms in the remote systemÆs operating system may be used to provide such protection. Additionally, mandatory security mechanisms in the internal hostÆs
     operating system are needed to confine any attack from a penetrated remote system. 
     
     When a benign insider wishes secure access to a remote service, the firewall itself cannot provide complete protection for the use of the remote service. The internal
     hostÆs operating system must protect against any attempts by the server to trick the client into misusing its privileges, as in the case where a browser executes a
     malicious applet provided by a server; mandatory security mechanisms in the internal hostÆs operating system may be used to confine these client applications. 
     
     5 System Security 
     
     No single technical security solution can provide total system security; a proper balance of security mechanisms must be achieved. Each security mechanism provides
     specific security functions and should be designed to only provide those functions. It should rely on other mechanisms for support and for required security services. In a
     secure system, the entire set of mechanisms complement each other so that they collectively provide a complete security package. Systems that fail to achieve this
     balance will be vulnerable. 
     
     As has been shown throughout this paper, a secure operating system is an important and necessary piece to the total system security puzzle, but it is not the only piece.
     A highly secure operating system would be insufficient without application-specific security built upon it. Certain problems are actually better addressed by security
     implemented above the operating system. One such example is an electronic commerce system that requires a digital signature on each transaction. A application-space
     cryptographic mechanism in the transaction system protected by secure operating system features might offer the best system security solution. 
     
     No single security mechanism is likely to provide complete protection. Unsolved technical problems, implementation errors and flawed environmental assumptions will
     result in residual vulnerabilities. As an example, covert channels remain a serious technical challenge for secure operating system designers. These limitations must be
     understood, and suitable measures must be taken to deploy complementary mechanisms designed to compensate for such problems. In the covert channel example,
     auditing and detection mechanisms should be utilized to minimize the chances that known channels are exploited. In turn, these should depend on secure operating
     systems to protect their critical components, such as audit logs and intrusion sensors, because they are subject to the same types of vulnerabilities as those discussed
     throughout this paper. 
     
     6 Summary 
     
     This paper has argued that the threats posed by the modern computing environment cannot be addressed without secure operating systems. The critical operating system
     security features of mandatory security and trusted path have been explained and contrasted with the inadequate protection mechanisms of mainstream operating
     systems. This paper has identified the vulnerabilities that arise in application-space mechanisms for access control and cryptography and has demonstrated how
     mandatory security and trusted path mechanisms address these vulnerabilities. To provide a clear sense of the need for these operating system features, this paper has
     analyzed concrete examples of current approaches to security and has shown that the security provided by these approaches is inadequate in the absence of such
     features. Finally, the reader was given a perspective of system security where both secure operating systems and application-space security mechanisms must
     complement each other in order to provide the correct level of protection. 
     
     By arguing that secure operating systems are indispensable to system security, the authors hope to spawn a renewed interest in operating system security. If security
     practitioners were to more openly acknowledge their security solutionÆs operating system dependencies and state these dependencies as requirements for future
     operating systems, then the increased demand for secure operating systems would lead to new research and development in the area and ultimately to commercially
     viable secure systems. In turn, the availability of secure operating systems would enable security practitioners to concentrate on security services that belong in their
     particular components rather than dooming them to try to address the total security problem with no hope of success.

                        HOW YOU KNOW YOUR A TRY HARD HACKER
                       -------------------------------------
                       

     I just wrote this to tell all you try hard hackers something.

     1) You goto other hacker pages on the web.
     2) You think loading a program that waz made by a hacker is hacking.
     3) The only thing you do is get the lastest passwd file from your isp.
     4) You goto channels like #hack and ask for passwd files.
     5) You don't know where to get warez.
     6) You always telnet to hosts and type

     login: root
     password: root

     and stuff like that.

     7) You brag about how you are a hacker.
     8) You don't know C.
     9) Your a girl.
     10) You don't know what's a shell.
     11) You don't know what Linux, FreeBSD and all those other UNIX's are.
     12) You don't have a UNIX OS.
     13) You think when using IRC war scripts, your hacking.
     14) Asking how to hack other people's computer.
     15) You try cracking a shadowed passwd file.
     16) You don't know if a passwd file is shadowed or not.
     17) You ask what is a T1.
     18) You ask how to email bomb and you think email bombing is a form of hacking.
     19) Your learning BASIC language.
     20) You think you can get into hacking straight away.
     21) You don't know how to set up an eggdrop bot.
     22) You think .mil stands sites stand for a country.

       New underground site,features sections from Hacking to the Paranormal
       This site has a lot of fluff, it looks really professional, some of the
       content however suffers due to this setup, ie: the hacking webpages text
       is covered over many html pages instead of one textfile or page for easy
       downloading, other than that this site kicks ass, be sure to check it out.
