 Welcome to my second article, which describes threads under windows. I hope,
 u will enjoy it as much as first one. Becoz things described below r not
 documented in some acceptable form and becoz I had to learn it all by
 try-mistake way, it is very possible some things won't run in future versions
 of windows (if it will even run X-D). Forgive it to me and if u will have any
 notes about this article, I would be grateful, if u'll gimme know. Thanx.
 To understand this article u must know, what's Ring-0 and Ring-3 level. There
 r many kewl tutorials about rings, so I decided to not repeat, what otherz
 already wrote. Enjoy this article!

 Threads in Ring-0, ain't it a bit crazy, eeh? :) Yeah, maybe, nevertheless
 it is possible to code Ring-0 multithreaded virus and it really worx. And as
 I said earlier, this stuff is undocumented. Don't worry, it worx on Win95/98
 now and I hope it will also work in future versions of Win95 compatible
 operating system.
 U probably ask me: "Why da fuck should I use threads in my virus?". Its
 simple. Many reasons r commented in my first tutorial "Threads and fibers
 under Win32", but here I can say, that it's one of the best anti-heuristic
 techniques. U can use threads in your Ring-0 virus. U can also use it in
 resident viruses to fuck some heuristic monitors. And using combination of
 Ring-0 and Ring-3 threads is very kewl Anti-AV technique. And also, very good
 usage of threads is as "thing in the middle" to stay resident in memory.
 System threads r present in memory, until anyone will terminate them. Ain't it
 charming? How to do it? Continue reading...

 │ 4. Creating threads in Ring-0 │
 └───────────────────────────────┘

 In Ring-3 we use CreateThread API function to create threads. This API (under
 Win95/98) doesn't call any vxd service to create thread, it does that dirty
 work on application level. If we want to create threads under Ring-0, we have
 to use vxd service, becoz we haven't access to APIs. Creating threads in
 Ring-0 is very powerful tool. We have two choices, how to do that:
 
 	-	from Ring-0 create Ring-3 thread
	-	from Ring-0 create Ring-0 thread

 Well, first things your virus has to do is:
 	-	jump to Ring-0 (IDT method, for instance)
	-	allocate some shared memory (heap, for instance)

 I assume, everything of that is already done and we can create some new
 thread now...



 4.1 Creating new Ring-3 thread
────────────────────────────────

 VMM (virtual machine/memory manager) allows us to use many vxd services,
 and one of them is VMMCreateThread service. Let's see, what Microsoft
 Windows 98 DDK says:

 OK, we have very good documentation to Ring-3 threads, which can be created
 in Ring-0, so we can start with code example:
 
 
 		push eax			;random sh!t
		push offset Callback		;address of callback routine
		push 'fuck'			;ID
		push 187h			;ES register
		push 187h			;DS register
		push offset Thread		;EIP - address of Thread proc
		push 17fh			;CS register
		push offset tstack		;ESP - address of Thread stack
		push 187h			;SS register
		VxDCall VMMCreateThread		;create thread!
		add esp, 24h			;clean stack
		test eax, eax			;thread successfuly created?
		je error			;nope ;(


 Well, now u would like to know, what sense this block of code has, rite? OK,
 I will explain it to u step by step:
 
 1)	First parameter is parameter, which will be passed to ring-0 callback
 	routine. Callback routine should contain CLC and RET instructions. It
	is long history of this and I don't think this is rite place for
	explaining it here.
 2)	Address of callback routine.
 3)	ID number of thread, which will be stored in THCB structure. This
 	should be whole system unique number, so take care with choosing it.
	THCB is also long history and it ain't important to explain it here,
	what is it.
 4)	ES, DS and SS registers has under Win95/98 187h value (Ring-3
 	selector values). U shouldn't use Ring-0 selectors.
 5)	EIP is address of new thread procedure.
 6)	CS register has under Win95/98 17fh value (Ring-3 selector value).
 7)	ESP is address of new thread stack. Don't forget, that ESP must point
 	to TOP OF STACK, so do not use:

		tstack	db	1000h dup (?)

	and use:                        	
			db	0fffh dup (?)
		tstack	db	?

	Also do not forget to have enough memory space for stack, or u can
	rewrite some data or code!

 8)	VxDCall VMMCreateThread can be also written as:
 
 		int 20h				;VxDCall
		dd	00010105h		;VMMCreateThread

 9)	This service doesn't clean stack, so u have to clean it by
 	"ADD ESP, 24h" or "SUB ESP, -24h" instruction.
 10)	U will get thread Ring-3 handle, if thread will be successfuly created.
 	Otherwise service will return NULL in EAX.


 Is it clear? If thread is successfuly created, that new thread is running
 paralelly with other threads in your system. This thread has low priority
 and will run in system until u will terminate it (whole session!). So, once
 u will create thread, it will run until u will terminate it. Thread can be
 terminated by VMMTerminateThread (00010107h) service. Problem is, that thread
 can be terminated only from Ring-0 (becoz VMMTerminateThread is Ring-0
 service). So, u can send "message" (e.g. by releasing semaphore) to your
 Ring-0 code to terminate thread. This is a bit impractic. In my Win98.BeGemot
 virus, which creates only one VMM thread at once session, is code, which will
 cause thread to sleep for whole session. The good thing on it is that u can
 simply "kill" your thread, what means that processor won't commit any CPU
 time at whole session. The bad thing is that your thread will stay present
 in memory and will still use system resources (memory). It ain't recommended
 to use it, when u dynamically creating threads. Imagine, in every activation
 of your Ring-0 will be created new thread, which will be lately killed. After
 100 activations, u would have 100 threads in memory. Choose, what is better
 for u. Here u have two examples:

 
 Sleep example:
 ───────────────
 
 New_Thread:	push -1				;never wake up
 		push 002a0009h			;thread sleep service
		call VxDCall0			;VxDCall0 from ring3 to ring0
  

 Semaphore example:
 ───────────────────
  
 Ring0_proc:	xor ecx, ecx              	;ECX = 0
 		mov cl, 0			;semaphore can be 0 or 1
	semaphore = byte ptr $-1
		jecxz continue			;0? Then continue

		mov edi, 12345678h		;push thread handle
	tHandle = dword ptr $-4
		VxDCall VMMTerminateThread	;terminate thread
		mov [semaphore], 0		;set semaphore

 continue:	VxDCall VMMCreateThread		;create new thread
		mov eax, [tHandle]
		...				;next action
		ret				;exit

 New_Thread:	mov [semaphore], 1		;set semaphore
		jmp $				;infinite loop, wait for
						;termination

 I hope this is clear.


 
 4.2 Creating new Ring-0 thread
────────────────────────────────

 Real phun is goin' here. Before I will explain u, how to create Ring-0 thread,
 I will explain Ring-0 principles. I assume, u know, what ring levels r, so I
 will talk here only about details.
 U know, that Win95/98 r preemptive multitasking multithreading operating
 system. Problem (maybe problem, maybe not) is reentrancy. Win95/98 r switching
 preemptively between threads only when they run in Ring-3. If any thread is
 actualy in Ring-0, Win95/98 won't be able to switch to another thread. U should
 know it from your previous Ring-0 programming. Try to make infinite loop at
 simple Win32 application and at Ring-0 application, and u will c, what will
 happen --> At Win32 application, Win95/98 will run on, but at Ring-0
 application, Win95/98 will halt. That's very important thing on Ring-0
 programming. So when u will create new Ring-0 thread, system will commit CPU
 time only to that thread, until thread will be finished. Remember it!
 
 In Win95/98 is one vxd service, which allows us to create "another level"
 threads. Here u have description from Microsoft Windows 98 DDK:


 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ _VWIN32_CreateRing0Thread                                                │
 │                                                                          │
 │ Provides a service for ring 0 clients to create Win32 threads that       │
 │ execute only at ring 0, which allows the use of Win32 blocking           │
 │ functions. Preserves EBX, EDI, ESI, EBP, and segment registers.          │
 │                                                                          │
 │ * Returns a Win32 ring 3 handle in EAX and a ring 0 thread handle in EDX │
 │   if successful; otherwise EAX contains 0.                               │
 │                                                                          │

 │   The size of the ring 3 stack for the thread being created. The         │
 │   recommended stack size is 4096.                                        │
 │                                                                          │
 │ * EDX                                                                    │
 │   DWORD to pass to startup function specified in ESI.                    │
 │                                                                          │
 │ * EBX                                                                    │
 │   Pointer to ring 0 function where execution starts.                     │
 │                                                                          │
 │ * ESI                                                                    │
 │   If this is a synchronous thread create, specify FALSE. Otherwise       │
 │   the value is the address of a callback procedure that is called if the │
 │   create fails. The DWORD parameter passed in EDX is passed to the       │
 │   callback procedure.                                                    │
 └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


 Now, let's have an example of code:
 
 		mov ecx, 1000h				;thread stack
		mov ebx, offset Thread			;address of thread
		xor esi, esi				;synchronous thread
		VxDCall _VWIN32_CreateRing0Thread	;Create thread!
		;...					;code continues after
							;thread termination

 Thread:	pushad					;store all registers
 		jmp tNext				;jump over three bytes
		db	3 dup (?)			;3 bytes (see below)
	tNext:	...					;thread action
		popad					;restore all registers
		ret					;and let OS to
							;terminate it
							
							
 OK, I assume, first part of code (thread creation) is clear. Second part
 ain't so clear, as it loox. Let's c, what it really does:
 
 1)	Thread will store all registers. Those register will be l8r used for
 	termination of thread.
 2)	Then will thread jump over 3 bytes. Those bytes will be l8r overwritten
 	(don't ask me why) by something(?). Really don't ask me why, coz I
	don't really know. Nevertheless, with this 5 byte long correction it
	worx without any problems.
 3)	Thread will restore all registers and quits. System will automaticaly
 	terminate thread, coz on the stack is placed address of the routine,
	which will do that.

 NOTE:	"VxDCall _VWIN32_CreateRing0Thread" can be also written as:

 		int 20h				;VxDCall
		dd	002A0013h		;_VWIN32_CreateRing0Thread
