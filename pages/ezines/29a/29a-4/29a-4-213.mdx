 Resident shields (monitors) r resident programs used to catch viruses.
 Monitors r activated, when executable files (usually) r opened, closed,
 executed, etc... Virus can be cought by monitor not only when infected file
 is being executing, but also when file is being copying. This on-line virus
 security is very efficent and many stupid users have installed some monitor.
 I will discuss here, how to deactivate some AV monitors for Win32.


 ┌──────────────────────────────┐
 │ 3. Principes of deactivating │
 └──────────────────────────────┘

 Oppositely to DOS techniques, where u have to use undocumented interrupts
 or services (and when u have several problems with deactivating in case
 monitor ain't present in memory), Win32 technique is more powerfull and
 more logic (and easier, ofcoz). Following technique is based on Windows
 message management and also stupidity of AVerz.
 Now a little teory. When u r closing a window, Windows will send message
 to program, that window is gonna be closed. And becoz Windows r message
 based operating system, u can send messages perhaps to everything, what
 exists in Windows. And if we send message "close window" to window, same
 thing will happen as we click close window button. OK, so we can close
 every closable window by sending message. And also we can close monitor's
 window by sending a "close window" message. And as I said, same thing will
 happen, as "close window" button will be pressed.
 It can't be easier...

 └────────────────────────────┘

 Firstly we have to find window, which will we close.
 We will use FindWindowA API:



    wAVP    db  'AVP Monitor',0             ;window title

            ...

            mov eax, offset wAVP            ;window title
            push eax                        ;push parameter
            cdq                             ;EDX=0
            push edx                        ;window class - NULL
            call FindWindowA                ;find window
            xchg eax, ecx                   ;swap EAX with ECX
            jecxz quit                      ;if ECX=0, quit


 If AVP monitor window exists, we have window handle in EAX register.
 Otherwise, EAX is NULL. We will use that handle to send close message:

            push edx                        ;NULL parameter
            push edx                        ;NULL parameter
            push 12h                        ;WM_QUIT message
            push ecx                        ;window handle
            call PostMessageA               ;send message!


 And AVP is away! U can close ofcoz many other AV monitors, such as
 NODICE32, etc... All u need to know is window title. But its
 very easy to find it. Just open the AV window where is placed button to
 close it and u got it! But don't expect it will work with AVs, which
 use special VxD/SyS/WdM driver(s) to provide AV chex (AVG, for instance).
 It will work with AVs, at which is after closing window all monitor's
 components erased from memory.

 Every gewd virus should contain some retro technique. And ability to
 disable AV monitor is very good retro technique, so don't forget it and use
 it in your own virus.
 Last note: When I finished this article, Darkman told me that similar
 article already exists on Virogen's page. I decided to publish it with
 following note. I didn't steal this article.
