Credit Card authorization process

I will try to show you a typical authorization process of cards given
in Visa system (with use the VisaNet system).
 
Banks serving, which have connection between their own system and with
Visa Base I system (I mean connection on-line) can send information 
across this connection. To do it they have to have special kind of 
software, making possible sending of information in special format 
required by VisaNet. Information can be send by using special 
hardware with is property of Visa. The hardware is called interface 
processor (MIP), or his smaller version which is interface processor 
installed on personal computer (MIP/PC). Main function of this devices
is activity as interface among VisaNet computer system and others
computer systems of Visa members. 
 
Serving Banks, which do not possess recommended software in their 
system, but possess MIP/PC have access to Visa Base I across special 
functions in terminal belonging to MIP/PC. It means that worker of 
bank can introduce question for authorization to MIP/PC using a key
board of this terminal. Then MIP/PC executes coding messages and 
sending it to VisaNet system. 
 
Other way of access to Visa Base I is possibility of use telex. 
Message should be send in special format to VisaNet system called 
telex interface processor (TIP). When TIP will receive message will 
start exchanging it on Visa Base I format and sends to VisaNet system.
Such solution is called Auto Telex System. 
 
We have three choice of sending message of question for authorization 
in Visa Base I system, them are: 
- Connection on-line 
- Connection across function in terminal MIP/PC 
- Auto Telex System connection to TIP 
All of them wear common name VisaNet Access Point (VAP). In chance of
transaction executed in cash machine or in electronic shop terminal, 
in which you need to put PIN code, exists necessity of coding PIN 
number. It's executed by computer cooperating with HSM (Hardware 
Security Module) which is used to safe sending of PIN code in VisaNet 
net. 
 
Visa Base I after receipt a pronouncement for authorization first 
checks basic elements of question like: it will check if pronouncement
came from recognized bank. System acts this checking Visa Base I 
identification number of operating bank. It's called BIN (Base 
Identification Number). It's six digit number sent by bank operator 
together with pronouncement for authorization, which shows to VisaNet 
system from who the pronouncement come. No one should deceive this 
this number with BIN (Bank Identification Number) number being found 
on card - they are two independent from oneself numbers possessing 
only similar name. 
 
The next step of authorization is that Visa Base I seeks out relating 
instructions how to proceed with pronouncements for authorization 
drawer-bank of card. Bank Identification Number is identical like 
first six numbers of card. Drawer-bank of card as a rule asks for 
sending him all of pronouncements for authorization - at times however
bank occupies personally only with transactions topping settled limit 
and not doing nothing with small transactions which leaves to 
independent of examining to VisaNet system. 
 
On base delivered given about transaction drawer-bank of card checks 
whether can give agreement on pronouncement for authorization. 
Additionally (if question contains coded PIN number) bank verifies 
delivered PIN number and other information delivered with this 
number. 
 
Answer - negative or affirmative - drawer-bank of card sends back  
to operator bank, which stepped out for authorization. Answer is
sent also by means Visa Base I. If bank sends affirmative answer 
adds to it generated by oneself code of authorization, which hits 
together with answer to servicer. Servicer after receipt of answer 
together with code of authorization is obliged to his inscriptions 
as a proof of sale in suitable blank space called Authorization Code. 
Of course if authorization is executed through electronic terminal 
then code of authorization will be printed automatically. 
 
All talked over process - from moment of dispatch of question for 
authorization to moment of receipt the answer does not last more than
several of seconds - without regard on distance among operator bank 
and drawer-bank of card. 
 
If drawer-bank of card does not wish oneself to receive all of 
authorization questions or if connection with bank is not possible 
(e.g. in consequence damage) then in such situation pronouncement for 
authorization has to examine by VisaNet system and VisaNet need to 
give answer in name of drawer-bank. Such situation wears name Stand-In
Processing (STIP). VisaNet system during converting authorization STIP
complies to instruction settled by drawer-bank of card. If sum of 
transaction is above certain values, then pronouncement sends oneself
immediately to drawer-bank of card - skipping of course situation of 
lack physical connections with bank. Value above of which STIP Visa 
sends question for authorizations is called Advice Limit. Except 
Advice Limit every drawer-bank cards fixes also limit of exhibitors 
which is called Issuer Limit. 
 
If value of transaction is smaller from Advice Limit, STIP Visa checks 
whether number of card is not placed in base of stolen cards numbers.
Base of stolen cards numbers is kept in Visa Base I. Data to bases 
(numbers of stolen or lost cards) are delivered by banks giving Visa 
cards. This base contains also numbers of cards on which one should 
turn special attention that are bills of cards of persons especially 
important. When number of card becomes identified from number from 
base, STIP Visa undertakes suitable activities, e.g. if number will be 
figured as number of card stolen, STIP Visa will ask servicer about 
confiscation of card. If value of transaction is higher then Advice 
Limit and smaller then Issuer Limit, then Visa again examines 
pronouncement for authorization. However in such chance process of 
transformation is a little more complicated, because except base of 
stolen cards comes checks of other base called Activity File. Activity
File contains more detailed instructions from banks putting out cards.
These instructions controls use of cards, across settlement of maximum 
numbers of use of card and maximum general sum which one can be pay
by using card in period few days. These instructions are also called 
parameters of Visa Base I. 
 
This is the end of fixing answers on authorization question, which 
will be sent to servicer.
