                           HiR 6.  In the flesh.  
._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-.

HiR is an electronic publication that is written by real hackers and phone
phreaks that have the desire to share information.  We only publish articles
related to hacking and phreaking.  We don't cover viruses, stealing, carding,
or blowing things up.  

As a general rule, we don't do many walk-thru's; occasionally we might, 
but we almost always focus more on explaining a given aspect in enough 
depth to help the reader understand why things happen.  With that 
information, they may learn for themselves and discover many other 
things related to the article.

We are always looking for new writers.  If you are (or were) in the H/P
scene, and consider yourself a decent writer, send us some of your work.
Our e-mail is h_i_r@hotmail.com.

HIR now has a much easier to remember URL, thanks to Monolith Internet.  It's
just an http redirect, (so the old URL still works) but if we end up shifting
the mag to another server ever again, this virtual domain name will redirect
you to the new site (since we have the power to modify the target URL).
The shorter url is: http://hir.home.ml.org.  Note that you will be redirected
to the old address transparently.  This is not abnormal. 

Along with the new site, we also have added a links and files page.  If we
mention any good sites in the mag, you'll probably find a link on the links
and files page.  There is a subtle link on our main page, but if you like
to have URLs, it's at http://hir.home.ml.org/hirlinks.html.
We will also put some useful shareware and freeware files on the page. Also
we add just plain cool sites, which may be overt hacking related sites, or
sites that are related to the general hacking subculture (Jolt Cola, etc.)

You can find us at the following places (that we know of):

Official HiR Distro Site Virtual Domain URL:           http://hir.home.ml.org 
Official Southwestern U.S. Mirror site:     http://azure.rcn.nmt.edu:2007/HiR
