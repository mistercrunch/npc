       HiR 6 Hacker Newz -

Website Stuph________________________________________________________________

Sorry for getting on the website so late.  We ran into some last-minute
problems with the Zine (like certain articles not getting finished, and some
other things.

On a happier note, Axon added a couple of little things to spice the site
up.  The first thing he did was to add a navbar to the top of most of the
pages.  Then, Hoolio (an HiR Reader) suggested that we come up with a
graphical Schem for the goldbox.  Axon spent a few minutes in Photoshop and
whipped out a schematic.  It's accessible through the HiR Links & Files page
on the distro site, and it's an excerpt from the Mobile hack/phreak article,
the entire section dealing with the goldbox, except the ascii schematics
have been replaced by jpegs, and I also included a picture of what a
finished goldbox looks like.

Also, Axon was looking at the site in lynx a while back ago, and noticed
that all the graphics were showing up as [INLINE], meaning that no "ALT"
properties had been set up on the images.  This has been fixed, and the
entire page is VERY Lynx friendly.

The new Links & Files page has tons of other cool stuff on it.  Be sure to
take a peek.


HiR 7's Tentative release date is Sept. 1, 1998.  Happy Hackin'!
