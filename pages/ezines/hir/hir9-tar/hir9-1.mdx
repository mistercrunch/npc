This issue, we have a new writer!  Shouts to ixl, who joins us from
Canada.  Ixl has a background in Windows 95/98, Linux, and FreeBSD.

HiR is an electronic publication that is written by real hackers and phone
phreaks that have the desire to share information.  We only publish articles
related to hacking and phreaking.  We don't cover viruses, stealing, carding,
or blowing things up.

As a general rule, we don't do many walk-thru's; occasionally we might, 
but we almost always focus more on explaining a given aspect in enough 
depth to help the reader understand why things happen.  With that 
information, they may learn for themselves and discover many other 
things related to the article.  

>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

We are always looking for new writers.  If you are (or were) in the H/P
scene, and consider yourself a decent writer, send us some of your work.
Our e-mail is h_i_r@hotmail.com or hir@axon.jccc.net.
