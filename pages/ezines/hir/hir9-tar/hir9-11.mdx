                     Hackers Information Report Issue #9
                                 Hacker Newz
                               --<*>-<|>-<*>--

Well, the HiR Crew did it once again... We've compiled yet another
information-packed issue of Hackers Information Report, and we picked up
another writer along the way!  Axon says this probably one of the funnest
issues he's been involved with since the whole thing began.  Classes are
winding down for most of the writers, and everything is turning out pretty
good so far.  Despite our slow-down in information divulging, HiR is STILL
healthy and alive, looking for more information and constantly thinking up
bizarre technologically-focused stuff to give to you, the reader.

Ixl is the newest writer in the HiR Crew.  He joined up with us about a
month ago, expressing an interest in both gaining information and taking
what he knows and learns in the future, to share it with those who will
read it (this means you).  Ixl joins us from Canada, and has recently
taken interest in Linux & FreeBSD after the typical hacker phase of
realizing "Windows just doesn't cut it all the time".

Great Newz: Axon finally got into the UNIX Administration class for the
fall semester, so in a few months, you could expect to see some Solaris
articles (and hopefully they don't decide to switch to Linux for the
class. Right now, it looks like Solaris is going to be the platform used,
and we'll see if they'll let students play with a Sun Ultra 1 or if
they'll force us to use the Intel Edition of Solaris...)

Also, as things build up before the Ultimate Gathering of Hackers in Vegas
(AKA DefCon 7), Some of the HiR Crew is again preparing for the sacred
outing.  There's no stopping us.  Rooms are reserved, and hardware has
been purchased... It looks like all three of the attending HiR Crew
Members (Frogman, Axon, Asmodian) are going to be armed with an arsenal of
one laptop and one palmtop per person.  Teehee... It looks like Frogman
got a sweet deal on a decent palmtop (in addition to the 486 laptop he's
always had), and Axon finally picked up a full-size laptop replacement,
but still uses his palmtop where a full-size laptop isn't practical.
Asmo's got the laptop and was the HiR Member to start us on the palmtop
action as well, and a lot of our equipment is gonna be network-ready on
arrival.  For those of you who make it there, try to find us... We'll
probably be handing out printed copies of the mag all the way back from
issue #1.  For those of you who aren't gonna make it: maybe next year.
Save your nickels and dimes, cuz DAMN it's worth it!  Rest assured, the
entire HiR crew is good at notetaking (and most of us are damn fast
typers, too), so there's bound to be some info in HiR 10 or HiR 11 about
defcon... hopefully we'll squeeze out #10 before defcon, though...

As we were saying earlier: HiR is alive and well, and it looks like HiR 10
will have some interesting things to offer as well.  The Crew won't ruin
it for you, but we've got some articles already in draft form, just
screaming to be expanded on, touched up, and released.  It even looks like
we'll have another writer, and maybe even a truly bizarre article
("hacking your car" ?!  That will cover simple "hacks" that give you more
Horsepower/Acceleration and stuff) but that article isn't written yet, and
may or may not show up in HiR.  I guess it falls under "ethical hacking".

Shout outs to: Palmtop computers with real QWERTY keyboards, Mountain Dew,
Barq's, Surge, Dr. Pepper, Payphones everywhere you go (for easy online
access!), and the Number 42.

This issue took a lot of pulling together from all members, and it's
probably one of the most informative issues we've released to date in
terms of the "cool stuff" department (between technical/philosophical
explanations, taking a closer look at some things, and hands on projects.)

--HiR Crew, Signing off (06/01/1999) -- Yah, We're Y2K Compliant & Stuff.
