                 (March 1, 1998: Special Ascii Edition)

Welcome, reader, to our Special Ascii Edition of Hackers Information Report.
You guys using graphical browsers to look at this will simply NOT get it.
Use a real browser (like lynx or Minuet), or download the files and look at
them with a real text viewer (none of this NOTEPAD.EXE stuff...that'll make
it look even worse).  HiR is best viewed in vi under unix, or EDIT in dos.

For those of you who have just joined us, our mag can be found at the
following places:

(Original Site)     HTTP://www.jccc.net/~ndunker/hir.html (Note the new URL)
(New Mexico Mirror) HTTP://azure.rcn.nmt.edu:2007/hir/
(TwistedinterneT)   HTTP://www.twistedinternet.com/  (look at the newz file!)

*** NEWS ***
HiR is proud to announce yet another way to get ahold of the mag, as well as
a bunch of other kick-ass information.  We're working with TwistedinterneT
services to bring you not only another place to find HiR, but grab TONS of
other goodies, information, and toolz while yer there!  See the newz file for
more information!!!

HiR is an electronic magazine devoted to the freedom of information and
technology.  We do not condone ripping people off for the sake of passing
boredom.  We are here to share the wealth of information that exists out
there, that we have either learned, or come up with on our own.  HiR makes
the best attempt to keep the content of the mag ethical.

Typically, hack walk-throughs are not provided, but information pertentant to
a systems inner workings are often discussed, allowing individuals to
deduce for themselves any other options that can be pursued with the
information.  ONLY Hacking and Phreaking issues are discussed here.  There is
no death and destructuction, no warez sites, or even virii, and especially, NO
CARDING.  These are activities which are extremely questionable when it comes
to the educational/informative side.  (We're sorry to disappoint the people
who like to blow things up...some of us like to do that too, we just don't
cover it)
