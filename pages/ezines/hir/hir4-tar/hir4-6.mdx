Mirror Sites:
As you may have read in the first file (intro/ToC) to this issue of HiR,
We're now working in conjunction with the people at TwistedinterneT services
(www.twistedinternet.com), a site that impressed the hell out of Axon while
he net surfed one day.  HiR can be found in the library, under the magazines,
on their web site.  Make sure to check out their files too (especially some  
of the unix and phreaking stuph!)  As far as the spread of information is
concerned, I haven't seen this much stuff in one place at the same time since
the death of silicon toad's page (if it's still around, mail us the URL!!! We
miss that place too!).  Proof that there is still a glimmer of hope for the
freedom of information!

The Man in Black/Rosencrantz has also provided a mirror for the southwestern
region of the united states (Physical server location is socorro, New mexico).
This is a full mirror site of the official HiR page, and contains nearly the
exact same content.

The URL is: HTTP://azure.rcn.nmt.edu:2007/HiR/      Yes, it's case sensitive.

What's with the ASCII!!??
This issue has been deemed the "Special ASCII Edition" of HiR.  All of the
article titles are ascii-ized, and some of the other parts have been created
in that wonderful high-bit character set.  If you're trying to view this in
netscape, MSIE, wordpad, notepad, or anything else graphical, it probably will
look like crap, and that's because your veiwer sucks!  Use a real text viewer
like vi or something...hell, use EDIT in dos, or pico (shudder) under unix.
If you really knew what you were doing, you'd be using lynx as your browser,
and you could read ALL this stuff online, isn't that nice?!

As usual, we need writers.  While we won't nessecarily take everything that
comes our way, I'm sure that there are plenty of hackers out there willing
to share their knowledge with others.  If you're into (or used to be into)
the H/P scene, and consider yourself a decent writer, then by all means send
some of your work to H_i_R@Hotmail.com, with your article submission attached.
The more info, the better!

Recently, while digging around in dumpsters, Axon and his friend Frogman ran
across this book that blows the motorola bible out of the water.  It was a
training book used for an employee education seminar.  Held within its 300+
pages is such a wealth of information, from programming instructions for each
motorola phone, to troubleshooting tips, a frequency / channel table for both
AMPS and N-AMPS, and ever so much more than that.  Over the next few issues,
you can expect to find quite a few articles dealing with cellular.  We will
attempt to unravel the mysteries that are clarified within it's pages.  The
original owner of the manual was even kind enough to jot down some notes in
the margins that provide even more detail.  We'll keep you posted.

This pretty much concludes HiR 4.  Keep your eyes peeled on our sites for new
and exciting things happening, as well as an update on how the newest HiR is
coming along.  Tentative release date for HiR 5 is May 1, 1998.
