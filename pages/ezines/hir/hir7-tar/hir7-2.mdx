                        HiR 7 Informative Resources

This time around, we're going to hand out a few good news sites.  These
are places whose contents are very dynamic, usually changing several times
throughout the day (but don't worry, they all archive the past
god-knows-how-many days.)  These are the places to keep your eye on if you
want to stay on top of the latest updates and fun toys.  Here we go:

Freshmeat (http://www.freshmeat.net)
News and software for the Linux user. An awesome Linux news/software
resource!

Slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org)
Another techie news site, info about Linux, Win9x, Everything
else.   Pretty Humorous, usually.  Retains the Informative nature.

Hacker News Network (http://hackernews.com)
Hacker News Network posts information on the latest web-site hacks with
lots of technical info.  It has info on Exploits and other fun stuff.  
Looks like Slashdot with a dark twist.
