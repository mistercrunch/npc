Def-Con 6.0

I could rattle on for a bit on this subject for a while but for now ill 
send greets to WW, Schemerz, Axon, Frogman, Aramadillo, and Jack the
techno dragon.  Pardon any handle mangling.  There was an even amount of
hackers to groupies.  Which was nice because then I can just blend in with
the crowd and enjoy the surroundings rather than having to deal with
obnoxious wannabes.  If you check out NY Times for day 2, you will see a
punkish looking fellow, he was in my group for capture the flag.  A
reporter also interviewed me but i didn't hear anything about again.  I'm too
tired at this point to go into much detail about it

I'll just quote from my wanna be web page about that.
&lt;EXCERPT FROM HTTP://axon.jccc.net/~asmodian/>
   While attending a massive computer convention called Def. Con 6.0, A
   writer for the New York Times once scoffed at my choice to deny him my
   real name.  He said something to the effect of, "no wonder people get
   the wrong idea about hackers, they wont even give their real name."

   That really made me think.

   At first I felt bad, I wondered if he would put the quote in the
   paper, and then wondered how my parents would feel if they read the
   article.  Now that I reflect on the situation, I was right to remain
   anonymous.

   If you think about it, your name drags a lot of people along with it.
   Your first name is what every body knows you by.  Your middle name is
   what your parents know you by.  And then there's your last name which
   hauls the rest of your family into the picture.  So if you were an
   actor, you would choose a stage name, something that wouldn't haul the
   rest of your family with you into the spot light of the world.
   Some famous stage names are (insert weird symbol here) the artist
   formerly known as prince, Madonna,
   Walter Mathau ...etc.

< end EXCERPT>

Any way, I think I made a good choice in remaining anonymous.  If you
disagree by all means blast me an e-mail at asmodianx@hotmail.com.

I also hooked AEGIS my laptop into the capture the flag network, and it
survived.  On 4 Mb of ram I would have expected it to die, but it survived
and was relitivly un-hacked (except for 1 guest account which was captured
by shoulder surfing because they user was stupid.  not Bad for Slackware
Eh!?

Something that you might want to keep in mind is to avoid plugging in power
hogging PC CARDS.  These little dudes tend to over heat when you start
sucking 1 amp, and thats WITH THE AC CORD!

As for the lateness of my articles, i must apologize, I put Debian 2.0 on
my home PC and in-advertantly fried my pub directory which houses my
submission archive... oops!?
