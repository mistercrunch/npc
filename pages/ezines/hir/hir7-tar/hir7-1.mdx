                          Post-Defcon 6.0 Issue

._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-.

Two months ago, 3 HiR Members were thrilled to be a part of Defcon 6.0,
one of the largest annual Computer Underground conventions held here in
the U.S. Axon, Asmodian X, and Frogman all attended.  Each member has 
written an article on the event, what they learned, and how they feel
about Defcon. This was the fisrt underground convention for all three of
them, so this should be interesting.  Read and find out, but don't be
surprised if you read some things more than once...

This issue was delayed by a month.  We aologize for any inconvenience this
caused.  The delay was caused mostly by a change of jobs for Axon, and
school starting up again for some of our other writers.  The job change
brought a new server for the 'zine, however.  It's now running off of
Axon's workstation, axon.jccc.net.  It's still under a directory.  I hope
that the personal pages for HiR members will be located there in the near
future.  Also, the URL we advertise, hir.home.ml.org, still takes you to
the site, as promised.

HiR is an electronic publication that is written by real hackers and phone
phreaks that have the desire to share information.  We only publish articles
related to hacking and phreaking.  We don't cover viruses, stealing, carding,
or blowing things up.

As a general rule, we don't do many walk-thru's; occasionally we might, 
but we almost always focus more on explaining a given aspect in enough 
depth to help the reader understand why things happen.  With that 
information, they may learn for themselves and discover many other 
things related to the article.

We are always looking for new writers.  If you are (or were) in the H/P
scene, and consider yourself a decent writer, send us some of your work.
Our e-mail is h_i_r@hotmail.com or hir@axon.jccc.net.
