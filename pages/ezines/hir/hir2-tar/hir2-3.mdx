I guess I'll make it a tradition now to include at least one project for
the guys who just can't keep their hands off the soldering iron.  Pardon
the cheesiness of this article.  I wrote this about the spring of 1996,
nearly a year and a half ago.  I modded this article a bit to fix some
of the bugs.  There are many things you can do with this fuscia box.  I
have one that has 2 LEDs on it, one green, and one red, with a toggle
switch instead of a pushbutton.  The Green lite turns off and the red one
turns on when you bypass the "detection circuit".  Fun.  Anyways, on with
the show..

I dunno if there is already a "fuscia box" with some other 
function than this one has, so if there is, I'm sorry.  Ain't 
heard of it as of yet.  This is so much easier to make than most 
boxes.  Almost ANYONE can do it! (Heh.  Look, even *I* can!)
I based this from an article that I saw in 2600 magazine.  I 
tweaked it a little, and made it a bit more portable. (The 
version in 2600 suggested taking apart a FONE and building it 
INTO the fone...ACK!)  Commends to "No comment" and "Crash 
Test Idiot" an their skills, to which I owe gratitude (too bad
they can't even get the part #'s right though). But I think this
will work a bit better, and a tad more portable (stick it in a
pocket!)

Heer's a phun device for those late nite boxing raids...
How would you like a device that alerted you when someone 
picked up a phone, either in yer house, or if yer beiging, in 
the house yer borrowing the line from?  Even better, if you 
attempt to hook up to a house where there's a conversation 
going on on the fone, it doesn't even let you in, so they have 
no idea anyone even tried to beige (no click,click)...now, add 
the ability to override this little device...does it sound good?
If so, jot down this parts list, an head for radio-haq...
(make sure u got a soldering iron, a screw driver, electrical 
tape, a few strands of thin insulated fone wire, and some solder,
as these will come in handy for this project...)

We'll need only a few inches of 2-wire fone base cord, and all 
u need is 1 connector, not both, If u need 2 buy a 6" cord at 
radio haq, I dunno the Cat. #, but I'm sure u can find some...

It's important that you get these specific parts except for the
switch...just make sure the switch fits inside the box without
whacking up the stuff inside. You want this specific modular jack
because It forms a nice, completely closed box, when you assemble
the wiring plate (included) with the cover, and it has plenty of
free space inside for this little project.  The rectifier and
zener diode are fairly specific to this project, due to the load
and voltage of the phone line.  Take it from me, don't substitute.
You can use almost any 2 volt LED, and any type of switch you want,
but I recommend the ones I specified, 'cause I know it'll all fit
in the box.
                               
._.>-*?HoW DoeS iT Werk?*-<._. 

For those of you who know very little about electronix, the 
whole heart of this toy is the zener diode.  What in da world 
is a zener diode?  Well, how do I say this?  Okay, it's like a 
dam, you know, for water.  If there's not enough water to 
reach the top of the dam, nothing gets through.  Well, with a 
zener diode, if there aren't enough volts, it don't let any 
electricity pass through it, and it only works one-way. have 
you ever seen water go UP a dam? (If so, get a UA...) When a 
fone is picked up, the telco "sees" it, and sends a 20 er so 
volt dial tone. If you pick up another fone on the same line, 
each fone gets only 10 or so volts...see where I'm headed.  
Remember? Our zener diode is set for 15 volts.  If 2 fones are 
on the same line, and one of them is going through this 
device, it won't let you through, and the LED will turn off, 
saying that someone else is on that line.  That's where the 
pushbutton switch comes in.  What if you don't give a rat's 
ass if someone is using the line, like, you wanna scream "GET 
OFF DA FONE!!!" or something...Easy.  Press the little 
override button, and talk...you gotta HOLD the override 
button (unless you get a toggle)...sorry (bad memories of my
walkie-talkie days...push the button, THEN talk...)  The
reason this device cuts your line, is so that if you aren't
looking at the red LED the whole time, you will still know
that you've been had.  I'd imagine there's a way to work
around the muting effect of this apparatus, but this is
easier to make.

After you get good at making these, you may just want to buy 
2 Boxes and 2 rectifiers, since everything else comes in pairs...
these DO sell, assuming you know people who would buy them.  
Don't go ready to make extras your first time, you may need 
some of those spares, believe me.  Get good at this before 
mass-producing them.

1) Read through all these instructions before you so much as
   rip open a package.  It'll help you.

2) Open up all the packages, and arrange the parts on an 
   uncluttered workbench or counter.

3) take the nut off the collar of the switch.

4) Identify the cathode of the zener diode and the LED.
   a) The Zener diode's cathode is the wire coming from the end 
      that has the black stripe painted around it.
   
   b) The LED's cathode is the SHORTER of the two wires.

5) Solder the two cathodes together, making sure not to get 
   solder on the main part of the components.  (you may want 
   to solder as close to the components as possible, and chop 
   off any extra wire.)

6) Get the Bridge Rectifier.  It has 4 leads coming out of it. 
   One of them has a + sign next to it, and the other one has 
   a - sign next to it.  solder the free end of the LED to the
   lead labeled "+", and the other free wire from the Zener 
   diode to the lead labeled "-". Notice that you have not
   done anything with the other two unlabeled leads on the 
   rectifier, yet.

7) Cut 2 strands of fone wire, about 2" apeice. Solder each of 
   these to a lead on the switch.  Screw one of the wires down
   to the red terminal on the wiring block, and solder the other
   wire from the switch to a place between the LED and zener 
   diode.  You may just want to join it in to the same place you
   soldered the LED and zener together.   
   
8) Cut off one of the connectors on the short fone cord, and 
   the outer cover, and then strip the red and green wires.

9) Cut off a few more inches of that fone wire, and strip the two 
   ends.  Solder one end to the minus sign of the rectifier,
   yes, the same place the zener diode went... solder the other
   end onto the red wire on the stripped end of the short fone 
   cord.

10)Remember the two unscathed leads on the rectifier?  Well, 
   point to one of them at random.  Now, solder another peice 
   of fone wire to that lead, and screw the other end down to 
   the red terminal, with the switch wire.

11)Screw the stripped green wire from the short cord to the 
   green terminal on the wiring block.  TADAA!  U just 
   completed the ELECTRONIC part of this thing. 

12)Drill 2 holes in the cover (for the LED and Switch).

13)Before putting the cover on, wrap all loose connections w/ 
   that electrical tape, so u don't short anything out...

14)stick the switch through the hole in the cover (omitting the
   lock-washer, and then put the nut back on the collar of the
   switch.  Push the LED through the other hole, and reassemble
   the case!

15)There should be a fone wire hanging out of the back of this 
   thing... plug that wire into a fone jack.  now, plug another
   fone into the jack on your box.  Pick up the fone.  does the
   LED light up?  If not, you screwed up. if so, your halfway
   there.

16)have someone pick up another fone on that same line.  If the
   LED turns off, and you hear the line go dead, press and hold
   the button on the box.  If the LED lights back up, and you 
   hear the line is back to normal, then it's a success!

17)Find many creative ways to use this device, and have fun!
