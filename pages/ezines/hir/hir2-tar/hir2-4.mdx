This article will cover ports.  What are ports?  Well, on most internetted
computers, especially in the UN*X world, there are MANY programs running at
once.  Many of them are servers, or daemons (pronounced "demons") as we shall
call them.  When you telnet to a host, usually you connect via TCP (Transmiss-
ion Control Protocol) to port 23, which usually services Telnet connections.
Typically, a program on the remote computer is running called "telnetd", or
telnet daemon, a program serving telnet connections.  To make this simple, I
will just list TCP functions of the ports.  (there is also a UDP &lt;User Data-
gram Protocol> function that is specified for most ports as well.  I won't
mess with these, because most of them are the same).  I fought with myself on
exactly how to put this thing together.  "Do I make it short, showing only the
really nessecary ports, or do i list all of them i have?"  I kind of made this
a compromise between the two.  This is a list of some of the most popular
ports, and most of them are all you'll need to either find out more info from
the server, obtain superuser status on the server, or bring it to its knees.
Labels marked with a * will be discussed after the list, because they offer
some interesting points of hacking interest.

Port #  Label           What it does
------  -------------   ------------------------------------------------------
1       tcpmux          TCP Multiplexer
7       echo            repeats whatever you type back to your terminal
9       discard         /dev/null  it does nothing but absorb your input
13      daytime         displays the systems date and time...fun!
15     *netstat         find info about networking structure of remote host
19      chargen         scrolls a really trippy pattern of characters
20      ftpdata         ftp data.  it's hard to explain
21     *ftp             file transfers
23     *telnet          remote terminal connection
25     *smtp            Simple Mail Transfer.  Perfect for faking e-mail!
43      nicname         whois server
53      domain          Domain Name Service (DNS) Lookup
70      gopher          Outdated way to find infos on the net.
79     *finger          Find who is on remote system (other things listed l8r)
80      http            Web Stuff (web browsers use this port to get HTML)
110     pop3            Post Office Protocol-Incoming mail
113     auth            authorization service

Some of these ports are really worth mentioning twice (some of them have 2 or
more uses!)  I guess I'll start from the top, but first, "How do i connect to
these ports?!"  As I mentioned earlier, these are all ports that use TCP.  It
just so happens that Telnet is almost a raw TCP connection, so what better to
use than telnet.  I'll assume we're dealing with a standard UNiX system here.
Typically, when we type "telnet somewhere.yermom.com" the telnet client will
default to port 23.  (how fitting, that's the "telnet" port!)  Well if you
want to connect to a different port on the same server you can simply type
"telnet somewhere.yermom.com" followed by a space, and port number such as 25
if we wanted to mess around with SMTP.  I don't really want to go into the
"how do i haxor r00t with this inph0?" kind of data in here.  If you are a
true hacker (that is defined as "not a malicous cracking leech giving the
people who know what they are doing a bad name" if you care), you will want
to play with what I have given you.  It isn't really hard to find out what
makes the box in the back office tick once you find open ports (and possibly
a good port scanner is in order...search the net, for there are tons of these
pearls swimming around in the ether out there).  On with the show...

Netstat- This port, if the connection is accepted, will give you multitudes
of information about network connections being made to and from the host.  It
shows where people are coming from, and what is going on on the network in
general.  Be patient with the data here, as it can get very cryptic at times.
try running netstat on any unix machine and looking at the results, if you
can't find a host that supports this externally.

FTP- It's a great thing to be able to snag files off of a remote host.  It is
amazing to me how many hosts allow a user to connect with anonymous FTP, and
allow them to download /etc/passwd...sometimes not even shadowed!  This has
often gotten me that little extra bit of data that I want so that I can finish
off a good hack.  Navigate as much of the system as you can, and look at
ANYTHING you run across that you can get.  This is a HUGE payoff.

Telnet- This is about as close to the front door of a host as you will ever
get without setting foot inside the server room (which would be AWESOME!).
Typically, telnetting to the "Telnet" port gets you some sort of a logon
screen, where you are prompted for a user name and password (hrm I wonder what
THAT can be used for...)  It's almost always the place you make your first
attack, and it's usually also the place you go to do your nasties after you
have some usernames (but not always)

SMTP- This is where we can do some really fun things that aren't that messy.
there are various vulnerabilities in SMTP that allow one to execute arbitrary
commands as if one were root, but I will not get into that.  I think there are
half a quintillion cookbook hacks for this out on the net, but if you aren't
lame, you'll just try to figure it out yerself.  I will however, cover how to
write some pretty kick-ass fake e-mail.

        this requires a "friends" email address, or an enemy, or someone
        you don't know.  Try it on your own email address if you have one,
        just to test it out first.

        1) telnet to a host, and make sure you go to port 25  (telnet host 25)

        2) if you get a message like "220 hostname SMTP Solarisx.x; Wed, 1 Aug
\           1997 10:19" or something like that you are in!

        3) Try this step first: type "MAIL FROM:" and then the e-mail address
           that you want this to look like it's coming from.  It doesn't have
           to be a real E-mail address either!  Just make it something phun.
           (please make sure there is a space between MAIL and TO, but not
           after the :   example MAIL TO:god@heaven.org).

        4) If you get some complaint about no HELO command, type "HELO " and
           then the host you are telnetting from.  if not, go to step 5.

        5) Type "RCPT TO:" and then the email address you want this fake mail
           to go to.  Maybe yours if you are testing it.  Follow the same
           rules as with the MAIL FROM command.

        6) It should say "Sender is Valid" and "Recipient is valid" after you
           do these commands.  if this happens, you are ready to spoof mail!

        7) type "DATA" alone on a line and hit enter.  It'll give you a shpeel
           on how to enter the message.  just remember to hit enter at the end
           of each line and you're okay.  When you are done typing, hit enter,
           type a period (.), and hit enter again.  It will then send the
           e-mail along its way, even if it's on a different host, it will
           eventually find its way.  type "QUIT" to close the connection.

        If you mailed yourself from god or bill gates or something, check your
        mail in 5 minutes or so...there it should be.

Some versions of SMTP allow you to type "VRFY " and a username, to see if
such a user exists on that host.  In example:

VRFY Jsmith
250 &lt;Jsmith@haxord.com>

had Jsmith NOT existed on the system, it would have gone like this:

VRFY Jsmith
550 Jsmith... User unknown

This is a good way to see if a user exists on a system before you attempt to
try cracking their password (like if you found some usernames and no passwords
somewhere and wanted to know if maybe those users existed on this specific
system.) This brings us to our next phun port...

Finger- this is very similar.  it is often used for gathering names of users
on a remote host.  By opening this port and hitting enter, if finger is
enabled, you get a list of who is logged on, and some other stats about their
connection.  If you type in a user's name after you connect to port 79, and
then hit enter, if the username is valid and finger is supported on the host,
you get some more detailed info on them, including a plan and project, if they
created one.  This is fairly self explanatory.  Rumor has it, that as well,
with a finger connection, by confusing the fingerd (daemon) program, it is
also possible to execute commands as root.  I'm only working on some of the
lighter duty aspects of hacking.  Like I said earlier, figure it out.


Some extra stuff:

some of you may wonder why i don't openly publish cookbook hacks for how to
swipe root access out from under the nose of unwary sysadmins.  This is a
simple answer.  if you spend a ton of time figuring it out, you will be more
careful with using it, knowing that if it is abused and the admin knows about
it, it will be fixed.  In order to keep all these hacker wanna-be's out of the
way, i figure I'll just let people know what all's out there, and if they want
to spend time messing with it, they will learn more and be careful.  I've been
on both sides of the security issue, and I love a nice equilibrium between the
two sides.
