  ▓  Volume 1, Issue #11 
  ▓  December 2001 - Twelth Release
  ░
  ░  "Reciting back their facts and numbers that don't make you smart. 
      There's much more to intelligence and thinking for yourself 
      would be a start!"

                         - Justin Sane - Anti-Flag

     Editorial::

     When I said I wanted to release another issue of the DoJ everyone told
     me to let it die. They all said "It was a great zine in its day, but         
     don't you think it's time to put it to sleep?"  Well no. I'm a strong        
     believer in the 1st amendment. And I think that this zine was open,          
     upfront, and radical. It had one of the best layouts i've seen from a        
     zine. The DoJ was the one e-zine I could read over and over and not get      
     tired of it. It was informative, clever, and sometimes really funny. I       
     personally think the zine should keep going for a new generation of          
     readers. 

     Around the time the DoJ released issue #7 the guys over at SoL started       
     doing the SoLJournal to start off where the DoJ left off.  And in no way      
     do I want this return of the DoJ to effect how the people over at the        
     SoL think of us DoJ guys.  We still love you, and support you, and we        
     hope you will support our decision to bring back the zine.  How long do      
     you think the DoJ will last? Well, who knows.  But this is the first         
     time I'm acting as editor. Before I was labeled as editor, but all I         
     really did was finalize decisions. Now im putting the zine together          
     piece by piece with the help of a select few.  If you want to see the        
     DoJ keep going write me e-mails, let me know what you think.  Let me         
     know what you thought of issues #0 through 9. Your input will help make
     this e-zine stronger.  Hopefully all the old readers will enjoy this
     issue. And I hope all the new readers that have never heard of the DoJ       
     before enjoy this issue and all the old back issues. I hope you all          
     learn something.  And remember, we're all in this together.. so keep         
     your stick on the ice.

............................:: Video Notice ::..............................

  This electronic magazine is best experienced when viewed in a text editor
  capable of displaying 80 columns in a fixed width font, that supports the
  full DOS ASCII character set.

     Windows Users:

  View the DoJ in notepad, and set the font to Terminal, 11 Points, or view
  in command line editor, on full screen mode.

     X11 Users:

  you can download an x11 compatible font from fwaggle.net/terminal.pcf,
  install this font in the misc fonts directory, run mkfontdir, then set
  your x11 terminal emulator or text editor to use this font. (or you can
  use the nexus font, popular with bitchx users)

  Please note that this character set is old, and all computers _should_
  support it, but they don't. It's not our fault that guis mess everything
  good up....

     Unix Console Users:
  
  The DoJ will appear great in an editor like joe, or for people like
  bedlam, use cat &lt;dojfile.txt> | less -r to see our artwork in all it's
  glory!
