The Discordant Opposition Journal
by cronus [cronus@iol.ie]


I am going to try and give a history of the DoJ since its inception,
illustrated in its full horror.

Issue #0 (Release One) was born in early November of 1998 when
myself (cronus) and Rue-the-Day found ourselves with too much
time on our hands. Both in school at the time, certain books had
spawned a mutual interest in Discordia and the teachings associated
with it. So getting the Discordant Opposition's backing of the zine
wasn't too hard and seemed like a logical move.

The first two issues rolled out with little following - we hadn't
gotten the word out well enough so submissions and (fan) mail merely
trickled in. To deal with this lack of interest Feburary of 1999 saw
the Discordant Oppositions (with me and Rue in the flanks) take a
stand against Moroccon human rights crimes. This issue also saw the
Knights of Dynamic Discord stepping into the limelight somewhat.
To quote;

        'No one deserves this and we who are able to, should
         fight for their rights. The Knights of Dynamic Discord
         hereby declare information war on the infrastructure
         of the Moroccan Government.

         All Hail Discordia !'

         -Issued by Deadpool and eccentricMind (KoDD).

This move was labeled as everything from a headline-grabbing stunt
to a criminal threat. Suffice to say that the Moroccan government
had no infrastructure to attack so the information-warfare launched
by the KoDD was entirely sucessful. Netiziens flocked to join the
staff of the DoJ as permanent writers or part-time helpers.

The fourth issue saw the DoJ move into more financially based
ventures with Digital Avatar shifting his involvment from assistant
editor to the zine's PR manager. Also Kleptic came onboard in a more
complete way as an in-house Doctor.

March of 99 had Rue moving his political alignment from Discordia
to Anarchy (in a bit of a backwards step) which only fueled debate
among DoJ followers about the zines shaky future.

Issue #7 (Release Seven) was a milestone for the DoJ as Rue-the-Day,
one of the founding fathers, decided to leave the scene. Grave faces
littered the hollow halls of the Discordant Opposition, but the
decision was made to breath new life in the zine rather than letting
it die. Onward and upward it went...

At least that was the idea - lack of interest and lack of time, me
being the only editor. The DoJ suffered a slow lingering death with
the staff making a concious attempt to try and harvest articles and
continued support. But to no avail...

Kleptic, RELM and Koala9 took the reigns with a view to keeping the
DoJ spirit alive as long as possible. One release was all that the
trio managed and the DoJ slipped into a years slumber.

Awoken feeling fresh and rejuvinated, the DoJ was kicked, beaten
and molested into shape by Kleptic and fwaggle. They managed to only
put together 2 issues together. Until fwaggle became occupied with "life."

Sadly the DoJ fell asleep yet again, for another year. But awaken by Kleptic.
Kleptic wanted to do a website with texts and whatnot, similar to DoJ style
works. But more of an archive. But after a while of constant "when is the 
DoJ going to be coming back with a new issue?" He decided to kick the idea 
around with some old DoJ writers. And with the support of a few and the raving 
of others, he decided to ignore those that oppose and go on with the release of
 a 11th issue (issue #10 in DoJ time).

The future of the DoJ should be a bright one...
