A Plea For Peace
----------------
By: skwert


"What are we fighting for?!" When a war happens -- sometimes this is the last 
question asked by the people, but it should be the first. I will say 
optimistically that most of the time it is, and people actually value what they
are fighting for. 

The reason I say that "What are we fighting for" should be the first and 
maybe even the only question asked is because wars communicate what a country
or group of people values. If this question is not asked their values and cause
could be misinterpreted.

ItÆs very much like a speech or a paper - when writing it or saying it the 
sender needs to have a specific reason for writing it. Hopefully, they are not
talking or writing just for the sake of being heard or hearing themselves talk. 

If the message is not known by the sender how the hell is the receiver supposed
to decipher it.
 
So, just to clarify my motivation for saying this to you - I am telling you 
what war communicates so you might think about what our country fights for -
and if it is really worth it. If you truly value what message is being sent -
or if you even know.

When asking the question "what are we fighting for?" I always think first 
of religious war. Religious wars have been raging on for centuries, yet most 
religions believe in the exact opposite - they believe in peace, unity and 
forgiveness. Most atheists, agnostics and others without a religion are that
way for the very reason that the message communicated through wars, riots, etc.
By religious people is hypocritical.

The crusaders believed they were on a quest for God. They were to show the 
rest of the world monotheism. So, when I first thought of this I realized 
"actions speak louder than words," it is empirically proven. Actions are a HUGE
part of communication. So the message they tried to get through with violence
was drown out by the voice of their violent actions. Many people turn away or
are driven from religions because of actions.

Yet other things are communicated through war, not just religious beliefs. 
The United States continually sends out the message that money is more
important than human life. Each war they have gotten involved in since W.W.II,
at least, has shown exactly that. Vietnam is a perfect example of the inner
conflict between the people and their leaders. If people only realized the
power they truly carried, but unfortunately not enough do yet because they are
comfortable.
 
Vietnam made people uncomfortable because they asked the question "what are we
fighting for?" and got back an answer that didnÆt satisfy them.

The United States was by no means always like this, valuing money over 
human life. They used to fight for worthy causes in most citizenÆs eyes. The 
revolutionary war fought by the United States was seen as just such a cause. 
There were acceptions to those who agreed, but the majority saw it as a "worthy
cause." They saw it this way because they had tried to talk Britain into
letting go of them, and that didnÆt work. Then after many debates about what
they were fighting for, they turned to war. People died so others could be
"free." The US was communicating to the world that they were strong enough to
govern themselves and ideally anyone could make it to the top in their
political system because it was a democracy with capitalism.

The question I would ask now is, "Is the US really a democracy? Are they 
really a government of the people, by the people, and for the people?" Back in
the day, when Lincoln became president and maybe up until all presidents
started being rich senators, I think the United States was an almost perfect
democracy. It had its flaws just as anything, but it ran a lot better than it
does today.

The United States, today, I would like to think, has Unintentionally made 
other countries think its sole purpose is money. Anyone on top has money;
anyone in a leader position has money; anyone whoÆs anyone has money, and there
are few acceptions. The majority of the time, do these people with money truly
represent "the people?"
 
The rest of the world seems to think so. Maybe its time we talk to the 
government officials and see what they think. We are not the only country
communicating a message, though. All countries just as all people, all the
time are communicating. They are sending out a message that says, "We believe
this, we value that...." War helps this message be brought out stronger, and
sometimes war completely changes the way other countries view those involved
in the war.

War is not always waged between two different countries. Civil wars 
communicate to the rest of the world the fact that part of the country believes
and values things differently. In all wars, both sides believe they are
right.
 
Their cause is good enough to die for. So, no matter who wins the battle, the
war still rages on. Just because one side loses the war, doesnÆt mean they
will change their mind. It will probably make their conviction all the more
stronger. They believe their cause is right.

Communication is a huge part of avoiding physical conflict. True, different 
countries speak different languages, have different religious beliefs, etc. But
they obviously understand each other enough to disagree on something. The fact
is they are communicating, but the communication needs to extend farther. I do
see some instances that maybe another country should step in, such as a teacher
separating two kids in a fight. But realize this teacher must not take sides,
or the conflict is all the worse. They should just separate the two and say,
"Hey, whatÆs the deal?"
 
And send them to the principle, he will decide how to discipline the two 
fighting kids and not the teacher. This should be the same when races, different
beliefs, or even countries fight. Instead of the US or someone else stepping in
and taking sides (deciding whoÆs side to fight on) the semi-authority figure
should pull the two "fighting children" apart. Then, not take the situation
into their own hands, unless absolutely necessary.

There is an international court if no negotiation can be made. The fact is the
country that steps in SHOULD be neutral. There should not be money or anything
else involved so they would want to take sides. This is for obvious reasons.
For communication reasons, if they feel they might be tempted to take sides,
they shouldnÆt be involved. Just as fighting couples do not usually go to a
counselor that supports one story more than another, that is if they truly want
to solve the problem.

Take for example the Middle East. If another country were to step in a try 
and solve it - it wouldnÆt work, it hasnÆt yet - with peace treaties etc. The 
agreement must be made by the people or nothing will change. The Palistineans 
and Israelis have a chain of hate and it just keeps getting passed down from
generation to generation. Many times it has happened that war is passes from
one generation to the next. Attitudes and ideals are usually inherited by the
younger generation because they have grown up hearing it. 

Jesse Micheals (the lead singer/song writer of former Operation Ivy) noticed
this and wrote it very well in the song "Room without a window." He noticed the
close-mindedness of the younger generation that kept the ball rolling, he
wrote:
 
"Walls made of opinions, through which we speak and never listen. 
Ceilings made of pride, vicious and self satisfied. 
Door thatÆs made of rage, hard and slowly aged. 
Always closing tighter with every war thatÆs waged." 

Most of the time second and third generation warfare is very much like this.
They refuse to look outside the walls, to see it in a different light. 
The fact is, war communicates many things. But there is something else that 
matters more than the message being sent, that is that there has never been a 
war that solved anything. Although the US declared its independence from
England it still had its problems. War may seem to temporarily remove the
stain, but if a war ever did really solve a problem that would be the end of
all wars.

The problem with war is: In war someone has to lose. The war isnÆt truly to 
a stopping point until both sides agree . . . but usually one side gives in or
decides the cause is not worthy of war. An agreement is hardly ever made. 
Because one side gives in they are declared the "losers" because both sides
whole heatedly believed in their side. So, next time you are thinking about
supporting a cause, not only ask the question, "What are we fighting for?" But
call to mind what John Tunic wrote in His Enemy, His Friend. "If we
keep feed on these hatreds handed down to us by our ancestors, where are we? 
What good are wars? Who ever won a war? Who ever profited from them in the end?"


- UNITE!
