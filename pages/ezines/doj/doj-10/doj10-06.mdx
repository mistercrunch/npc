Defeating parental control software
===================================
By:  Kleptic - kleptic@grex.org
===================================


The goal of parental control programs is to allow parents to monitor their
children's Internet use and keep them from accessing pornography or other
information deemed, "unsuitable for children." To accomplish this, most parental
control programs use a combination of banned Web lists and URL scanning.

The banned web lists simply contain web sites that the makers of the parental
control program consider unacceptable for children to view, such as the Condom
Country site (http://www.condom.com), the Playboy site
(http://www.playboy.com), or the Hustler site (http://www.hustler.com).
Because new websites appear everyday, publishers of these programs must
constantly update their lists of banned websites to maintain their programs'
effectiveness (and users of parental control software must constantly download
these updated lists to keep their programs updated).

The second form of defense, URL or content scanning, works by examining the
words in a URL address of the text on the webpae. SO if you type in a URL that
contains an offensive word such as "love," "sex," or "nude," or the page you
access contains certain words, the parental control program assumes the URL
points to a pornographic Website and refuses to grant you access.

Ironically, many parental control programs also block access to websites that
list books banned by various schools, such as the On-line books page website
at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/People/spok/banned-books.html (the site might not be
up anymore). This can be useful in case parents don't want their children to
read anything that might be offensive, such as classic novels, encyclopedias,
or dictionaries that define obscene terms.

But URL scanning is not without its flaws.  It can often be beaten by typing
in the numeric website address rather than the more descriptive URL. Even
worse, URL scanning can often block innocent websites that contain suspicious
words such as "hot," (such as a Website adervising hot chili), "girls," (such
as a website loaded with info on girl scout cookies), or even "X-" (such as a
fan site for X-Files).

To lean how to defeat parental control programs such as NEtNanny, CyberSitter,
and Cyber Patrol, visit the Glen L. Roberts "Nurse Your Net Nanny" website at
http://www.glr.com/nurse.html.  Here you can find instructions or actual
programs for disabling parental controls software. 

Although parental control programs work as advertised, they present a curious
paradox. Because kids often understand computers better then their parents,
it's easy to imagive that some parents won't be able to install a parental
control program correctly in the first place. And most parents will think that
parental control programs alone can keep their children safe from forbidden
websites on the Internet. 

 
Well thats all for now..
