For everyone who thinks that hacking only involves programming languages and
knowledge of networking this is for you.  Hacking as a whole requires alot more
than just an exploit or an uninformed administrator.  Some of the most
successful hackers out there all have one trait in common.  That is the ability
to talk their way into any situation (talking your way out is much more
difficult it seems hehe).  The best, and easiest way to get into a system can be
broken down into 3 simple steps, 1. lie  2. cheat  3. steal.

1. Lie - Depending on the situation or what you want out of it determines
exactly what you have to say.  Pass yourself off as someone or something your
not (easy for all you wannabes who do it daily to other hackers who can easily
pick out a bullshitter).  In a situation like trying to get free hosting on a
server or a free shell account to do your work from you can try and say
something like "I work for a hardware supplier and I can get you free and/or
cheap stuff"  usually good for a little bit before they want you to own up.

Just go with what you know (or don't know) but stay away from areas that you
have absolutely no clue about.  For example, don't try and pass yourself off
as a network admin if you don't even know what a token ring is.

2. Cheat - Create something off the fly or ask someone to do it for you.  In
the case that someone wants something from you and you don't know how or where
to get whatever it is, find a way to get it.  Like trying to get into a rather
large company to take a look at their equipment or to take something out to
"service" it.  Make sure you have the proper attaire and equipment with you
and forms of I.D.  Believe it or not, this is easier than it sounds.  I've done
it quite a few times and have been in and out of the local telephone switching
board to grab some things that I need.

3. Steal - Now, before you go through this step, remember that if your caught
you have two sides to worry about.  One is the company/person you're trying to
fraud, and second is the person who's work you stole.  Ok, basically it's
simple, take someone else's hard work and pass it off as your own.  Remove copy
right protection (if any) and wipe out anything that would show that it's not
yours.  Then give detailed information about what it is and how much effort you
put into it (yeah right).  Impress them with what you seem to be able to do.

  Basically steps 2 and 3 tie into step 1.  If you have good social skills, or
just an excellent bullshitter in general, you can go pretty damn far.  Take
Kevin Mitnick for example, very ingenious person, able to pass himself off as
just about anything or anyone.  Hell, he could probably get someone to believe
he was bill gates.

You can cut down the risk of exposure especially if you practice these things
in another city, or better yet another state/country.  Just make sure you do
the background work.  This isn't easy stuff, but then nothing is.  If you do
your homework you'll do pretty darn good.  Well that's pretty much it for now.

  I'll write something a bit more informative in the future, that I can
promise you, everything else, well that all depends on my mood.  Good luck guys.
