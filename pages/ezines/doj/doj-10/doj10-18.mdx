racism goes two ways....

i'd like to begin this text by making it clear i'm anything but racist... the
thought that one race or group can better themselves by pushing another down
disgusts me. the very idea that anyone would be beaten or killed for being
black disgusts me.

but this text isn't about the regular viewpoint of racial equality. this is
about some finer points that really piss me off, but never seem to hear the
light of day... these problems never seem to be expressed, and if they are,
it's by racist assholes so they fall upon deaf ears.

the problem in my eyes is that in too many peoples minds, "racial equality"
means "be nice to african-americans" (replace african-americans with any
"minority" race of your choice). that's not what it's about at all, it's about
all races being treated equally, regardless of skin color, face shape, or
religion.

so why is it that it's such a big offense for a white person to call an
african american a "nigger", but african-americans use the word freely among
each other? i personally hate the word, i think it's hateful and down-putting.
but why is it taboo among one race, but not another? is that your idea of
racial equality?

if you think it's fair, "because they're black", look at it from this point of
view. is it fair for a partially handicapped man to look a little boy
suffering from cerebral palsy straight in the eye and say "you spastic",
simply because he suffers the same affliction? i think not. there are
african-americans out there who dislike the abovementioned "n word" just as
much as me, yet their "brothers" use it freely...

furthermore, it's such a huge issue to call an african american "black" in a
hateful manner. this i can understand... but what of when they call white
people "white" in a hateful manner? nothing is done. the police and security
guards of malls are powerless to stop them, because of their reputation with
dealing with minority races, everyone thinks they're racist to begin with...

take for example, a group of african americans at a mall... a young caucasian
lady (who i do not know and haven't talked to her, and will therefore remain
nameless) walks nearby, minding her own business. one of the african-americans
basically yells "look at that white bitch, i bet she got some pink pussy". she
turned around, visibly insulted, and dropped the "n word". suddenly, it's a
race issue! is this what you call racial equality?

another scenario. my wife and i were about to purchase tickets for sacramento's
light-rail train system. we walked past an african american hobo selling
obvious counterfeit tickets. as we start putting our money into the machine -
where it belongs - he says "that's it give your money to the white man". listen
you racist mother fucker, we were putting our money where it belonged so we
didn't get hauled off the train for fare evasion... it wouldn't matter if you
were white, yellow, red, of fucking green - i wouldn't have bought tickets from
you!

this is the exact thing that pisses me off. for a group who want so desperately
to be treated equal in this country, african americans sure like to serpate
themselves when it suits them.

i'm not saying that this is the entire black race that's to blame. i have
every respect for many upstanding african americans, and i do not base my
opinions of people on the color of their skin, i base it on how they act
around me. 

but these small groups of "stupid gangbangers" in my own description, MAKE me
want to use the abovementioned n word. they're developing a racial hatred
inside me, which if i was any more stupid, i would begin harboring, and who
knows what would happen!

the police are powerless to stop this kind of bullshit, because they've made
asses of themselves in the past. the politicians are powerless, because it
would turn into a race issue and be political suicide. so i guess it's up to
a few quiet voices...
