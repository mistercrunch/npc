Miscellaneous Fiction - by Skratchnsnif

The stories which I write are fiction. The events which take place in them are
completely made up, and any similarities to real life events is completely
coincidential. However, these stories are designed to portray hacking as it
really is. Not galmourous, fun, and colourful. These are stories of green/grey
screen, text based, REAL hacking.

If just one newbie reads one of my stories and doesn't take up hacking, because
he/she knows it's not cool, then my job will be a success. Where possible, I
have paid every attention to true details. This ain't no Hackers movie.

Anthony breathed out labouriously. He set the syringe down on the desk beside
him, rubbed his weary eyes, and stared at the clock. 3:17am. He tapped a few
keys on his keyboard, and heard the harsh yet relieving noise of his modem and
a distant modem negotiating their connection.

He waited for the chat script to finish negotiating his connection, blinking
his eyes. Suddenly, a loud bang as the door burst a tiny bit open - stopped
only by the security chain. Anthony quickly flicked the syringe into the open
drawer below it, and slammed the drawer shut. An instant later, his mother
burst in the door, having broken the security chain.

"You little bastard, how many times do I have to tell you, people should be
asleep at this time. Then your deadbeat friend knocks on our fucking door!"
She pushed Ben through the door somewhat heavy handidly, then slammed it
behind her.

He could hear her through the door and walls. "Fuckin kids. Stay up all
night. See if I give a shit." He could still hear her walking back to bed.

"Dude, you loaded?" Anthony waved the syringe to Ben. "Yeah, man. I'm stoked."

Ben pulled the 486 laptop from his backpack, and set it on the table. He
plugged his modem into a makeshift telephone jack, which Anthony had screwed
to the wall. "So nice of your dad to lend me his fax line."

As Ben got set up, Anthony was already in action. He retrieved a list of open
proxies on cable internet machines, scanned down the list and stopped at a
random address. He telnetted to this address, before bouncing off it into
another. Finally, he pulled out a seperate sheet of paper, and entered the
address from it.

He logged in to a box somewhere in Japan. Next, he used the su command to
jump up to root privilidges. A quick "who" on the system confirmed. No one
awake except him.

She stomped on the floor, climbing out of bed and storming accross to the
bathroom. "Bitch," Jayson muttered under his breath as he continued opening
his laptop, still laying in bed. He scratched his chin, waiting for the machine
to boot up. His hands smelt of her.

"You know," she began, flushing the toilet then stomping back into the bedroom.
"Only a fucking nerd would jump straight on the computer afterwards."

"You know where the door is," he replied, matter of factly. "Fuck you. I'm sick
of your bitching."

"You know it's past curfew. I'd get picked up being out this time of night.
Just put the fucking thing away and lets get some sleep. Is that so much to
ask?" She lit a cigarrette, and stood with authority at the end of the bed.

Jayson flicked the brightness down on the passive matrix screen, set the laptop
on the bedside table, and rolled over. She climbed gently over the bed and lay
down next to him.

Anthony dropped out of the root account, settling into his stolen user account.
He loaded telnet, and made a connection from Japan to a telnet "talker" in the
UK. He joined a hidden channel called "WatchTower", and found himself alone.

Moments later, the noise from Ben's carrier dissapeared. He logged in, and
bounced off his own set of WinGates, this time straight into the Talker.

--> XOR has joined WatchTower.
--> neb has joined WatchTower.

They waited, somewhat bored. Passing time. Wasting time.

"spyder" sat with a blunt in his mouth, squinting at his screen. It was 7 am,
and he hadn't had any sleep. He really needed it, the lack of sleep and the
effects of the smoke both taking their toll on his senses. The $ prompt sat
staring at him, almost taunting him. You can't make me go away.

He desperately wanted this box. Noone he knew had access to this much
bandwidth, and a super fast processor. He pondered about the speeds it would
perform password cracking. He found himself sitting blankly, that $ prompt
still staring at him.

He scanned the binaries directories for possibly exploitable programs. He
needed to find something which would run suid root. He saw it. xfs. He'd
remembered seeing an exploit for this, and wondered if it was currently
running. Surely someone wouldn't be wasting a server as powerful as this by
using it as an X workstation?

He ran ps ax, and saw it. It was running. The admin was an idiot. He knew this
operating system version was vulnerable to this form of attack. Why didn't he
just try cat the shadow file to begin with?

He typed ls -l /etc. There it was. Staring at him. Four days of racking his
brain, and there it was, pointing and laughing...

-rwxrwxrwt   1 root     root          544 Mar 30 00:04 /etc/shadow

He started his telnet logging, and cat'ed the shadow file, his fingers
slightly trembling. The stopped logging, Wait, might as well grab group as
well. He logged out, fully aware that the admin would be coming online within
an hour.

spyder ftped the shadow file accross to his linux machine, then opened a telnet
session to it. He executed his password cracker.

in southern australia, a beat-up bedford van slinked down a dark suburban
street. it pulled over to the curb, the headlights extinguished, and the engine
silenced. a late-teenage man climbed out of the van, and turned up his collar.
he looked back, then to the front of the van, before grabbing a small chrome
wrench and a coil of thin cable from the seat of the van.

he walked slowly through the dense undergrowth of a large bushy vacant lot,
uncoiling the cable behind him as he went. he reached the other side of the
lot, where he stopped at a tall green cylinder shaped object.

he took the wrench from his pocket, and inserted it into a hex shaped lock.
he twisted the wrench a quarter of a turn, and the cylinder split open in half.
he crouched down in front of it, and took a phone looking device from his
pocket, with a length of cable and two "alligator clips" on the end of it.

he held the phone device, known as a "lineman's handset", on his shoulder
with his head cocked, and touched the two clips onto two matching terminals
inside the cylinder. he heard activity. he moved to the next. nothing. he
removed two of the wires from the terminals with precision, and moved them
to the side. next, he twisted the exposed ends of the cable he'd drawn from
the van, and connected it to the terminals, before tightening the screws.

he moved briskly back to the van, looked forwards and backwards, before
opening the door and climbing in. as he climbed to the back of the van, he
already heard the engine of the van start, and a modem carrier squealing in
the back. he climbed in and sat on a beanbag, watching lights flicker on a
rackmounted server in a rack screwed to the wall of the van. 

as the modem negotiated it's carrier, the two men and a young womam shuffled
in their beanbag chairs, tapping away at their laptop keyboards.

Jayson climbed out of bed, secure in the knowledge that his girlfriend was sound
asleep. He grabbed the laptop, a pack of cigarrettes, and walked over to the
couch. He flopped on the couch, opened the laptop, and lit a cigarrette.

the laptop was already booted, so he opened his telnet client...

haunting grunge music began playing inside the van, barely audible outside, as
three hackers began attacking a large educational network in the US. they treaded
lightly, but they weren't taking any chances. their call would be traced back to
some person's house, and in this neighbourhood the owner of the line probably
didn't even own a computer.

it was about 1 in the morning, and the isp they'd dialed into would be unmanned
at this point. in the front of the van, another late teen man sitting in the
driver's seat, scanned the view from the windshield and in the rear view
mirrors.

the three australian hackers continued attacking the network until early in the
morning. it was a game, which one would find their way in first? would any of
them breach the network? or would they go home empty handed?

the female of the trio - "lil`devil" - stretched her face muscles, battling to
stay awake. she flicked her tongue-stud out and held it in her lips, toying with
it. the amphetamines were wearing off, and she knew she'd be asleep soon.

she switched windows to her ATerm, which was running a perl script of her own
invention, which attempted to crack arbitrary accounts on the server using brute
force. it had been running on a remote shell for nearly 4 hours. the sun was
beginning to come up.

"f1sh", the older of the male hackers was also feeling the effects of his
body's reaction to the speed wearing off. he tilted his head back, shut his
eyes, and for a minute, almost fell asleep.

lil`devil bit her lip. her cracker's ATerm was blinking. visual alert. it had
beeped. it only beeps for one reason. the cracking program had forcibly cracked
the password to a user account, "denverp". peter denver, an admin on the
network. the trio were reliably informed that he would have trusted privilidges
on the network.

"yes" she breathed quietly. the others didn't hear her over beating music, but
she knew she'd cracked it. unfortunately, they would have to work together,
exploit the privillidges (if they existed), and clear up the logs before
denverp logged in. the next day was a saturday, it was doubtful he'd log in,
but the possibility was there, and it was real. time was of the essence.

she raised both hands in the air. the stereo silenced. "i got it, i got
denverp. now let's find those trusted hosts", she gave them both the password,
and they checked host after host. what they were looking for was a trusted host
which they could log into easily, but with less security than the well guarded
firewall machine.

<-- spyder has left the channel
--> spyder has joined the channel

spyder> damn
neb> what happened?
spyder> no clue, connection timed out.. freaky yo
neb> yo yo yo if i hear you say yo once more....
XOR> i'm bored. i need something new. wonder if dad'll get me a sparc for xmas

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

f1sh scratched his goatee, lil`devil continued playing with her tongue stud. the
first hacker, "spud" continued typing, and waiting, typing and waiting. he
compiled an exploit, tried it, it failed, so he deleted it.

this continued on for quite some time. finally spud's heart skipped a beat, and
his lungs stopped in his chest. there it was staring at him, a # prompt. he'd
managed to get root on this box. as a reliable contact had promised, the rest of
the machines on the network trusted the root user from all the other machines.

the hackers were free to login as root on any of the machines. he picked a
machine on the network which he figured would have the least chance of denver
logging in. he changed the root password, then relayed the information to his
buddies.

now begins the final part of the operation. the cleanup. f1sh installed
rootkits on all the machines, a utility which hides obvious evidence of a root
comprimise. spud and lil`devil spent their time racing around the servers
clearing out their entries from the wtmp files and their relatives. they just
generally removed any evidence of their attacks (including the sizable logs
generated by her brute force cracker).

spud also installed a module in the apache server, of his own design. it was
designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, but it allowed certain urls to be
sent to the server and allow him to run arbitrary commands as the httpd user.
next, he set up a small exploit program which the server could run, but it would
use root privilidges, to enable them to retake the server at any time should
they be discovered.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Jayson was quickly growing bored. He decided to try telnetting to f1sh's "0wned
box" in the UK, and see if he was around. He did so, and sure enough, f1sh was
on. He tried to "talk" him. No answer. f1sh wasn't dumb enough to leave himself
connected overnight. 

He tried again, and again. Still no answer.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The trio were just finished up the clean up operation, when several plain
Mitsubishi sedans zipped past, jerking the driver of the van awake. He looked in
the rear view mirror and saw the cars all swerve around the corner two blocks
down.

"Heads up," he said. Three plain cars just flew past. I think someone's onto us. 

The three hackers made their final clean up attempts, before logging off. They
powered down the server, cut the cable hanging out the door, and just generally
put everything away. The van pulled slowly away from the curb, accellerating
away.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Jayson sighed. f1sh had gone offline. He closed his laptop, walked over to the
bed and climbed back in. His companion groaned slightly in her sleep, before
rolling over and wrapping her arm around him. He fell asleep pretty soon.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The three unmarked police cars crawled to a halt in a poorly lit dusk street.
The officers climbed out of their cars, and walked speedily two houses along
before climbing the steps of a decrepit house.

On an under-breath count of three, the officers kicked the old flimsy wooden
door off it's hinges, and burst into the house yelling "freeze" and "police"
repeatedly. They found... An elderly lady sitting watching early morning
television. She stared at the officers, stunned. Their comrades searched every
room in the house. Nothing.

They simply stood around scratching their heads. Hackers 1, Cops 0.

This is as far as I'm going this issue, fwaggle's nagging me for this text. I'll
probably continue this tomorrow, and you'll hopefully see the results next issue!

Have fun, and keep it real.
