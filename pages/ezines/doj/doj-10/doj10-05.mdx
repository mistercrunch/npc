 / Cold Fusion - A Primer /
/========================/
24 December 2000 by "Timeless"

 _______________
/ Introduction /
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When web servers first became popular on the 'Net, it was mostly just to serve
up static web pages. Gradually people saw the potential of making web sites
"dynamic", having the ability to give a more interactive and personal
experience to the surfer. This spawned the need for web servers to be able to
integrate their functionality with custom-made programs. So the Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) was created which would allow programmers to create web-based
applications. Special web pages could be requested which would actually run a
program instead of just handing out a web page to the user. The program would
create HTML code on the fly and send it back to the web server software, which
in turn gets returned to the user's browser software over the 'Net.

However, with new solutions there are new problems. When a CGI program is
called, a whole new instance of that program (and sometimes it's interpreter
too) needs to start up in the computer's memory. It would initialize itself
each and every time, it would re-connect to databases each and every time,
and also tidy up afterwards... yes, you guessed it... each and every time.
This simply put way too much load on the web servers, especially on busy web
sites. Load balancing was very crude and expensive in those days too, so an
alternative had to be invented.

It was decided that the web application software could start up at the same
time as the web server software, and only be shut down when the web server
was stopped. To allow for this kind of functionality, various web server APIs
(Application Programming Interfaces) were created, namely: ISAPI (for IIS web
server), NSAPI (for Netscape's web server) and WSAPI (for Web Site Pro's web
server). At the same time Apache web server was just starting to get popular,
and it used a similar mechanism but the integration was done through
"modules".

Now, web application programmers could create fast and efficient software that
need only initialize once and could serve many concurrent web users without
having to have an enourmously powerful computer to handle the resources.
Remember that new solutions bring new problems? It turned out that writing
server API code was very complex. Programmers needed to be very aware of
multithreading and simultaneous processes and all the potential problems
arising out of their use. So some programmers started building standard
server API software that could be scripted later without having to worry
about how it all works inside the "black box". This way, programmers could
concentrate on writing the business logic of the web application itself.
This idea gave birth to a whole new bread of software called Application
Servers. Microsoft created Active Server Pages (.asp script files), Allaire
created Cold Fusion Application Server (.cfm script files) and Sun
(I think) came up with Java Server Pages (.jsp script files). Later on,
PHP was born and used a language very similar to Perl for it's scripting
language.

Each application server technology was very similar to the next in the way
the code was run. The surfer would use their web browser software to request
a page off a web server over the 'Net. The web server software would check
to see if it was a dynamic page that needed processing by the application
server software. If so, the page would get processed and all server-side
scripting code would get removed from the resulting web page before
returning it to the web server software. The web server would then send
the page back to the surfer.

 _____________________________________________
/ Introducing Cold Fusion Application Server /
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cold Fusion Application Server is currently built to run on Windows 98/NT,
Solaris, Red Hat Linux and HP/UX. It makes use of core server API provided
by the leading web server software developers (Apache, Microsoft, Netscape,
O'Reilly). It is often dubbed "the glue" when it comes to bringing together
various internet-enabled services. It is completely extensible, which means
that if it can't do it already a programmer can probably get it to do it
with a bit of his own code. It comes out of the box with the ability to
"talk" HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, SMTP, ODBC, natively to some other databases such
as Oracle, LDAP, XML, Radius Authentication and FTP to name just some of the
more important ones. It has the ability to integrate into the operating
system itself allowing use of the file system, program execution, system
registry, etc. All protected by an advanced security system that suits both
single project web servers and multi-client web application hosting. It is
completely scalable and is very well suited to Enterprise-level web
applications (check out www.afternic.com for example - .cfm is everywhere - and
those boys get some serious hits!). Cold Fusion Application Server even has the
built-in ability to do software-based load balancing, and hardware-based load
balancing is also possible too (speaking from experience).

 _____________________________________________
/ Enough About The Intro, Let's Look at Code /
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To demonstrate how easy this language really is to use I'd have to show you
some example code. Based on your current CGI experience (if any), you can
then judge how efficient and cost-effective it is to develop web applications
using Cold Fusion. Here's an example, that if saved in a single web page
(index.cfm) will count how many times each surfer has viewed that page.
Note that any &lt;cf...> tags will get interpretted by Cold Fusion and are
stripped out before the page gets returned to the surfer...

----->8---(Snip! Snip! Copy text after this line into index.cfm)--------

&lt;html>
&lt;head>&lt;title>Cold Fusion Example&lt;/title>&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
	&lt;cfset newCounter = 1>
	&lt;cfif isDefined("cookie.counter") is true>
		&lt;cfif isNumeric(cookie.counter) is true>
			&lt;cfset newCounter = cookie.counter + 1)
		&lt;cfelse>
			<!--- goodness! people will actually
			      hand-modify contents of cookies
			      just to see what happens! --->
			      
			&lt;cfset newCounter = 1>
		&lt;/cfif>
	&lt;/cfif>
	
	You have visited this page 
	&lt;cfoutput>#newCounter#&lt;/cfoutput> times!
	
	&lt;cfcookie name="counter" value="#newCounter# expires="NEVER">
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>

----->8---(Snip! End of text)-------------------------------------------

You might want to try this for yourself. You'll need to download and install a
web server on a computer, then download and install a demo version of Cold
Fusion Application Server from http://www.allaire.com/. Once everything has
been set up you can request your web page using a web browser and you should
get back the following HTML code when you view the page for the first time:

&lt;html>
&lt;head>&lt;title>Cold Fusion Example&lt;/title>&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
	
	
		
			
		
			
			      
			
		
	
	
	You have visited this page 
	1 times!
	
	
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>

Note that all the &lt;cf...> tags are removed, and the #newCounter# variable's
contents was inserted (the number 1 in this case). Note also the extra white
space left behind in the resulting document. This white space can also be
removed using some other &lt;cf...> tags that are built into Cold Fusion.

Now try to remember all the code you need to write to make simple queries to
your SQL databases using the other programming languages you're used to.
Well, by complete contrast, here's how Cold Fusion would do it (it's
insanely easy):

&lt;cfquery name="listPeople" datasource="mydatabase">
	SELECT * FROM PEOPLE
&lt;/cfquery>
&lt;cfoutput query="listPeople">
	#listPeople.firstname# #listPeople.lastname#&lt;br>
&lt;/cfoutput>

Of course there are many more attributes you could have used and you can
achieve any kind of complexity you like. You can even call stored procedures
in the database, or pass BLOBs and CLOBs (just ask the next Oracle guru
about that and he should be impressed).

/ Free Stuff? /
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Okay, so Cold Fusion Application Server is not free, but hey it's certainly
worth a lot more than they charge for it. However, if you still want to use
it and want it at the "right price" (free), then you can always make use of
Cold Fusion Express. Cold Fusion Express is a feature-limited version of
Cold Fusion Application Server. It will get you started without the need
for the cash outlay. Be sure to check out the feature comparision matrix
too (search Allaire.com), because you may find that Cold Fusion Express
is all you need.

/ I Can Make Some Money? /
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Oh yes! :) Cold Fusion programmers can often dictate their own employment
packages because it's a skill that's currently in great demand.
