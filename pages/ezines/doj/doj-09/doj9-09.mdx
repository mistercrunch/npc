'happy faces'

too many happy faces.
why isn't mine so chipper?
is it the monotony of everything?
the fact that my life is being xeroxed
the same thing every day.
like a struggling writer.
erasing his writing and blowing away the ashes
and starting over
just to write the same thing
an artist with a block.
walking down a hallway
of fluorescent lights
blinded by reality
never reaching a door.
like so many things
yet so.
uncommon.
too many fucking happy faces.
