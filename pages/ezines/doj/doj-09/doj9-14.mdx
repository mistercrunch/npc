Free Mumia Abu-Jamal 

=====================

This is a special Dr. Klep Speaks. I haven't written one of these in a while, so im taking it easy and staying on one subject. and It's about Mumia Abu-Jamal. Read up. He needs all the help he can get!





==============================



Mumia Abu-Jamal was a radio journalist in Philadelphia, known as "the

   voice of the voiceless" during the years of Mayor Frank Rizo. He was

   the recipient of a Major Armstrong Award for radio Journalism, and was  named one of Philadelphia's "people to watch" in 1981 by Philadelphia

   magazine. He was president of the Association of Black Journalists in

   Philadelphia, and he had no prior criminal record.



   Jamal was a member of the Black Panther Party, and later a supporter

   of the MOVE organization. He was a leading critic of police violence

   against the minority communities of Philadelphia, practices that led

   to an unprecedented suit filed by the United States Department of

   Justice seeking to end the notorious brutality of the Philadelphia

   police. The FBI and Philadelphia police amassed hundreds of pages of

   surveillance files on Jamal, beginning when he was 15 years old, for

   his outspoken opposition to racism and police brutality.



   In 1982 Jamal was convicted for the killing a white Philadelphia

   police officer, and was sentenced to death.



   For the last 17 years Jamal has been locked alone in a cell 23 hours a

   day, denied contact visits with his family. His confidential legal

   mail has been open and reproduced by prison authorities. He was put

   into punitive detention for writing his book, Live From Death Row, which is in its sixth printing by Addison-Wesley. Recently the U.S.

   3rd Circuit Court of appeals found this punishment to be

   unconstitutional and that prison officials had yielded to pressure

   from the Fraternal Order of Police. However journalists are still

   prohibited from filming or recording interviews with him. As Jamal has

   put it, "They don't just want my death, they want my silence." 





   Will he ever receive a fair trial?



   On October 29th, 1998, the Philadelphia Supreme Court rejected Mumia's

   appeal for a new trial. Recent court hearings had raised very serious

   questions about his trial and the evidence used against him. The

   appeal addressed 26 of these issues. In the PSC ruling on the appeal

   they found that every single defense witness was not credible,

   including all the witnesses who testified either that a different

   person was the shooter or that another man was seen running from the

   scene. The PSC also found that every single witness presented by the

   prosecution and the police was completely credible, including those  who changed their stories to implicate Mumia and who received favors

   from the police. However, the courts choice to deny a fair trial is

   not surprising. Considering the PSC is elected in partisan political

   elections, in which some of justices received the endorsement of the

   Fraternal Order of Police which has campaigned for Jamal's execution.

                                                                        



    Facts of the case.



   The Judge had sentenced more people to death than any other sitting

   judge in the United States. Six former Philadelphia prosecutors have

   sworn in court documents that no accused could receive a fair trial in

   the court of Judge Albert Sabo.



   The Defense Investigator quit the case before the trial began because

   the meager court allocated funds were exhausted. Neither a ballistics

   expert nor a pathologist were hired because of insufficient funds. 



 The Racial Bias of Philadelphia's courts now has 120 people on death

   row - all but thirteen of them non-white.



   The Jury was empanelled only after eleven qualified African-Americans

   were removed by peremptory challenges from the prosecution, a practice

   that was recently revealed as having been taught to prosecutors in a

   special training video tape.



   The Defense Attorney testified that he didn't interview a single

   witness in preparation for the 1982 trial and he informed the court in

   advance that he was not prepared. Jamal was also denied the right to

   act as his own attorney.



   The Prosecutor used the fact that 12 years earlier Jamal had been a

   member of the Black Panther Party as an argument for imposing the

   death penalty, a practice later condemned as unconstitutional by the

   U.S. Supreme Court in another case.                              



    The question of the "evidence":



   The prosecution claimed that Jamal loudly confessed at the hospital

   where he was taken after being shot by the slain officer and beaten by

   the police. But the jury never heard from police officer Gary Wakshul

   who was guarding Jamal at the hospital and reported "the Negro Male

   made no comments." When called as a defense witness, the prosecution

   contended that he was on vacation and unavailable. The judge refused a

   continuance so he could be brought in, when in fact he was home and

   available.



   Today we know that no police officers present claimed to have heard

   this "confession" until two months after it allegedly occurred, and

   after Jamal had filed police brutality charges. The attending

   physician also denies that Jamal said anything.



   The prosecution claimed that ballistics evidence proved that Jamal was

   the shooter. BUT THE JURY NEVER HEARD the written findings of the

   medical examiner which contradicted other prosecution testimony by  stating "shot w/ 44 cal" (Jamal's gun was .38 caliber). Jamal's court

   appointed attorney said he didn't see that portion of the report, so

   he never raised it. TODAY WE KNOW that the police never tested Jamal's

   gun to see if it had bee recently fired, never tested Jamal's hands to

   see if he had fired a gun, have never shown Jamal's gun to be the

   fatal weapon, and have lost a bullet fragment removed by the medical

   examiner.



   The prosecution claimed that eye-witnesses identified Jamal as the

   shooter. BUT THE JURY NEVER HEARD from a key eye-witnesses, William

   Singletary, who saw the whole incident and has testified that Jamal

   was not the shooter. Singletary, a local businessman, was intimidated

   by police when he reported this, and he subsequently fled the city.

   TODAY WE KNOW why the key eye-witnesses Veronica Jones, Cynthia White,

   and Robert Chobert testified as they did in 1982. Jones, who now

   testifies in support of Jamal, was threatened with the loss of her

   children if she did not support the police story. Chobert, a white cab

   driver, first told the arriving police that the shooter ran away.

   White backed the whole police story, but none of the other witnesses

   can remember seeing her at the immediate scene. Both Chobert and White  received very special treatment, including exemptions from criminal

   prosecutions. By contrast, when Veronica Jones testified in Jamal's

   support, she was arrested in the courtroom.       



      What's Next?



   Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge has long vowed to sign a new death

   warrant as soon as the state Supreme Court ruling was announced. We

   expect it to be signed soon. When it is signed the execution would

   occur with in the following 30 days.



   When this occurs we will be mobilizing. Demonstrations will occur in

   Philadelphia and other major cities the day after the death warrant is

   signed. The following Saturday will be a giant protest in

   Philadelphia.
