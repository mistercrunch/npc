  :Editorial: "The changing winds..."

  I have decided that since the demise of my fellow editor Rue-the-Day,
the DoJ needs some serious reconsiderment. Like whether to continue
the way we have started, or whether to continue at all. We always 
portrayed the DoJ as needing reader submissions to keep us going. And
we crafted the DoJ to cover more diverse and worthy articles. Total
nerd zines or total technical publications are fine but too specific,
not aimed at the masses. The DoJ opened its doors to everything even
subversive or underground. But we hoped that what readers submitted
would help shape the zine and give it a mroe defined direction so that
we would know where it was going. 

  And despite early interest and continued interest on IRC and news
groups, people are hugely reluctant to submit or even comment on past
issues. We can't go on sales, since its not for sale - we can't go on
passing comments in shop, since we don't have a shop - the only way
we can know if what we're doing is worthwhile is when you try and let
us know. An email - a submission. We even created an online art gallery
to let people who didn't feel comfortable writing to submit. But it all
failed...

  The staff are going to take a vote shortly after this issue goes out
as to continue or not. I doubt many read this section, but if you have
an opinion... voice it...
