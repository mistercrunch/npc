:DoJ History:
 cronus

  Rue approaches Cronus on one boring school day with an idea. A new
e-zine, not another clone hacking/phreaking e-zine but an underground
zine covering all sorts of underground topics. To begin with Cronus
went around looking for similar zines but despite the piles of virus
zines and anarchy rantings, nothing was similar to what we intended.

  So Cronus went to work on a nice site, and when it came to picking
a name for the zine we discovered Rue already had an idea. He had
toyed with the idea of a hacking group called the Discordant Opposition
and simply because it meant nothing we accepted it. The Discordant
Opposition Journal was born. 

  We went looking for some help and Digital Avatar and Kleptic who
we both knew from hacking channels on Dalnet were quick to volunteer
as staff members. Ethercat was a friend of both Cronus and Rue and
Rue's domain was hosted on her server. So she was gave us space for
the first DoJ site. 

  We went through many readers, few writers and the staff list changed
on an issue basis. We allways aimed to make the Journal more of a 
collaberate work between the staff and the readers. But most of the,
even devoted, readers seemed reluctant to submit. The Editors knew that
the Journal always attracted a large reader base because of site visit
logs and also reader e-mails. Cronus and Rue both made heart-felt
requests for readers submission, but interest seemed non-existant.

  Recently Rue's domain expired and low on funds as unable to maintain
the domain so inclusively the DoJ website went down. Since Cronus was
the designer of the site, he didn't feel it necessary to even check
on the DoJ site so when it went down it toke days before any staff
member realised. Cronus was told by Relm [the latest addition to the
staff list] and promptly tried to find a new home for the DoJ site.

  Sinnocence was an more a friend of a friend and when she heard of
the Editors hosting problem offered to handle the DoJ site on her 
domain. So not only did the Journal have several mirror sites but
we had gone through two domains. One of our main mirror sites was
the Packet Storm Security archieve. Due to the insecurities of a
certain JP from AntiOnLine.com the PSS archieve was taken offline. But
Attrition and Project Gamma both continued to be loyal supporters.

  Major thanks go out to Ethercat and Sinnocence for thier offer.
Digital Avatar, Kleptic and Relm are thanked you for thier efforts.
DrSo|oman, mad_boar, RedVixen, Strykar, EarthShaman, fraggle and 
Infinity Matrix was all thanked deeply for writing. Also despite the 
fact that we decided to drop the online art gallery we would like to 
thank all who submitted art. The decision was taken to drop the 
gallery because of an extreme lack of interest. 

  That is a conclusion of the Discordant Opposition up to this point,
I'm not sure if anyone reads the Editorial but all the DoJ staff ask
that if you read and enjoy the Journal to submit or our effort will
go unrewarded.
