:Ways to stay hidden from People Finding Websites:
 Kleptic (kleptic@grex.org)

Heres a few steps you can take to protect your private information. 
If you dont want to find your name and home address slashed across 
the world wide web... try one or more of the following techniques:

-> Get an unlisted phone number. This prevents the bulk of people-
tracking web sites from finding your name, address, and phone number 
in a telephone directory.

-> Use a fake name. The phone company doesnt care what name you use, 
just as long as you pay your phone bills on time. A fake name will 
throw off the majority of some of these so called 'people tracking 
websites'. even if someone knows your actual phone number.

-> Contact the people-finding website directly and request that your 
name be removed from their listing. Unfortuately, with so many people 
finding websites popping all over the place, this might mean 
contacting a dozen different websites and then theres still no 
guarantee that a new people finding website won't turn up with your 
informaton anyway.

<*>If you dont want to make your email address available to anyone 
who might be searching for it, try one of more of the following 
techniques:

-> Use an ananymous remailer before posting any messages to a Usenet
newsgroup. This method also helps keep your email address off mailing
lists used by spammers.

-> Change email addresses frequently. If receiving email isnt that
important to you, use multiple email accounts and shut them down
periodically.


<*> If you really need to hide, avoid leaving a paper trail of any 
sort. Don't sign up for telephone service (or, if you must, use a 
fake name); avoid using credit cards; pay cash for everything; avoid 
magazine subscriptions that use your real name. Eliminating your 
paper trail can be a lot of work, but it might be worth it if you 
are hiding from someone dangerous (like the Internal Revenue 
Service).


Keep It Real!
