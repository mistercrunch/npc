:The Art Of Pirated Software:
 A Non-Toxic How-To Guide
 Written By Relm 

===============================================
Disclaimer:
Pirating software is illegal and should not be
done. All software downloaded or copied should be
destroyed within 24 hours or you may face criminal
charges. Myself Relm will not be held responsible
for any criminal or damage charges you may get from
reading this text. This text should be used for
informational purposes only.
===============================================

Pirating software is one of the crimes most committed
world wide and has costed companies billions and billions
of dollars, But of course they didn't loose that money
they just never gained it. You can goto almost any public
search engine now a days and type in warez and get a
list of over a thousand websites that carry pirated
software or otherwise known as warez. This mass
availability of pirated software is so outrages that
you can talk to almost anyone on irc and they can
offer some type of product that they didn't pay for
and downloaded freely of the Internet and onto there
personal computer without anyone ever knowing about
it. Pirated software is spread threw the Internet
so much now a days that most people don't even know
that it is pirated software, They might just think
it's a program that anyone can download freely with
no obligation but most of the time there wrong.
Now Im not against pirated software since I myself use
many commercial programs that I cracked or have downloaded
since Im not going to pay for something If I can get
it free in a matter of a few minutes, Any normal person
who values there money wouldn't pay for a candy bar
if there's a machine right in front of them that gives
them for free, This is just common sense if it's
illegal or not. Pirating software is not something
that's hard to do or takes any talent at all but
it does require a little smarts to not get caught
in the long run or while your in the action.

Now I was pirating software before I even got into
the hacking scene, I actually got into the hacking
scene threw pirating software but that's another
story. I have used any and all decent software and
games that have been released and have had the full
version without paying a nickel, Yes, I know this might
seem a little un-ethical and I know the programmers
etc. have to feed there families and make a income but
Im sure there doing just fine so I don't really worry
about that. My biggest concern around myself pirating
software is my ethical beliefs because some of it does
go against some of my personal ethics and that's
why today I only use pirated software that I need to
keep my computer in correct operating procedures
such as anti-virus software, firewalls and anything
else I need to keep my computer in tip top shape.

Now there are a few ground rules around pirating software
and I hope to outline some below.

No.01 Rule: Never share or tell anyone that you possess
pirated software unless there a good friend or you trust
them with your freedom.

No.02 Rule: Never upload to a bbs, website or an ftp unless
you get a kick out of being busted.

No.03 Rule: Don't download from ftp's or bbs's unless you
can trust them and you know that it's not a setup, No joke,
I have heard of people who have been busted by falling
for this. Just make sure you get ride of the software within
24 hours and they can't do shit.

No.04 Rule: Don't be stupid, Use your head and know what
the hell you are doing.

Well that's a few basic rules that you should go by when
your into the pirating software deal. Im serious guys, You
might think that using pirated software is no big deal but
will just wait and see if your ideas change once you have
criminal charges and have to pay some big ass fine or even
spend a little time with big bertha and I'm sure your not
to into that kinda thing..well...there are a few weirdos
out there.

Well now let's get into some fun stuff. Im going to tell you
how to download pirated software from warez sites and I mean
that I'll show you how to tell a good site from a bunk one
and if it's even worth to go threw all those pop up adds and
I'll explain some other things so just keep reading.

Finding Warez:
( Warez = Pirated software or stolen software ). Now finding
warez is not a hard thing to do at all and I don't really even
know why Im going to tell you I guess it's just to fill up a
little space. To find warez try to goto an underground search
engine such as astlavista or you can try public search engines
such as webcrawler ( www.webcrawler.com ) or hotbot ( www.hotbot.com)
and search for the following keywords, Warez, Pirated Software,
Gamez, Appz or any other underground slang term for various categorys
of products. Now before you click onto a url in the search engine
look at the link at the bottom of the description, If it has something
like www.warezplanet.com/wares/appz/gamez.html it's ok and you may
click the link but if it is something that resembles this www.sexplanet.net/pussy/link.html
then don't click it because it's just a porn site trying to get you to
click there link. Many porn sites out there submit thousands of fake
links to there page just to get people to stumble upon there page.

Should I Try The Maze?:
Almost all warez sites have a million banners and porn adds and top 50
links on there page, Many of the links will be like " Click Here For Games "
but really it's just a link to one of the top 50, 20 etc. pages so don't
even bother, If it's the first page on the site meaning that you just
clicked on the link in the search and it brought you
to this page then scroll down all the way to the bottom
of the warez page and there should be a little link such
as "[Enter Here]" and this is most likely the true real
link to the main page, Sites do this link faking shit
to get more hits to there pages and also make profit.
Now what if you click this link but it took you to xxxporn.com
or some other porn site then just forget about it is most
likely some fool just making money off of banner clicks
so just try another page.

Downloading, Spotting The Fakes:
Well now that you have found a site and made it in to
the download page listen to what I have to say, Now say
your looking for quake 2, Now you see quake 2 on the gamez
page and it looks like this " Quake 2!! File 1, File 2, File 3 ect."
now this is most likely a bogus link because most games are contained
in one large zip with the file 1, file 2 etc. in the zip, Now there
are a few games that are like this out there and are real but it's
not common. Also once you find a link to Quake 2 it will most likely
be dead since so many ftp's offering games go down and up
daily so it's a hard thing to keep up with. Also say your downloading
Turok 2 and the file is only 50k forget it, It's not the game it's probably
a virus or just some stupid joke file so don't even bother with it.
Lots's of the time pages will say they have the full version
of Starcraft but it's just the demo and this happens often, Many, Many
sites say they have full version games when the truth is they are all demos.
You might even come across a commercial game and it's a home made remake
and isn't the real deal, Yeah, I have seen it, Some people will program
a game that looks almost like the real deal but isn't the real shit,
This happened with me once with Final Fantasy 7 but it didn't fool
me and my friend because we are both major FF fans and know
the games from up and down.

Hiding Your Pirated Software:
Now I know that there are a few teens out there that use
there daddy's computer or maybe your just someone who
doesn't want anyone to find out that you have pirated
software on your PC. There are a few ways to hide software
and here is a few, Rename the folder to something technical
such as VB345Files and place it in a windows directory where
no one will look or you can use a program such as magic
folders and make it disappear also you can change the folder 
and or files to hidden. You can also encrypt your
software so people can't access it and find out what it is.
Most people aren't that worried about hiding there software
but I thought I might as well just lay out a few suggestions
anyway.

Who To Tell And Who Not To:
Now this is a big thing if your going to be a serious
pirater, If you tell your friends and they go blabber to
there friends that they know this guy who has blah, blah
such a prog and they go wow and tell someone else they might
tell some goody goody who might turn you in so only tell your
good friends and tell them not to tell anyone because I have
almost gotten in big shit from telling a guy that I had some
wicked new prog that I pirated so it's just a dumb thing to do
so don't do it! ;)

Uploading To Friendly FTP's:
Now if your going to upload Im sure you know the person who runs
the ftp and you trust him. Now don't just upload anything, First maybe
upload something little that wouldn't cause any fuss then once your
sure you can trust this ftp then upload maybe some good stuff, Ohya,
Only upload to an ftp if they already have a bunch of popular commercial
software on there ftp, You don't want to upload to an ftp if the only
thing they have on there is Doom because it might be a setup or something
and it's not worth the hassle.

Pirating Your Own Software:
There are many ways to pirate your own software and I'll just
tell you how to do a few.

Games To Roms (Pirating Another Type Of Software):
Yes, some roms are pirated software and are classified as so.
To create a rom and put it on your computer you will
need something that's called a Burner, A burner will copy
the game portion off the CD or Cartridge and then you can
transfer it to another CD, Cartridge or your computer.
I have a friend who burns Playstation games for people for
10 bucks, He can get me any game I want for just 10 bucks.
What my friend does is he rents a game for like a buck fifty
then burns it with his burner then just returns the game and
collects his money from the person purchasing the game from
him.

Software And Cracks:
Once you have a demo of a program you can make a crack on your
own which is a little harder but not that complicated or you
can browse a crackz site and pick one up on your own. Most
software has serial numbers that it uses to identify if someone
purchased the software or if it's still in demo mode, You can go
to a serialz site and look up the software you want the serial for
and then just put the serial number in the software and like magic
you have a full, registered version of that software. You can goto
to a game renting store that rents computer games and pick up a copy
of Unreal for like a buck fifty then bring it home install the game
then go search for a game cracks page for a crack for Unreal, Run the crack
then there you go, you now no longer need the cd to play unreal and you
can return the cd and still have the game. If you can't find a crack
for Unreal or any kind of software then make a crack on your own and then
distribute it to a few crack sites but to make a crack it takes a little
talent in a few fields. A lot of software can be registered with a few simple
touches of the registry in windows and you can do this by using the windows
registry tool "regedit". Editing the registry is a little more hard to
do and you have to have a clear understanding of how the registry works,
Maybe I'll make a text one day explaining how to hack the registry.

How do I remove copyright protection from a CD?:
Well to do this there are a few tools I have heard of, I have never
done this since I have never needed to but just try searching for a tool
that does this sort of thing and you should be fine. I forget the name
of the tools that can do this but Im sure with a little looking you
can find something on your own..hell that's the fun it ;)

Well that's all I can really think of right now to include in this text
so on that note I think I'll let you go so until next time keep it cool.
