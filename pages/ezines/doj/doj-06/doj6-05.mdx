:The OSI Model:
 Strykar

The OSI model breaks the various aspects of a computer network into
seven
distinct layers.The model itself is not a networking standard in the
ways
Ethernet & Token ring are.It is more of a framework into which the
various
networking standards can fit.The OSI model specifies what aspects of a
networks operation can be addressed by various network standards.So in a
way you can call the OSI model a standards standard.

In all the seven layers described below the bottom two are the one's
that have a practical impact on smaller networks.Networking standards
like Ethernet & Token Ring are Layer-1 & Layer-2 standards.The higher
layers of the OSI model do not have widespread standards.


Layer1:The Physical Layer
The bottom layer of the OSI model is the physical layer.It addresses the
physical characteristics of the network i.e. the types of cables to be
used to connect devices,types of connectors used,how long the cables can
be etc.
The physical layer does not define any meaning to those signals other
than the basic binary values 0 & 1.It is upto the higher levels of the
OSI models to asign meanings to the bits that are transmitted at the
physical layer.

Layer2:The Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer is that layer at which meaning is assingned to the
bits that are transmitted over the network.A standard for the data link
layer must address things such as size of each packet of data so that
each packet is delivered to the intended recipent & a way to ensure that
two or more nodes dont try to transmit data at the same time.It also
provides basic error detection & correction to ensure that the data sent
is the same as the data recieved.If an uncorrectable error occurs the
Data Link Standard specifies how the node is to be informed of the error
so that it can retransmit the data.

Layer3:The Network Layer
The Network Layer addresses the interconnection of networks by routing
packets from one network to another.This is an important layer when
you're using a router to link two different types of networks,say an
ethernet & a Token Ring network.This is possible because the Network
Layer is one step above the Data Link Layer & it does'nt matter whether
two networks use different standards at the data link & physical layers.

Layer4:The Transport Layer
The Trasnsport Layer is the basic layer at which one network computer
communicates with another network computer.The Transport Layer
identifies each node on the computer with a unique address & manages
connections between nodes.It breaks large messages into smaller ones &
reassembles them at the recieving node.The Transport Layer & the OSI
layers are implemented differently by various network operating
systems.The OSI model can run NetWare,LANtastic,Windows for
Workgroups,or just about any other network operating system on a
standard Ethernet network as Ethernet addresses the lower layers of the
OSI model.

Layer4(a):The Lemon-Pudding Layer           *wink*
The Lemon-Pudding Layer is squeezed in between the rather dry &
tasteless transport & session layers to add flavour & moisture.

Layer5:The Session Layer
The Session Layer establishes sessions between network nodes.A session
must be established before data can be transmitted over a network.The
Session Layer ensures that these sessions are properly established &
maintained.

Layer6:The Presentation Layer
The Presentation Layer is responsible for converting the data sent over
the network from one type of representation to another.It can apply
complex compression techniques so that fewer bytes of data are required
to represent the information when it is sent over the network,once the
data is recieved at the right node the Presentation Layer uncompresses
it.It can also scramble data sent over the network using sophisticated
encryption teechniques.

Layer7:The Application Layer
The Application Layer is the highest layer of the OSI model,the
Application Layer deals with the techniques that application programs
use to communicate with the network.Application programs like Lotus
1-2-3 & WordPerfect are not part of the application layer.It is the
network operating system itself that works within the application layer.
