===================================================================
Hi there. Every time it comes around that time where I need to start
thinking about what Im going to write for the next DoJ I get this kind
of funny feeling in my belly, It's a kind of butterfly feeling and Im
thinking "What am I going to write that's original and people
won't think that it's lame?". Usually I think up all the crazy ideas
that are pretty lame but funny but I can never seem to think of a good,
solid thing to write. Well here I am again taking another wing at this 
so lets start.

First off Im sure many people have came to a webpage and have seen the
link "login" or "Members" to either a normal site or porn. Now personally
I don't care what the site is I just like getting the password, once
I crack a password I get a big rush from it and that's what I go for.
Now many people will probably tell you to try to find an exploit for the
server or something like that and that's all good if your serious, If your
doing it just for fun while your bored you can do it this way. Now Im
going to assume you all understand .pwd (Password) files and have a general
knowledge of how they are used. Well the files I'll be talking about
are .pwd and .htpasswd file formats. Now many sites have there .pwd open
for access to the public, They don't really mean to do this but it happens.
Now first off you will need to find a .pwd or .htpasswd file, To do this
you would goto a search engine (I recommend go800.com) and search for
"vti_pvt" . Once you search for this you should get a list of sites that
look like this:
---------
1. Index of /_vti_pvt
Index of /_vti_pvt. Name Last modified Size Description. Parent directory. _x_todo.htm

Now once you goto these sites you should get a directory list of a bunch of .log 
.cnf, .htm and other types of files. Most of these are useless, you will just have to
try a bunch of different sites until you find one that has .log or .htpasswd files
in it. Ok I just took a break and browsed for vti_pvt and in a matter of about a minute
I found a password file (.pwd), That just shows you how easy it is. Now I'll paste the
directory at http://kiosco.net/_vti_pvt/ to just show you how it will look when your searching
around here and what
you should look for:


 Parent Directory       29-Jul-98 19:26      -  
 access.cnf             29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 botinfs.cnf            29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 bots.cnf               29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 deptodoc.btr           29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 doctodep.btr           29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 frontpg.lck            29-Jul-98 19:20     0k  
 linkinfo.cnf           29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 service.cnf            29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 service.grp            29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 service.pwd            29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 services.cnf           29-Jul-98 19:26     0k  
 services.org           29-Jul-98 19:26     1k  
 svcacl.cnf             29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  
 writeto.cnf            29-Jul-98 19:21     1k  

Ok so you see a directory listing of the files, You can just skim threw these and scan for the
files your looking for, As you can see in this directory there's a "service.pwd" file and this is
what we are looking for. btw, If you find a .pwd file it might be shadowed, you will need to get a
script to unshadow the file. Now if take a look at a .htpasswd file in your browser you'll get
something like
this (Actual example):

This file has a lot of user and passwords in it so you should be able to get something out of this.
Now in the state it is it's not usable, Which you want to do it save the file to disk. Now here
I'll talk about what tools you need to crack this file. Im directing this example at windows users
by the way so I'll explain some good tools that you should use in windows. Now first you
will need a cracker, I recommend the DOS version of John The Ripper, you can get the latest
version at the official John The Ripper webpage ( http://www.false.com/security/john/ ) or
you can grab it from my site at ( http://www.fallenangelz.net ). If you use *nix then I recommend
http://www.undergroundnews.com/ for some crackers. You can use John The Ripper in
console but all you lazy people who like GUI's might want to get VCU to run John The Ripper
visually, You can download Velocity Cracking Utilities from http://www.wilter.com/wf/vcu/ or
http://www.fallenangelz.net . VCU is a nice set of utilities and is very helpful in what you
are doing. Now VCU is fairly self explanatory, If your using John version 1.0 then pick "Run
John The Ripper 1.0 Visually" or if you have 1.6 choose the 1.6 in VCU, Once your in the run
John Visually part of VCU you will have to set the path to the file you want to crack, the path
to john.com and also the word list you will be using, You can grab a few word lists from
http://www.theargon.com/ You'll want to get one that's all lower case and one that's Upper and
Lower case, It's best to have one that's at least 20 or so megs. To crack the file it could take a few
hours to a few days so it's
really only something you do when your bored ;) . Well I hope that taught a few people out there,
I know that this is pretty simple but I had no clue to what to write so I just did it. peace
