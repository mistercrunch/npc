From the desk of the koala:

I took over the publishing of DoJ simply because I did not want to see it die.  I will not claim to be the replacement for cronus or rue, but I shall claim to be their successors....That being said.  This issue will be lighter than the others, simply from the fact that I was not prepared to take the reigns of the journal....I ask everyone's forgiveness and everyone's tolerence as I come to speed with publishing an online-zine that I feel has something worthwhile in the endless demi-reality that is cyberspace....

We have come a long way in the diffusion of knowledge to the malcontent and to those who feel slighted in the random mix of birthrights and percieved achievements.  In no way do I personally or professionally support upheaval of established governments.  But throughout history, those in power have used igonorance as a means to subjugate and enslave those without the power or the knowledge to shake the shackles...Power comes from knowledge and knowledge come from people....

"To each their own and to the owned comes each".......This is the cry of the slave in hope for Justice......In our world, we are subtle slaves, slaves to things we cannot see, touch or feel...Long gone are the days of whips and manacles, but we are equally restrained....We have traded the taskmaster for the paymaster, we give our lives to the coin of the Realm and we give all for that coin.  Throw off the coin and you thow off the chain....Although I may not be the first to follow that axiom, I think it may be true....I strive for it....

Enough of this, I ramble....More shall come, and more shall be learned....
