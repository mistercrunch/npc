Hippocrit - By -=HadeS=-

Have you ever just sat down and wonder how hipporcitical a person can
be?  I have, and this is what i came up with.  Everyone is a hipprocrit.
Take me for example. I have come up with a list of this I hate and love.  

-Hate rats. Love acid.
-Hate old girlfriends. Love dating their friends.
-Hate the mail system. Love it when i get letters.
-Hate it when teachers are mad at you cuz you know more than they do 
about the subject they are teaching.  Love the fact that I know more 
than my teachers.
-Hate gym class. Love sports.
-Hate haveing people fear you. Love the respect that comes with it.
-Hate people that think they are too good for me. Love the feeling 
that I will be better than them. 
-Hate my life. Wouldn't trade it with anyone.
-I hate bible betters. Love smoking them up :)
-I hate hipprocrits. And yet, I love myself.

I don't know, maybe it's just a bad acid trip but i think I'm right. 
Aren't we all hipprocrits? FUCK IT.  Who really cares anyway? Well i 
said my bit for the night. Keep it reall everyone.

School sucks - By sin|cal

There is a new program in school now. it's called "I own your 
little bitch ass tille the day you graduate.101".   Now i didn't 
relize this till of course I was  out of school, but we all take it.  
Well I'm sick of this shit we kids put up with.  Think of how much 
controll teachers have over your life.  The way i look at it is that 
we are all catorgrized at the begining of it all.  Ryan is a good 
student and he'll make far in life, while Mat is such a bad boy.  
Look at the cloths he wears and the crowed he hangs around with.  
Well of course Ryan gets his free ride through school, while Mat has 
to work his little ass off to get the grades he gets cheated from 
anway. I say fuck them. I have worked my little ass off for them for 
the last time.  They want to treat me like a kid I say fine. I'll act 
like one. You want to own my ass till i graduate fine.  I'll let you 
own me for the 12 years I'm here.  But remember, I'm young and still 
learning. I'll remember your mistakes when you forget them.  I'll 
remember what you made me go through just to pass.  But now that I 
have passed my final test and am out of the controlled school years.  
It's my turn to own your bitchy little ass. I'm in the grown up world 
now and payback's a bitch.

Making Me Sick - By InfinityMatrix

The underground scene is starting to make me sick. I don't really know why, but it just is.
Maybe you heard that DigitalAvatar retired, well he did. I was good friends with DA from the 
start. He helped me and I helped him. We were good friends to the end. DA was in the scene
for a few years, and suddenly, one day, out of the blue, he says "I'm Quitting the scene."
Naturally, I say, "What?" He says, "I'm quitting the scene man. Everything is so dull... so...
boring." I was in a state of shock for a few moments, mulling over what he said. So I say
"Why has it gotten boring?" "It just has. And it's starting to get dumb."

I thought about this for a good hour, staring at my wall, pondering over this thought. I thought
about it some more, and then finally came to a conclusion. I agreed with him. The underground
scene has become a bit monotonous. A bust here, A defacement there. Groups/individuals starting
fights on the Attrition Mirror. It has me thinking... Should I quit? When will this scene last
till? And on and on.

But quitting is just what DA did. He just decided to do it one day... and for good reason. He
said the scene has gotten boring. Well... don't you believe him? Nothing is happening! The scene
is slowly dissolving from what it used to be! There were hardly any kiddies in the BBS days,
as my good friend EarthShaman knows. Shaman was into the underground scene deeply. He knew what
it was like. So did DA, he knew the new scene. And he just thought it went poof. Which in some
people's eyes, it did. 

In my eyes... well, I think it's still alive and kicking for the time being. I'm gonna stay in it
as long as I can. If you have an opinion other than this, comments, hate-mail, whatever, send 
them to infinitymatrix@cyber-optic.com or infinitymatrix@phreak2000.com feel free to email me.
