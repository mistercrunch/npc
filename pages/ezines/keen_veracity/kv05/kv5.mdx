Things are picking up as far as the whole Legions Interactive arrangement is concerned. 
  We are lately working with the Meta Fantasies corporation on a large programming
  project This means due to all the work I'll be retiring my status as 
  chief editor of Keen Veracity. So from now on feel free to email all your
  questions comments or article submissions to digi@wintermute.linux.tc
  Keen Veracity will still be around but DigiEbola will be taking my place as the editor. 
  Rest assured each issue will still be chock-full of articles regarding computer 
  related data.    As I established in the first part of the zine.  "Hacking is not about 
  exploiting the system its about knowing the system."  A lot
  of people out there login to their consoles, and get on irc and start
  talking about what they are going to "own" next.  Hacking isn't "owning"
  the "net" (no one entity "owns" the net) its about building the net.  
  Why inflict distress on a system created by hackers?  Take advantage of 
  what computers, and the network has to offer.  Instead of sitting there 
  compiling exploits figure how the exploits works, and how it is connected with
  the system, and how you can go about fixing it.  But most of all figure out how the system 
  works because once you do you've compiled the  greatest exploit known to man.  Use
  the system to your preference, and to the advantage of everyone else by circumventing the 
  system and sharing what you've learned with everyone else because the truth remains that
  not everyone knows all there is to know.  And the more information you share with others 
  the closer we become to being a even more knowledgeable brotherhood  That's all for now.

  Do you still hack?

[responce]

 Well it depends on your analogue of hacking. By the authentic
  formalization I "hack" everyday.  Whether I'm coding, or doing
  Network checks it's still hacking.  Hacking has little to do
  with the "illegal" entry of computer systems apart from the
  Technical, and systematic aspect of it.  Illegally accessing a system     
  for no intended reason is not something I advocate or 
  advise performing.  What I suggest achieving is going out, and   
  learning, and questioning the system itself before trying to exploit it.  
  And even once you feel you have a broad knowledge of the system make sure
  you use what you know to build things, and not fuck things up.
  System admins who are affected by crackers turn to hackers in
  order to secure their systems. They turn to the philosophies,
  documents, and programs written by "hackers"...  Let's not
  make them look the other way.  We are here, and we are skilled.
  What your brain dead system administrator can do in a week we can
  accomplish in a matter of minutes more practically.  That's the message

  Hi Optik,

  [question]
 I was wondering if you could answer a question or two.  This lady 
 came into the newsroom yesterday with a printout of a strang icon she
 found on her AOL instant messenger screen.  Apparently it was put there
 by some kind of virus or trojan horse attached to a FateX program that
 her son downloaded.  I understand from what little I could find on this that  
 this is a "punter" program. What, exactly is a punter program?  She says this
 thing totally screwed up her computer, including her DVD drive and she had to trash
 it and get a new one. Also, when this happened someone masqueraded as one of the
 people on her "buddy list" and she chatted with them for hours before finding out
 it wasn't who she thought it was.  

 [responce]

 FaxeX is an AOL Denial of service program based on AOHell, which was the
 pioneer for AOL programs of its kind.  This program embodies "attack" 
 options such as "phishers", "punters", "scrollers", and other options 
 that really only cause minor damage.  These programs are created by 
 teens whose coding experience in most cases do  not go beyond visual
 basic.  The programs that these juveniles create are made in poor taste,
 and the interfaces are so poorly put together it is obvious the authors 
 lack any significant programming knowledge.  For the most part
 The authors create these programs for publicity. (Don't know if that's
 much coming from the AOL community.) At any rate it isn't very hard to
 please the gimpy uses of the AOL citizenry  (most of them anyhow) that
 is the largest concern AOL or anyone using it should have.  These programs 
 are downloaded by the thousands generally utilized by users who cant very 
 well operate their computer system let alone be given access to a application
 of harassment (at which very little computer science is needed to operate).
  A worse case scenario would be someone using a "phisher" to obtain a user
 password.  Even then it would take someone extremely dense to fall for it. 
 A phisher is basically an instant message sent out to multiple users giving
 them a bull shit line such as "Hi, I work with AOL our server is being updated
 please message back with your Login and password.  Failure to comply will result
 in having to re-register" A message like that if indeed from AOL will never
 be sent directly to the user using something as open as an IM (Instant Message),
 but most likely via email. Now as for punters these are tools that pose no real
 threat except for the fact that they are really annoying.  All they do is send 
 you a massive amount of messages till you are forced to log off, and restart 
 your AOL session (ergo the term punt).  I seriously doubt the program FateX 
 itself was to blame for the system mishap.  Maybe it was in an indirect manner,
 but a virus downloaded by her son would be a more illusive reason.  Because
 AOL is a harbor for lamers, and the sort most of the programs sent out or 
 downloaded in relation to AOL are most likely to be infected with some sort 
 of virus.  MY suggestion would be to download a virus scanner, such as Nortan
 Anti Virus 4.0 by Symantec or McAfee anti virus software.

take care,

  \ Tcp Wrappers         \-&lt;lothos>
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An Introduction to TCP Wrappers
lothos    lothos@thepentagon.com


        The TCP Wrappers program, from Wietse Venema, is an easy to use
utility for host and network based access control that does logging for
services started by inetd(8).  TCP Wrappers will allow you to finger
people who connect to you, display a banner for incoming telnet
connections, or run an ambiguous command, and will also prevent some
spoofing attacks by making sure the IP address and hostname match.

_Getting TCP Wrappers_

        TCP Wrappers is shipped with many flavors of unix, including
BSD/OS, OpenBSD, and possibly other *BSD flavors.  It comes standard with
Linux, but is rarely configured correctly.
        You can get tcp_wrappers from
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/security/tcp_wrappers_7.6.tar.gz, or from
ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/tcp_wrappers.  Version 7.6 is
the latest as of this writing.

_Installing TCP Wrappers_

        The advanced way to install tcp_wrappers, as instructed in the
readme, is actually easier, so I will describe that way to install.  

1. Copy the current /etc/inetd.conf to another location as a back up, such
as /etc/inetd.conf.dist.

2. Edit tcpwrapper's Makefile to show where the real daemon's are located.
Under OpenBSD I would uncomment REAL_DAEMON_DIR=/usr/libexec.

3. If you want the language extension enabled, uncomment the following
line:

   #STYLE  = -DPROCESS_OPTIONS     # Enable language extensions.

  I recommend uncommenting this line, which makes access control easier by
allowing you to specify access control in one file, instead of two, and
also allows you to use the extra features, including banners and commands.

4. Next, compile tcpwrappers.  If you simply type 'make' it will output an
error message.  You must specify the system type you have, as specified by
the error message.

_Configuring /etc/inetd.conf_

        You must edit your inetd.conf file in order to use tcpwrappers.
Change it to specify the location of tcpd.

telnet          stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/telnetd telnetd

should be changed to:

telnet          stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/tcpd telnetd

or the location of your tcpd daemon.  A 'kill -HUP inetd' will update
these changes.

_Access Control_

        Access is controlled by two files, /etc/hosts.allow and
/etc/hosts.deny.  If you followed my instructions above, you will only
need the /etc/hosts.allow file.

        The format of this file is:

    daemons : client_host_list : option : option


        A simple example to demonstrate this:

    fingerd : local.machine.com : ALLOW

NOTE:  You should use ip addresses for increased security.

        TCP Wrappers should log to MAIL.INFO by default, but this can be changed
in the Makefile.  I have also set up my /etc/syslog.conf file so that the logs
go to both a file and to /dev/ttyC7 so I can read them in real time.

_Advanced Options_

Banners

        Banners display a message to someone connecting to your machine.  You
need to set up a directory for them, I have mine set up in /etc/Banners.
Using banners, you can have separate banners for allowed hosts and denied
hosts by using two directories (/etc/Banners/allowed/, for example)

An example of a banner:

Trying 192.168.0.0...
Connected to 192.168.0.0.
Escape character is '^]'.

WARNING:

This computer system is for authorized users only.  Any unauthorized
access will be logged and prosecuted.

You have been logged as: root@phear.com

OpenBSD/i386 (phear) (ttyp5)

login: 


        You can make your banners as simple or complex as you'd like.  %c will
return username@hostname info, assuming the other computer has identd
running.  Some expansions that can be used are:

Token   Mnemonic        Expands to:

%a      address         ip address of client.
%c      client info     username@hostname
%s      server info     daemon@host.

There are many more options, these are the ones I use the most frequently.

A denied host will display:

Trying 192.168.0.0...
Connected to 192.168.0.0.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.

        You can also optionally specify a banner to display for deny as well by
specifying a banner to use, to provide more information to the user about
why the access is denied.

        If you want to allow fingerd from local hosts, and want external hosts
to be denied with a message, you would configure /etc/hosts.allow like so:

fingerd : LOCAL : allow
fingerd : all : twist /path/to/message

The twist option will run a specified shell command.

        You can also specify that tcpd finger anyone attempting to connect to
your machine.  We do not finger any finger connections, to prevent a
continuous loop where the remote machine also fingers connections.

all EXCEPT fingerd : bad.com : (/usr/local/bin/safe_finger -l @%h | \
        /bin/mailx -s %d-%h security@phear.com) &

        You can split a command over two or more lines by using the backslash
character.  safe_finger is used because it filters out any nasty control
characters.  This command will mail the results of finger @bad.com to the
user of your choice.

_Checking Access Control Settings_

        Besides coming with safe_finger, tcpwrappers also comes with two
utilities that check your access control.  From tcpdchk(8): tcpdchk examines
your tcp wrapper configuration and reports all potential and real problems
it can find.
        tcpdmatch will find a match in the access tables and tell you if
it's allowed or denied, as well as displaying any banners you may have.
This is a great way to see if your access files are thorough enough.

_Limitations of tcpwrappers_

        TCP Wrappers is vulnerable to IP spoofing because it uses IP addresses
for host authentication.  It will only provide authentication for daemons
started by inetd(8), and only provides limited support for UDP services.
There is a patch that allows tcpwrappers to be used with sendmail 8.8.8,
but IMHO the wrapper that comes with TIS Firewall Tool Kit is much better.
www.tis.com for more info.

_Sources and More Info_

        Read the man pages for more info:  tcpd(8), tcpdchk(8),
tcpdmatch(8), hosts_access(5), and hosts_options(5).  There is also
information about tcpwrappers in Practical Unix and Internet Security by
Simson Garfinkel and Gene Spafford.

Securing / Auditing Novell

First Simple Rule Upgrade to NetWare 4.x this will defeat many of the attacks
NetWare provides no audit trail
Your site's security policy should include a process for Administrator approval of user
ID creation. Security Administration procedures, which your site security policy should 
govern and of which you keep a manual, record should include the following:

* Reactivating disabled Ids
* Reactivating forgotten passwords
* Removing access when a user is terminated or has changed job functions
* Monitoring changes to access privileges and entitlements the supervisor assigns 
  to users to ensure that changes are appropriate for the user
* Periodic review of user access privileges and entitlements to ensure that access
  level are still appropriate

Starting to check your installation security

Many Hacker attacks exploit common-sense failings of the system, you should be sure that 
you secure your NetWare network. NetWare security program provides information on how the
 supervisor installed security on the system. You can also use the security program to 
perform a compliance review. Only the supervisor and users with Supervisor equivalent Ids
 can run the security program.

Physically secure the server
* You should at a minimum control access to the server room with key access, preferably
  by some type of electronic key card access with track.
* If the server has a door with a lock on the server itself lock the door and limit 
  access to the key. Secure the keyboard within a cabinet or other locked area to prevent
  command entry directly into the operating system.
* If you only load NLMs from SYS:SYSTEM directory, use the SECURE CONSOLE command to 
  prevent loading NLMs from the floppy or other location.
Secure important files off-line and protecting scripts
* You should always secure your most important files off-line and off-site.
  You most important files refer to startup.ncf, autoexec.ncf, the NetWare bindary or the NDS.
* You should copy all the system log-in scripts, container scripts, and all the user or other
  log-in scripts off-line. NetWare stores the log-in scripts in the SYS:_NETWARE  directory 
  a hacker can edit these files using edit.nlm. File with extensions such .000. these files
  are probably log-in scripts.
* You should compile a list of network-loadable modules and their version numbers, and
 a list of files from the SYS:LOGIN, SYS:PUBLIC, and SYS:SYSTEM directories, you should
 periodically check your file list against the originals stored on the computers themselves
 to ensure that no one has altered any of the files
* You should create a written list of all users and groups on your network, use syscon or 
another network tool to create a written list of users, groups, access levels, check the 
list against a report from Novell security program., check for ODD accounts with Supervisor
 access such as GUEST or PRINTER
Monitor the Console/Administrator
* Just as you should physically secure the console, you should ensure that the network
 logs all activities users perform on the console. To log console entire use the conlog.nlm
 program the log will be recorded in SYS:ETC\console.log. When you check the console you 
should also press the UP-ARROW key befor you begin to enter your commands at the console.
 Doing so will show what commands the last user entered at the console.
* Run the securefx.nlm module after the security breach and you get this message : Security
 breach against station &lt;connection number> DETECTED. The securefx.nlm will writes its error message to an error log.
* You should avoid using the Supervisor account for any except the most critical of access
 activities. If you have not enabled packet signatures someone could use a program that 
spoofs user packets and gain access to the server as Supervisor.

Use Packet signature 

* The NetWare login protocol consists of three packet exchanges between the server 
 and the client. First the client sends a request for a login key, the server generates
 a random eight byte value and sends it to the client. Then the client sends a request
 for for the user ID of the user loging in, the server looks up the user ID in the
 bindery and sends it to the client.
 Finally, the client computes X=hash(UID,password) and Y=hash(X,login key) andsends 
 the result to the server. The server retrieves X'=hash(UID,password) stored in the 
 bindery and computes Y'=hash(X',login key). If Y=Y', the client is granted access as 
 the user. If both the client and server agree to use packet signatures, both parties
 then compute Z=hash(X,c) (where c is some constant value) which they will use as a
 shared secret for authentication.
The following chart gives a graphical representation of the protocol:
Client Server
Request Login Key ------------------------------------------------>
<------------------------------------------------ Login Key
Request User ID ------------------------------------------------>
<------------------------------------------------ UID of client
Compute X=hash(UID,password) Compute X'=hash(UID,password) Compute Y=hash(X,login key) 
Compute Y'=hash(X,login key)
Request Authentication ------------------------------------------------> If
Y=Y', Access is Granted
Comput Z=hash(X,c) Compute Z=hash(X,c)
When a user Alice logs in, an attacker Bob can interrupt this protocol sequence and gain
 access as Alice without knowing her password. In order for the procedure to work, Bob must
 be on a network where he can observe the traffic between Alice and the server, and Bob must
 be able to respond to
Alice's requests faster than the server.
First Bob sends a request to the server to login, and the server sends Bob a login key R". 
Then Alice requests a login key from the server, Bob sees the request and spoofs a reply as
 the server which sends Alice R" as her login key. The server receives Alice's request and 
sends her R as her login key,
when Alice receives R she will discard it as a duplicate. Alice requests her UID from the 
server, and the server responds with her UID. Alice computes X=hash(UID,password) and
 Y=hash(X,R") and sends the result to the server. The server computes Y'=hash(X,R), since
 Y' is not equal to Y, Alice is denied
access. Meanwhile, Bob saw Alice's Y submitted to the server, he retrieves this value from 
the network and sends it to the server for authentication as Alice. The server computes 
Y"=hash(X,R"), sice Y = Y" Bob is granted access as Alice. Bob requests not to sign packets,
 if the server does not require all clients to sign packets, then Bob is allowed to masqurade
 as Alice.
Alice Bob Server
Requests Login Key R" ---->
<---- Sends R" to Bob
Requests Login Key R ----------------------------------->
<---- Sends R" to Alice
<----------------------------------- Sends R to Alice
Receives R" first
Discards R as a duplicate
Requests UID for Alice ----------------------------------->
<----------------------------------- Sends UID of Alice
Computes X=hash(UID,password)
Computes Y=hash(X,R")
Sends Y to the server -----------------------------------> Computes
Y'=hash(X,R)
Sees Y and retrieves it. Y != Y',
access is denied
Sends Y for ---> Computes
authentication Y"=hash(X,R")
Y"=Y, access is
granted
Refuses to sign packets If all clients are
not REQUIRED to
sign packets,
access is granted.
There may be a second attacker, Joe, waiting for Alice to log in without using packet 
signatures. As a result, Joe can highjack Bob's connection as Alice.
To defend against this attack, set the NCP PACKET SIGNATURE LEVEL option to 3 in the server's 
AUTOEXEC.NCF file. Setting this option to 3 at the client will have no effect, the option MUST
 be set at the server.
The Netware default for packet signatures is 2 at the server and client. If the hacker wants 
to use a hacking tool which forges packets, the hacker can try to set the worksation signature
 level to 0 (no packets required) within the computer client net.cfg. If the server is set to
 1 or 0 the hacker will log in right to the network and defeat the entier purpose of the packet
 signatures.

Rconsole
* The rconsole utility lets the Supervisor monitor the network at the server-level remotly. 
To log into rconsole the Supervisor must enter an rconsole password, a hacker using a sniffer
 can sniffer the password and crack it. 
* Do not try to use the switch /P=password switch to limit the rconsole password to just the
 Supervisor password, if you use "LOAD REMOTE /P="Supervisor password you will get into 
rconsole but the rconsole password is now "/P".
* Worse of the hacker gains access to your autoexec.ncf file the rconsole pawword is visible
 in plain text.
* Check the name and location of rconsole, rconsole.exe is located in the SYS:SYSTEM directory
 by default in 3.11, in 3,12, 4.1 rconsole is in  SYS:SYSTEM and SYS:PUBLIC. You should limit
 access to the file only by the Administrator.
Move all Netware configuration files to secure location
* By default Netware places all Netware configuration files (ncf) within the SYS:SYSTEM
 directory. Because most hackers know this, their first goal to access the SYSTEM directory 
and modify the ncf files. Your best defense against hackers attacking your configuration files
 is to move the files to a more secure location
* Put your autoexec.ncf in the same location as your sever.exe file. If a hacker 
compromises the access to the SYS:SYSTEM directory, you will at least have protected 
the autoexec.ncf file.
* A simple trick you can do is to keep a false autoexec.ncf file in the SYS:SYSTEM with a 
false rconsole password.

Remove PUBLIC from ROOT in 4.1's NDS
* Unlike 3.1, 4.1 includes a single trustee which essentially grants everyone read 
access to every directory on the system. To prevent all users from seeing the entire 
directory tree remove the PUBLIC Trustee from the ROOT object's Trustee list.

Default system accounts
* When you install Netware the installation creates two or four default accounts 
:Supervisor and the guest in netware 3.x and Supervisor guest admin and user_template 
in netware 4.x. When the network creates the default accounts none of the default
account has password. For example many installation will use a printer account or 
LASERPRINTER account with no passowrd on them.

Hacking and defending passwords
* In Netware 2.x 3.x the bindery file's attributes are hidden and system and both
 located on the SYS:SYSTEM subditectory, in 4.x they are located in SYS:_NETWARE
* 2.x   net$bind.sys, net#bval.sys this file conatin the paswords
* 3.x   net$boj.sys, net$prop.sys, net$val.sys this file conatin the paswords
* 4.x   value.nds       part of the NDS
block.nds       part of the NDS
entry.nds       part of the NDS
partitio.nds    type of NDS partition (replica master, etc)
mls.000                 License
vallincen.dat   Licence validation
If  the intrusion detection system IDS is disabled the hacker can use a brute force 
to crack the password..
* Set the unencrypted option by entering the following line at the console or adding 
it to autoexec.ncf SET ALLOW UNENCRYPTED PASSWORD=ON &lt;Enter>
* The best protection against dictionary attacks is to force users to regularly change 
their passwords.
* Periodically run security or another system analysis program for a somaple passwords check,
 and instruct the users to use eight-letter minimum passowrds which include numerals, symbols
 and letters.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have all seen them, heard about them, and most people use them. What am I
talking about? None other than the Cellular Phone. One of the most interesting
things ever that is associated with the Phreaking Community. This guide will
not tell you how to do illegal things with your cell but this will give you a
basic view of how the cellular phone works. Enjoy!
_____________________________________________________________________________
" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " 

1) Some of the Cellular Phone Basics

        The main thing to remember about a cellular phone is that it is a 
radio. It is basically like a hand held walkie talkie except with a cellular
phone you have alot more capabilities and can talk and listen at the same 
time. Remember though that when you are talking on a cellular phone what you
say may and possibly will be monitored very easily. There are two main types
of Cellular Phones Analog and Digital. 

        1) Analog: On this the audio is modulated directly onto a carrier
        2) Digital: On Digital, these are converted to digitized samples. 
                    These are transmitted as 1's and 0's. Then it is converted
                    back to voltage so you get the audio signal.

        Each Cellular Phone has to identify itself to its cell site before
service is allowed. They are identified by what is known as an ESN and a MIN.

        1) ESN: This stands for Electronic Serial Number. This is a 32-bit
                Binary Number if I am not mistaken. 
        2) MIN: Mobile Identification Number. This is the phone number of the
                Cellular Phone. 10 digits including area code and all.
_____________________________________________________________________________
" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " 

2) The Reason for the name Cellular.

        The reason for this is that in each city the Cellular Phone System is
divided into smaller sections also referred to as cells. These usually have an
antenna on top of a high surface that gives out strong signals therefore giving
you clear service. 
_____________________________________________________________________________
" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " 

3) Review of the Cellular System.

        The main system operating in the United States is the AMPS, Advanced
Mobile Phone System. The AMPS are composed of two different things:

        1) EAMPS: This system has 832 channels.
        2) NAMPS: This system has three times the amount with very clear
                  signals.

        All these have 42 channels that are used to setup calls the rest are
for talking over the Cellular Phone.

4) What goes on during Cellular Calling.

        Just imagine if you are stranded somewhere or possibly just want to
use your cellular phone to call someone. Have you ever wondered how it worked?
Why it worked? If so then I will explain how and why in this section here.
Enjoy!

        1) Scan Channels: In this step the cellular phone scans for the 
                          closest cell site near you so that you can get
                          the strongest signals possible due to your location
                          at the moment. 

        2) Choose Strongest: As stated above the cellular phone finds the
                             closest site to give you the best performance.

        3) Send Message: The phone sends a short message to the cell site 
                         verifying the MIN, ESN, and the number that you
                         have just entered to call.

        4) Assign Channel: After verifying the above information and they
                           know that you are a legal paying customer, the
                           base assigns a mesage to your phone, telling it
                           where the conversation is.

        5) Talk: Phone then gets on that channel and begins to ring. Then
                 you begin to talk like normal. The easiest step of them all.

5) Cellular Cloning and Other Features.

        Cellular Cloning is one of the newest and more popular things going
on now a days. What you are basically doing is programming someone else's 
MIN and ESN into your phone in the process of fooling your cellsite into 
thinking that you are actually them. Is this legal? Well it depends on which
way you use it. If you use it to clone one of your own phones where you can
have two phones exactly the same then no, but if you are cloning someone 
else's then yes it is very illegal. The philosophy of a cellular phone phreak
as stated in another text written by John Markoff is to push the machines as
far as they would go. The possibilites with a cellular phone are practically
endless. You can make one into a scanner as well as many other things. 
        
        The first step of being able to do ANY of this is getting the cellular
phone into what people call test mode. This is where you can practically change
the whole phone's features. The main way to get into this is to crack the access
code. There is a good site that deals with that at the following URL: 
http://www.radiophone.com They have great information. Another way to get a 
cellular phone is by taking the battery pack off of the back and look in the
lower corner. Here you will see some little prongs, you can get a small piece
of tin foil and place it in the center of the prong like so: |*|
then put the battery pack back on the back of the phone. Then turn the phone
on and when you turn it on you should see an array of flashing numbers. If
so you are in luck because you are in test mode! :)~

6) Basic Test Mode Programming

        This section will tell you what to do once you get into the test mode.
This part comes from 1993 Cellular Subscriber Technical Training Manual. I 
give full credit to them for this information. I am not going to include all
of it because it would take forever. Here are some of the basics. Enjoy!

        32# = clear the phone
        38# = displays the ESN
        55# = test mode programming
        01# = restart
        13# = power off
        16# = setup
        18# = send NAM
        34# = turn DTMF off
        61# ESN transfer
        
        That is jsut some of the very basics. Of course there is alot more
and if I ever write another article with Cellular Phones I will include some
more. Don't want to get very much ahead of ourselves. :)

7) What kind of Cellular is Best?

        There are different kinds of cellular phones for different kind of
people. Me personally I have experience so far with only Motorola. I plan to
get a Nokia soon. Nokia are very advanced and have many options. There is also
the OKI those have been stated to be good. The one that interests me at the
moment are these new ones that are Java based. If you would like to read more
about these go to the following URL: 

http://www.nortel.com/cool/norteledge/edge298/N._IP_N.html

        But as stated above many people like many different things, there is
also a new Motorla that is the IDEN I10000. These have two-way radio and 
alphanumeric pager in one. These weigh in at around 5 oz. as well. 
They also include: One touch call back, a speakerphone, and a multilanguage
operation that displays prompts in one to four different languages. For more
information on this you can call: 1.800.453.0920

8) Where is the Cellular Technology Going?

        This is a very interesting thing to think about including all the 
things that they already have out and available at this point in time. There
is no way to actually predict what is going to come out next due to people
having new ideas with each and every passing day. It should be an interesting
thing to think forward about. Whatever it is, it will turn heads I am sure!

9) Closing

        We have seemed to read the end of this guide. I hope this has been
an informative source and you enjoyed it. I will probably write another cellular
guide in the future but am not sure at the moment. Remember "Push the Machine
as Far as it will Go!" =)

  \ USB- Where it's going\-&lt;Digi Ebola>
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


In the struggle for better peripheal technology, there can always be improvementThese days, 
speed is a issue as well as easy usability. The USB or 
Universal Serial Bus is a product of this struggle. With USB, you can connect 
a virtual plethora of devices, such as cameras, scanners, and drives. You can 
even go as far as running a network off USB. This new technology is the wave of
the future in more ways then one. In this article, I will outline advantages 
of the Universal Serial Bus as well as uses that go beyond the standard fare.

==========
Advantages
==========

USB is fast. Much faster then the standard serial port. 12 megabit per second speed.
 Also, in addition to the speed, you can have 120+ devices on one USB port Most of the
 devices are hot-swapable, allowing them to initialize without a reboot of the system. 
The USB has excellant versitility, with its digital connection, allowing you to 
uses speakers, telephones, and attach to networks.

=======
Uses 
=======

Now while the many kinds of devices are being developed for USB, the world seemsslow 
on implementing it. Imagine a house, that is ran by computer. This is the 
founding technology that will connect it. You could design a entire security  
system based on USB and have it all controlled thru a terminal. With standard 
parts availiable out of electronic catalogs, you can construct your security  
system, using laser diodes, electronic locks, thumbprint id, and cameras. With 
the speed USB offers, there is no way better to integrate everything. With a 
maximum of 127 devices, it is suited to almost anysize house. If ran on a linux terminal,
you could even connect remotely to enable or disable any device in thesystem. Now, most 
people do not bother with hi-tech security in the homes, but you could even extend the 
system to home appliances, lights and windows. Think you left your oven on? Telnet in 
and shut it off. With the internet, and       
personal communication merging, you could even use a cgi interface to control 
your home from the web, as well as down load images of the kids sleeping while 
you are away, or checking to make sure the dog is still alive.

=================================
The Future of USB, and Hacking It
=================================
With the integration of USB is complete, do not be surprised if the things such
as standard telephones, tvs, and radios utilize it. Entire computer systems 
can be built off the technology. With this in mind, for the average person on 
the go, the laptop will serve not only as it does now, a portable office, but as a
 full fledged media tool and personal communicator. This will open so many
avenues for the people of the digital age. One scenario is, you go over to a   
a friends, and wish to exchange files. You set your laptop on the table, and   
whip out a cable, and plug it into the Intranet via wall socket. Instantly, 
the system assimulates you like you were meant to be there. You now have access
to the entire system, including the phone, and media services. 

This technology will bring many avenues to explore as well as secure. If phones 
are implemented, it will take phreaking to a whole new level. Entire houses will be 
comprimised, as well as the security systems mentioned above. The job of the 
security consultant or the cracker will get more interesting. While all this
sounds corny, society wants convienence, and with that brings security holes 
and even flaws. I urge anyone with the skills to start developing USB periphealsand 
if your like me, a security system. Integrate your house, your car and even
your dog with USB.

  \ Long Distance Carriers\-&lt;Levine>
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



Here's another table from the FCC's BBS listing all of the operating IXC's
in the country with the states where they operate.  There's a big matrix of
which states each carrier operates in, not reproduced here.

I was surprised to find that the only carriers that operate in all 50
states (actually 49 states and D.C., since Alaska is special, until
very recently a monopoly jointly operated by Alascom and AT&T) are
the big three, AT&T, MCI, and Sprint.  C&W, LDDS, and Wiltel operate
in 49 states, all but Alaska.  Allnet operates in 48, all but Alaska
and Arkansas.  (I have no idea what their problem is in Arkansas.)
There are two that operate in 45 states, and the rest are down in the
30s or below.

The state with the fewest carriers listed is Delaware, with 6.  I
expect that's a wart of geography -- all of Delaware is in the
Philadelphia LATA, so Delaware customers can be served from a POP in
Pennsylvania.

 Everybody has one, but what makes it work?
 
     Although telephones and telephone company practices may vary 
dramatically  from one locality to another, the basic  principles 
underlying the way they work remain unchanged.

     Every  telephone consists of three  separate  subassemblies, 
each capable of independent operation.  These assemblies are  the 
speech  network, the dialing mechanism, and the ringer  or  bell.  
Together, these parts - as well as any additional devices such as 
modems,  dialers,  and answering machines - are attached  to  the 
phone line.


The phone line

     A  telephone is usually connected to the telephone  exchange 
by  about three miles (4.83 km) of a twisted pair of No.22  (AWG) 
or  0.5  mm  copper wires, known by your phone  company  as  "the 
loop".   Although  copper  is  a good  conductor,  it  does  have 
resistance.   The resistance of No.22 AWG wire is 16.46 Ohms  per 
thousand  feet  at 77 degrees F (25 degrees C).   In  the  United 
States,  wire resistance is measured in Ohms per  thousand  feet; 
telephone  companies describe loop length in kilofeet  (thousands 
of  feet).   In  other parts of the  world,  wire  resistance  is 
usually expressed as Ohms per kilometer.
 
     Because  telephone apparatus is generally considered  to  be 
current   driven,  all  phone  measurements  refer   to   current 
consumption, not voltage.  The length of the wire connecting  the 
subscriber to the telephone exchange affects the total amount  of 
current   that  can  be  drawn  by  anything  attached   at   the 
subscriber's end of the line.

     In  the  United States, the voltage applied to the  line  to 
drive  the telephone is 48 VDC; some countries use 50 VDC.   Note 
that telephones are peculiar in that the signal line is also  the 
power  supply line.  The voltage is supplied by lead acid  cells, 
thus  assuring a hum-free supply and complete  independence  from 
the electric company, which may be especially useful during power 
outages.

     At  the telephone exchange the DC voltage and  audio  signal 
are  separated  by  directing  the  audio  signal  through  2  uF 
capacitors and blocking the audio from the power supply with a 5-
Henry choke in each line.  Usually these two chokes are the  coil 
windings  of  a  relay  that switches  your  phone  line  at  the 
exchange;  in the United States, this relay is known as  the  "A" 
relay (see fig.1).  The resistance of each of these chokes is 200 
Ohms.

     We can find out how well a phone line is operating by  using 
Ohm's  law  and  an  ammeter. The DC  resistance  of  any  device 
attached  to the phone line is often quoted in telephone  company 
specifications  as  200  Ohms; this will vary  in  practice  from 
between  150 to 1,000 Ohms. You can measure the DC resistance  of 
your  phone  with an Ohmmeter. Note this is  DC  resistance,  not 
impedance.


     Using  these figures you can estimate the  distance  between 
your telephone and the telephone exchange.  In the United States, 
the telephone company guarantees you no lower current than 20  mA 
-  or  what is known to your phone company as a  "long  loop."  A 
"short loop" will draw 50 to 70 mA, and an average loop, about 35 
mA.  Some countries will consider their maximum loop as low as 12 
mA.  In practice, United States telephones are usually capable of 
working  at  currents  as  low as 14  mA.   Some  exchanges  will 
consider your phone in use and feed dial tone down the line  with 
currents  as  low as 8 mA, even though the telephone may  not  be 
able to operate.

     Although  the telephone company has supplied plenty of  nice 
clean  DC  direct  to your home, don't assume  you  have  a  free 
battery  for your own circuits.  The telephone company wants  the 
DC resistance of your line to be about 10 megOhms when there's no 
apparatus  in use ("on hook," in telephone company  jargon);  you 
can  draw no more than 5 microamperes while the phone is in  that 
state.   When  the phone is in use, or "off hook," you  can  draw 
current, but you will need that current to power your phone,  any 
current you might draw for other purposes would tend to lower the 
signal level.

     The  phone  line has an impedance  composed  of  distributed 
resistance, capacitance, and inductance.  The impedance will vary 
according  to the length of the loop, the type of  insulation  of 
the wire, and whether the wire is aerial cable, buried cable,  or 
bare  parallel wires strung on telephone poles.  For  calculation 
and specification purposes, the impedance is normally assumed  to 
be 600 to 900 Ohms.  If the instrument attached to the phone line 
should  be of the wrong impedance, you would get a  mismatch,  or 
what  telephone  company  personnel refer to  as  "return  loss."  
(Radio  Amateurs will recognize return loss as SWR.)  A  mismatch 
on telephone lines results in echo and whistling, which the phone 
company  calls "singing" and owners of very cheap telephones  may 
have  come  to expect.  A mismatched device can, by the  way,  be 
matched  to  the phone line by placing resistors in  parallel  or 
series  with  the line to bring the impedance of  the  device  to 
within the desired limits.  This will cause some signal loss,  of 
course, but will make the device usable.

     A  phone  line  is balanced feed,  with  each  side  equally 
balanced  to ground.  Any imbalance will introduce hum and  noise 
to the phone line and increase susceptibility to RFI.

     The  balance  of the phone line is known to  your  telephone 
company  as "longitudinal balance."  If both impedance match  and 
balance  to ground are kept in mind, any device attached  to  the 
phone  line  will perform well, just as the correct  matching  of 
transmission  lines and devices will ensure good  performance  in 
radio practice.

     If  you  live  in the United States,  the  two  phone  wires 
connected  to your telephone should be red and green.  (In  other 
parts  of the world they may be different colors.)  The red  wire 
is  negative  and  the green wire is  positive.   Your  telephone 
company  calls the green wire "Tip" and the red wire "Ring".  (In 
other parts of the world, these wires may be called "A" and "B".)  
Most installations have another pair of wires, yellow and  black.  
These wires can be used for many different purposes, if they  are 
used  at all.  Some party lines use the yellow wire as a  ground; 
sometimes  there's  6.8 VAC on this pair to light  the  dials  of 
Princess type phones.  If you have two separate phone lines  (not 
extensions) in your home, you will find the yellow and black pair 
carrying  a second telephone line.  In this case, black is  "Tip" 
and yellow is "Ring."

     The  above description applies to a standard line with a  DC 
connection  between  your  end  of the  line  and  the  telephone 
exchange.  Most phone lines in the world are of this type,  known 
as  a "metallic line."  In a metallic line, there may or may  not 
be  inductance devices placed in the line to alter the  frequency 
response  of  the line; the devices used to do  this  are  called 
"loading  coils."  (Note: if they impair the  operation  of  your 
modem,  your telephone company can remove them.)  Other types  of 
lines  are party lines, which may be metallic lines  but  require 
special   telephones   to   allow  the   telephone   company   to 
differentiate  between  subscribers.  Very long  lines  may  have 
amplifiers,  sometimes  called "loop extenders"  on  them.   Some 
telephone  companies  use a system called  "subscriber  carrier," 
which is basically an RF system in which your telephone signal is 
heterodyned  up  to around 100 Khz and then  sent  along  another 
subscriber's "twisted pair."

     If  you have  questions about your telephone line,  you  can 
call your telephone company; depending on the company and who you 
can reach, you may be able to obtain a wealth of information.


The Speech Network

     The speech network - also known as the "hybrid" or the  "two 
wire/four  wire network" - takes the incoming signal and feeds it 
to the earpiece and takes the microphone output and feeds it down 
the line.  The standard network used all over the world is an  LC 
device  with a carbon microphone; some newer phones use  discrete 
transistors or ICs.

     One  of  the advantages of an LC network is that it  has  no 
semiconductors,   is  not  voltage  sensitive,  and   will   work 
continuously  as  the voltage across the line is  reduced.   Many 
transistorized phones stop working as the voltage approaches 3 to 
4 Volts.

     When  a  telephone is taken off the hook, the  line  voltage 
drops  from 48 Volts to between 9 and 3 Volts, depending  on  the 
length  of the loop.  If another telephone in parallel  is  taken 
off the hook, the current consumption of the line will remain the 
same and the voltage across the terminals of both telephones will 
drop.  Bell Telephone specifications state that three  telephones 
should  work in parallel on a 20 mA loop;  transistorized  phones 
tend  not to pass this test, although some manufacturers use  ICs 
that will pass.  Although some European telephone companies claim 
that phones working in parallel is "technically impossible,"  and 
discourage  attempts  to make them work that way, some  of  their 
telephones will work in parallel.

     While  low levels of audio may be difficult to hear,  overly 
loud  audio  can  be  painful.   Consequently,  a  well  designed 
telephone  will  automatically adjust its  transmit  and  receive 
levels  to allow for the attenuation - or lack of it - caused  by 
the  length  of  the  loop.   This  adjustment  is  called  "loop 
compensation."   In  the United States,  telephone  manufacturers 
achieve  this  compensation with silicon carbide  varistors  that 
consume  any  excess  current from a short  loop  (see  fig.  2).  
Although   some   telephones  using  ICs   have   built-in   loop 
compensation,  many  do  not; the latter have  been  designed  to 
provide  adequate  volume on the average loop, which  means  that 
they provide low volume on long loops, and are too loud on  short 
loops.   Various  countries  have  different  specifications  for 
transmit  and receive levels; some European countries  require  a 
higher transmit level than is standard in the United States so  a 
domestically-manufactured telephone may suffer from low  transmit 
level if used on European lines without modification.

     Because  a telephone is a duplex device,  both  transmitting 
and receiving on the same pair of wires, the speech network  must 
ensure  that not too much of the caller's voice is fed back  into 
his  or  her  receiver.  This  function,  called  "sidetone,"  is 
achieved  by phasing the signal so that some cancellation  occurs 
in  the speech network before the signal is fed to the  receiver.  
Callers  faced  with no sidetone at all will consider  the  phone 
"dead."   Too little sidetone will convince callers that  they're 
not  being heard and cause them to shout, "I can hear  you.   Can 
you  hear ME?"  Too much sidetone causes callers to  lower  their 
voices and not be heard well at the other end of the line.

     A  telephone on a short loop with no loop compensation  will 
appear  to have too much sidetone, and callers will  lower  their 
voices.   In this case, the percentage of sidetone is  the  same, 
but  as the overall level is higher the sidetone level will  also 
be higher. 


The Dial

     There  are two types of dials in use around the world.   The 
most common one is called pulse, loop disconnect, or rotary;  the 
oldest form of dialing, it's been with us since the 1920's.   The 
other  dialing  method,  more  modern and  much  loved  by  Radio 
Amateurs  is called Touch-tone, Dual Tone Multi-Frequency  (DTMF) 
or  Multi-Frequency (MF) in Europe. In the U.S. MF  means  single 
tones used for system control.

     Pulse  dialing is traditionally accomplished with  a  rotary 
dial,  which is a speed governed wheel with a cam that opens  and 
closes a switch in series with your phone and the line.  It works 
by  actually  disconnecting  or "hanging  up"  the  telephone  at 
specific intervals.  The United States standard is one disconnect 
per   digit,   so  if  you   dial  a  "1,"  your   telephone   is 
"disconnected" once.   Dial a seven and you'll be  "disconnected" 
seven times; dial a zero, and you'll "hang up " ten times.   Some 
countries  invert the system so "1" causes ten "disconnects"  and 
0,  one disconnect.  Some add a digit so that dialing a  5  would 
cause six disconnects and 0, eleven disconnects.  There are  even 
some  systems in which dialing 0 results in one  disconnect,  and 
all  other digits are plus one, making a 5 cause six  disconnects 
and 9, ten disconnects.

     Although  most exchanges are quite happy with rates of 6  to 
15  Pulses Per Second (PPS), the phone company accepted  standard 
is  8  to  10 PPS.  Some modern digital exchanges,  free  of  the 
mechanical  inertia problems of older systems, will accept a  PPS 
rate as high as 20. 

     Besides  the PPS rate, the dialing pulses have a  make/break 
ratio,  usually  described as a percentage, but  sometimes  as  a 
straight  ratio.  The North American standard is  60/40  percent; 
most of Europe accepts a standard of 63/37 percent.  This is  the 
pulse measured at the telephone, not at the exchange, where  it's 
somewhat  different, having traveled through the phone line  with 
its  distributed  resistance, capacitance,  and  inductance.   In 
practice,  the  make/break  ratio does not  seem  to  affect  the 
performance of the dial when attached to a normal loop.  Bear  in 
mind that each pulse is a switch connect and disconnect across  a 
complex  impedance, so the switching transient often reaches  300 
Volts.   Try  not  to  have your fingers  across  the  line  when 
dialing.

     Most pulse dialing phones produced today use a CMOS IC and a 
keyboard.  Instead of pushing your finger round in circles,  then 
removing  your finger and waiting for the dial to  return  before 
dialing the next digit, you punch the button as fast as you want.  
The  IC stores the number and pulses it out at the  correct  rate 
with the correct make/break ratio and the switching is done  with 
a high-voltage switching transistor.  Because the IC has  already 
stored the dialed number in order to pulse it out at the  correct 
rate,  it's a simple matter for telephone designers to  keep  the 
memory  "alive"  and allow the telephone to  store,  recall,  and 
redial the Last Number Dialed (LND).  This feature enables you to 
redial by picking up the handset and pushing just one button.

Because pulse dialing entails rapid connection and  disconnection 
of  the phone line, you can "dial" a telephone that has lost  its 
dial,  by  hitting  the hook-switch rapidly.   It  requires  some 
practice to do this with consistent success, but it can be  done.  
A  more sophisticated approach is to place a Morse key in  series 
with  the  line, wire it as normally closed and send  strings  of 
dots corresponding to the digits you wish to dial.

     Touch  tone,  the most modern form of dialing, is  fast  and 
less  prone to error than pulse dialing.  Compared to pulse,  its 
major  advantage is that its audio band signals can  travel  down 
phone  lines further than pulse, which can travel only as far  as 
your  local  exchange.   Touch-tone can  therefore  send  signals 
around  the  world via the telephone lines, and can  be  used  to 
control phone answering machines and computers.  Pulse dialing is 
to  touch-tone as FSK or AFSK RTTY is to Switched  Carrier  RTTY, 
where mark and space are sent by the presence or absence of DC or 
unmodulated  RF carrier.  Most Radio Amateurs are  familiar  with 
DTMF for controlling repeaters and for accessing remote and  auto 
phone patches.

     Bell  Labs developed DTMF in order to have a dialing  system 
that  could travel across microwave links and work  rapidly  with 
computer  controlled exchanges.  Each transmitted digit  consists 
of two separate audio tones that are mixed together (see  fig.3).  
The  four  vertical columns on the keypad are known as  the  high 
group and the four horizontal rows as the low group; the digit  8 
is  composed  of 1336 Hz and 852 Hz.  The level of each  tone  is 
within  3  dB  of the other, (the telephone  company  calls  this 
"Twist").  A complete touch-tone pad has 16 digits, as opposed to 
ten on a pulse dial.  Besides the numerals 0 to 9, a DTMF  "dial" 
has *, #, A, B, C, and D.  Although the letters are not  normally 
found  on consumer telephones, the IC in the phone is capable  of 
generating them.

     The  * sign is usually called "star" or "asterisk."   The  # 
sign,  often referred to as the "pound sign." is actually  called 
an  octothorpe.  Although many phone users have never used  these 
digits  -  they are not, after all, ordinarily  used  in  dialing 
phone  numbers  -  they  are used  for  control  purposes,  phone 
answering machines, bringing up remote bases, electronic banking, 
and repeater control.  The one use of the octothorpe that may  be 
familiar occurs in dialing international calls from phones in the 
United  States.  After dialing the complete number,  dialing  the 
octothorpe  lets the exchange know you've finished  dialing.   It 
can now begin routing your call; without the octothorpe, it would 
wait and "time out" before switching your call.

     When DTMF dials first came out they had complicated cams and 
switches   for  selecting  the  digits  and  used  a   transistor 
oscillator  with  an  LC tuning network to  generate  the  tones.  
Modern  dials use a matrix switch and a CMOS IC that  synthesizes 
the  tones  from  a  3.57MHz  (TV  color  burst)  crystal.   This 
oscillator  runs  only  during dialing, so  it  doesn't  normally 
produce QRM.

     Standard DTMF dials will produce a tone as long as a key  is 
depressed.   No  matter  how long you press,  the  tone  will  be 
decoded as the appropriate digit.  The shortest duration in which 
a  digit can be sent and decoded is about 100 milliseconds  (ms).  
It's  pretty  difficult  to dial by hand at  such  a  speed,  but 
automatic dialers can do it.  A twelve-digit long distance number 
can  be  dialed by an automatic dialer in a little  more  than  a 
second - about as long as it takes a pulse dial to send a  single 
0 digit.

     The output level of DTMF tones from your telephone should be 
between  0 and -12 dBm.  In telephones, 0 dB is 1  miliwatt  over 
600  Ohms.   So 0 dB is 0.775 Volts.  Because your  telephone  is 
considered  a 600 Ohm load, placing a voltmeter across  the  line 
will enable you to measure the level of your tones. 


The Ringer

     Simply  speaking  this  is a device that alerts  you  to  an 
incoming  call.  It may be a bell, light, or warbling tone.   The 
telephone company sends a ringing signal which is an AC waveform.  
Although the common frequency used in the United States is 20 HZ, 
it can be any frequency between 15 and 68 Hz.  Most of the  world 
uses  frequencies  between  20 and 40 Hz.   The  voltage  at  the 
subscribers  end depends upon loop length and number  of  ringers 
attached to the line; it could be between 40 and 150 Volts.  Note 
that  ringing voltage can be hazardous; when you're working on  a 
phone line, be sure at least one telephone on the line is off the 
hook  (in  use); if any are not, take high  voltage  precautions.  
The  telephone  company may or may not remove the 48  VDC  during 
ringing;  as  far  as you're concerned, this  is  not  important.  
Don't take chances. 

     The  ringing  cadence  - the timing of ringing  to  pause  - 
varies from company to company.  In the United States the cadence 
is  normally  2  seconds of ringing to 4 seconds  of  pause.   An 
unanswered phone in the United States will keep ringing until the 
caller  hangs up.  But in some countries, the ringing will  "time 
out" if the call is not answered.

     The  most  common  ringing  device is  the  gong  ringer,  a 
solenoid  coil  with a clapper that strikes either  a  single  or 
double bell.  A gong ringer is the loudest signaling device  that 
is solely phone-line powered.

     Modern  telephones tend to use warbling ringers,  which  are 
usually  ICs powered by the rectified ringing signal.  The  audio 
transducer  is either a piezoceramic disk or a small  loudspeaker 
via a transformer.

     Ringers  are  isolated from the DC of the phone  line  by  a 
capacitor.   Gong  ringers  in the United States use  a  0.47  uF 
capacitor.  Warbling ringers in the United States generally use a 
1.0  uF  capacitor.  Telephone companies in other  parts  of  the 
world  use  capacitors  between  0.2  and  2.0  uF.   The   paper 
capacitors of the past have been replaced almost exclusively with 
capacitors  made of Mylar film.  Their voltage rating  is  always 
250 Volts.

     The  capacitor  and  ringer coil, or Zeners  in  a  warbling 
ringer,  constitute a resonant circuit.  When your phone is  hung 
up ("on hook") the ringer is across the line; if you have  turned 
off  the  ringer  you have merely silenced  the  transducer,  not 
removed the circuit from the line.

     When the telephone company uses the ringer to test the line, 
it  sends  a  low-voltage, low frequency  signal  down  the  line 
(usually  2 Volts at 10 Hz) to test for continuity.  The  company 
keeps records of the expected signals on your line.  This is  how 
it  can  tell  you have added equipment to your  line.   If  your 
telephone has had its ringer disconnected, the telephone  company 
cannot detect its presence on the line.

     Because there is only a certain amount of current  available 
to  drive ringers, if you keep adding ringers to your phone  line 
you will reach a point at which either all ringers will cease  to 
ring, some will cease to ring, or some ringers will ring  weakly.  
In  the  United States the phone company will guarantee  to  ring 
five  normal ringers.  A normal ringer is defined as  a  standard 
gong  ringer  as  supplied  in  a  phone  company  standard  desk 
telephone.   Value  given to this ringer  is  Ringer  Equivalence 
Number  (REN)  1.  If you look at the FCC registration  label  of 
your  telephone, modem, or other device to be connected   to  the 
phone line, you'll see the REN number.  It can be as high as 3.2, 
which  means  that device consumes the equivalent  power  of  3.2 
standard ringers, or 0.0, which means it consumes no current when 
subjected  to  a  ringing  signal.  If  you  have  problems  with 
ringing,  total  up your RENs; if the total is  greater  than  5, 
disconnect ringers until your REN is at 5 or below.

     Other  countries  have various ways of expressing  REN,  and 
some  systems  will handle no more than three of  their  standard 
ringers.  But whatever the system, if you add extra equipment and 
the  phones  stop ringing, or the phone answering  machine  won't 
pick  up  calls,  the solution is disconnect  ringers  until  the 
problem  is resolved. Warbling ringers tend to draw less  current 
than  gong  ringers, so changing from gong  ringers  to  warbling 
ringers may help you spread the sound better.

     Frequency response is the second criterion by which a ringer 
is  described.   In  the  United States  most  gong  ringers  are 
electromechanically  resonant.  They are usually resonant  at  20 
and  30 Hz (+&- 3 Hz).   The FCC refers to this as A so a  normal 
gong ringer is described as REN 1.0A.  The other common frequency 
response  is  known as type B.  Type B ringers  will  respond  to 
signals between 15.3 and 68.0 Hz.  Warbling ringers are all  type 
B  and some United States gong ringers are type B.   Outside  the 
United States, gong ringers appear to be non-frequency selective, 
or type B.

     Because a ringer is supposed to respond to AC waveforms,  it 
will tend to respond to transients (such as switching transients) 
when the phone is hung up, or when the rotary dial is used on  an 
extension phone.  This is called "bell tap" in the United States; 
in  other  countries,  it's often called  "bell  tinkle."   While 
European  and  Asian phones tend to bell tap, or  tinkle,  United 
States ringers that bell tap are considered defective.  The  bell 
tap  is  designed out of gong ringers and fine  tuned  with  bias 
springs.   Warbling  ringers  for use in the  United  States  are 
designed  not  to respond to short transients;  this  is  usually 
accomplished  by  rectifying the AC and filtering  it  before  it 
powers the IC,  then not switching on the output stage unless the 
voltage lasts long enough to charge a second capacitor.
 

Conclusion

     This  brief  primer  describing  the  working  parts  of   a 
telephone is intended to provide a better understanding of  phone 
equipment.    Note  that  most  telephone  regulatory   agencies, 
including the FCC, forbid modification of anything that has  been 
previously approved or attached to phone lines.

This is my RANT on Comdex.  If you have a problem with it "please direct it to 
that brick wall over there..."

                          Comdex 98 fuckin SUCKED!

                          DAY 1
                          Since things didn't go as planned I'll just give you a
                          synopsis on what went on the first day.

                          We started off (at 4:00 AM) going to pick up aphex, and
                          lasik, but it turns out that they left on their own. So
                          Calico, XiT, nhilisis, and I hauled ass to Vegas
                          ourselves. We spend 5hrs in the worlds largest fucken
                          oven. When at last we arrived at Vegas we checked into
                          the Mirage hotel, and were bound for the Las Vegas
                          Convention center at which Comdex was held. Finding a
                          parking space was fucken hell. We ended up parking
                          about 1mile away from the registration tent. Once we
                          got in we exhaustedly spent a lot of the afternoon at the
                          test center. We tested various devices one of the
                          mechanisms being the new Bay Stack 450 switch, and
                          then spent some time setting up slackware 3.4 on all
                          the subordinate half assed windows systems. After
                          fucking around with the computers for awhile we met up
                          with psychosis, and a a rep from ZDNET for an interview.
                          Then a little later we checked out all the different booths
                          (taking all the free shit we could get.) Then we checked
                          out the redhat booth (XiT took a copy of redhat 5.2 which
                          was later eventually used to simulate an imatation of a
                          UFO ) soon afterward we headed to the UUNET
                          Technologies booth. After hanging with the folks at
                          UUNET we headed back to the redhat linux booth to
                          laugh at the venders(they were sporting homosexual
                          little redish sherlock holmes hats. Damn commie
                          bastards) after poking fun we went over to the FreeBsd
                          booth. someone recognized the "Legions Interactive"
                          (LoU) on the name tags and gave us some BSD
                          shirts(which were otherwise $16, and a total rip off). We
                          got tired of walking around all day so we took a break.
                          While we were kicking back Calico decides to go fucken
                          camera crazy and starts flashing snap shots like he was
                          fucken filming a model. At any rate the camera got
                          taken away by some fuck nut security guard who didn't
                          want to be filmed. We argued with the asshole for about
                          10minutes before we resolved that it was a no win
                          predicament so we took off. Most of the Comdex footage
                          we got was on the other role of film. Whatever we ended
                          up with is posted below. And so concludes this years
                          trip to Comdex. We'll be back next year. Hopefully next
                          year more members can tag along (and don't
                          "inadvertently" leave without letting anyone know).

[Brief History]
Jonathan B. Postel was a tantrum computer scientist who played a central role in developing and maintaining many of the Internets core technologies.  Pastel who was 55 when he did in Oct was part of the team of engineers that in 1969, created the software for ARPAnet, the military research network that evolved into the Internet.  He was best known for his role as head of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, the technical body that has overseen the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) and allocated Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the fundamental technologies for navigating and routing on the Net.  Over the past two years, Postel and the IANA (www.iana.org) were in the midst of the stormy debate over the future of domain names.  In 1996 Postel led an effort to introduce new top-level domains to the Internet, a proposal that attracted so much attention and resulted in such discord that the U.S. government which ahs legally retained authority over the Domain Name System- Intervened last year as an arbiter.  Although he grew to notoriety through, IANA, Postel's more enduring contributions to the Internet are his technical achievements in helping to create and document the Internet's underlying technologies, including IP, and DNS.


Short Time Line--

1969- Jon Postel assists in the installation of the ARPAnet's first communications switch.
1984- A group of engineers agrees upon seven so-called top-level domains reflecting their 
      respective use: .gov, .net, .com, .org, edu, and .int.
1985- the first domain registered is symbolics.com on March 15
1988- The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority is started in December. Postel is appointed
      Director.  The organization allocates blocks of Internet addresses to interested
      organizations.
1993- NSF requests proposals to run the .com, .net, .org, and .gov dns services known as
      InterNIC.  The contract is awarded to Network Solutions Inc.
1996- Postel proposes to the Internet society that new top-level domains be created. 
      Each of 50 registries would administer three of the new domains.
1998- Postel "redirects" five of the 12 Internet directory servers to get data about 
     where every domain name in the world is located from his machine at the University 
     or Southern California, rather than from a server at NSI's Virginia headquarters. 
     The test was initiated without warning NSI or the government.
