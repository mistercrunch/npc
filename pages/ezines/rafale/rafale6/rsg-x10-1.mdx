RSG-X10-1

Recently 2600 magazine had a cool article called "Warspying." In the
article they describe how to use a X10 video receiver in yer car to spy
on wireless
video cameras as you drive around town. Sounds fun, so here at RSG we
figured we'd give it a shot. Ideal for walking, this version is compact
and battery-powered.

First, assemble your parts:


5" video screen
2.4GHz wireless video (X10) receiver
RCA cable
12 volt battery

We got the screen and the receiver from some mail order place. They're
maybe a hundred bucks each, but you can probably find them cheaper.
The cable you probably have sitting around the house already. The
battery is just a Radio Shack special (around $20), or you can rig your
own battery pack depending on whatever screen/receiver you buy.

(Optional: instead of the video screen, go directly out of the receiver
into your camcorder. Not only will you be able to record, but most people=

will probably mistake you for a tourist and leave you alone.)

Second, attach the power cables from the screen and the receiver to the
battery. You can get all fancy here, but just snip the power cables in
half,
and discard the adapter end. Then, strip the wires and attach the bare
wires to the terminals on the battery.

Then use the RCA cable to connect the screen to the receiver. Then wrap
it all up with some tape.
Gosh, that was easy ;-)


Now yer all set. We would suggest putting it in a bag or something
otherwise the Department of Homeland Insecurity might start asking you
questions.


And that's it! We tried this model out at the Open Swap on April 26,
2003 in New York City. After walking for about a half a block across
13th Street, we got a picture. It was a security camera picture of some
interior hallway. Must have been in a nearby building.

Have fun video sniffing!
