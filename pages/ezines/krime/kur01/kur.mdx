 Welcome to the first  public-release of a new KRiME Underground Report. As 
 always  dedicated to the free  information of the  computer related themes, 
 this issue is a compilation  of text files writened to be shared as public.
  
 Use it in any damn way you want, but please, try to leave it as the original 
 we're really tired and bored of chasing fake versions. 
  
 If you have any questions about anything, please feel free to contact us at 
 any  KRiME site.  The usuals !%@&#$@%  are also welcomed. Be sure to let us 
 know if you discover anything interesting at the underground media.
 

                                                        Alan May, K·R·i·M·E.
