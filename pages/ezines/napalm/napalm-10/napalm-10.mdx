[=] 0x00: Editor's Comments

A chunk of my commentary that I included in the last issue was published 
in Information Security magazine. (See "Hacker 'Zines and Informatioon 
Security Magazine" in issue 9) You can see it online at

http://www.infosecuritymag.com/articles/february01/departments_talk_back.shtml

Not much new with the Napalm crew here, except that this issue is bound to 
be considerably smaller than usual. Everybody's submissions just started 
slowing down over New Year's Day and many of our contributors' winter 
breaks. On the personal front, I've quit my job and started a security 
consulting company for small businesses in my corner of the world. If

I have one addition to Azure's article on IP hijacking on cable modem
networks... This generally won't work if you don't answer to an ARP
request for the additional IP's you're doing static NAT for. 

There are two ways to make that happen:

1) Static ARP:

arp -s IP.you.want.to.snag [MAC address of your outside interface]

2) IP aliasing:

ifconfig (adapter) alias IP.you.want.to.snag

The better of the two would be static arp, since 'ifconfig alias blah'
will cause services on your firewall to start listening on that address
as well, depending on your setup.

Hello,

I realize that this article is quite old, however I only recently 
discovered and started reading Napalm.

I wanted to discuss one small point with you concerning your quantum
cryptography article - I realize it is very likely that in the 1.5 years
since you wrote this that you have already considered this fact. I think
it is very important though, so just in case I am bringing it up here.

An excerpt from your article:

  It will happen eventually. Somebody will figure out a way to factor
  large prime numbers, and, if you didn't know already, will break a 
  decent number of the 'military-grade' cryptographic algorithms out  
  there today.

I would like to put forth that at the present time, there is no
mathematical _proof_ that factoring large prime numbers is a so-called
"hard" problem. This is what you are talking about above. Therefore, as
you are suggesting, someone could come along and prove that it is an
_easy_ problem.

[ Quite right. {kynik} ]

[ By definition, factoring large prime numbers (or any prime number) is 
  not NP-hard, it's impossible. Period. If a number has positive factors 
  other than one and itself, it isn't prime. {echo8} ]

[ Ok, now I feel silly. I was quoted as predicting that people would be 
  able to factor large primes. I meant to say "large numbers", where 
  someone would factor them to try to _determine_ if they are prime. Of 
  course you can't factor primes, and I think the subscriber followed my 
  semantic misstep. My apologies, all. {kynik} ]

However, given what we know up to this point regarding this problem, it 
is equally as likely that someone could come up with a mathematical 
_proof_ that it _is_ a hard problem.

[ For those readers out there who are interested in knowing what the 
  difference between a "hard" and an "easy" problem, plug "NP hard" into 
  your favorite search engine. For those of you masochists, try this URL:
  http://hissa.nist.gov/dads/HTML/nphard.html  {kynik} ]

[ The issue of proof is also unclear. Nobody has yet proved that P != NP. 
  There are also problems which are provably non-computable. Number  
  theory is like that. {echo8} ]

[ Interesting things come up when you try to apply parallel computation to 
  problems that can't be solved in polynomial time serially. The little 
  bit of number theory I got into in grad school didn't really touch on 
  this, besides saying that everything gets more complex, as you'd 
  probably expect. {kynik} ]

That is, insofar as the security of XYZ cryptosystem relies on factoring
large primes being a "hard" problem, it is possible that we could someday
_prove_ that the cryptosystem is secure against a non-brute-force attack.  
It is, of course, equally possible that we could _prove_ that it is _not_ 
an easy problem, at which point XYZ cryptosystem would be secure until 
they figured out how to solve that "easy" problem (which would probably 
happen simultaneously as they discover that it is an "easy" problem).

I am enjoying your magazine as I catch up on the back issues.

[=] 0x03: Chaffing as an Alternative to Encryption (Part I)

  I remember reading Rivest's paper on chaffing[1] and being blown away 
by the simplicity of the idea, not to mention the practical applications. 
I told myself, "Self, you can write this, and it'd make a damn fine 
secure file transfer method." So I thought about it, scribbled some stuff 
down on a sheet of paper and forgot about it for about 6 months. I 
noticed the copy of Rivest's paper in an abandoned directory and the 
wheel started turning again. During my visit to San Francisco, I managed 
to write almost all of the enchaffing and dechaffing pieces. I'm at a 
point right now where I just need to debug and the libraries are done. 
So let me explain what all of this babbling of mine is about.

  Chaffing is the insertion of fake pieces into a message, so that anyone 
eavesdropping on the message won't know which part is legitimate and which 
is the chaff. Let's say we wanted to enchaff a simple message. This 
example is from Rivest's paper. The enchaffed message might look something 
like this:

    (1,Hi Larry,532105)
    (1,Hi Bob,465231)
    (2,Meet me at,782290)
    (2,I'll call you at,793122)
    (3,6PM,891231)
    (3,7PM,344287)
    (4,Yours-Susan,553419)
    (4,Love-Alice,312265) 

  You can't really be sure what the entire message is supposed to be 
without knowing what's going on. The first number is a sequence number, 
which basically allows the receiver to put the message pieces in the right 
order, if they happen to be deliberately mixed. The third field is a keyed
hash, which basically means, "Append the secret key to the message and get 
the [MD5 or whichever] hash." This way, only someone who knows the secret 
key can easily determine which hash is correct, and thus, what the real 
message is. Standard key-exchange algorithms such as Diffie-Hellman can be 
used to transmit this key.
  You can get even more complicated here by throwing a variable number of 
chaff pieces into the message, perhaps with a probability of extra chaffed 
packets. I added this functionality into my preliminary file enchaffing 
and dechaffing routines. (I think I'm going to wait until Napalm 11 to 
actually release the code, as I'd rather it be in a more complete state 
before anybody tried to do anything with it.)
  The biggest problem I've discovered is that generating chaff from 
/dev/random or other random sources only works if your message looks 
pseudo-random. While testing out my enchaffing functions on a text file, 
and skimming through the resulting output, it's pretty clear which part is 
the message and which part is the chaff. The strength of the enchaffing 
program depends directly on how good the chaff-generation function is.
  This problem can be somewhat avoided by using another of Rivest's 
suggestions. He suggests that before the entire message is enchaffed, a 
'package transform' or 'all-or-nothing transform' is applied. This 
transform makes it impossible to retrieve the original message unless the 
entire transformed message is received. Presumably, (I haven't 
actually implemented this yet, though that's next in my priority list 
on this project) this transform would make a text file look pseudo-random 
and therefore it'd be much harder to determine what was chaff and what was 
part of the real message. It would also be possible and not a bad idea to 
compress the file before it's package transformed, to reduce the amount of 
data that needs to be sent, and to remove the plaintext componenets of the 
message.
  So what, right? This is basically encryption. It sure seems like it, but 
it's technically not, which is the beauty of it. The package transform is 
not encryption. Rivest explains this:

    The packaging operation can be undone by anyone who receives the 
    packaged message; as noted, packaging is not encryption and there are 
    no shared secret keys involved in the packaging operation.  

The chaffing operation also is not encryption, since the sender is only 
transmitting authenticated packets, with the important message part sent 
in the clear. (Well, in a packaged form in the clear) Since these methods 
do not involve encryption, a user can sidestep many laws regarding 
encryption while still having a certain degree of confidentiality. Rivest 
explains this sidestepping in greater detail in his paper than I will 
here.

Expect to have a working file-enchaffer by Napalm 11. Hopefully I can 
include a package transform and a compression component with it. I'm very 
interested in hearing what you all think about this, and any ideas that 
would improve or possibly defeat this. Feel free to email me at 
kynik@firest0rm.org

[=] 0x04: How I Got Myself Into The Comp-Sec World

[ This article is from a subscriber who wishes to remain anonymous. Any 
  commentary on this may be sent to kynik@firest0rm.org and I can forward 
  it on. {kynik} ]

How I Got Myself into the Comp-Sec World
or
It May Sound Funny, but I Learned Hacking at School


  I don't post to Bugtraq. I don't release stuff on Packetstorm (either 
the code is too dumb or too cool to make it public). I'm not a member of 
a crew. You don't know me. If you know my handle, forget it, tomorrow 
it's different. I'm not kewl nor 31337. I'm not a wordclass-hacker (in 
fact I settle myself somewhere between a cracker and a hacker), nor am I 
a member of the "Underground" (if it still exists). I'm not perfect, I'm 
no wizard; there are kids that are younger than me who know more than 
twice as much as I do.

  The better days of my all too short youth I spend in a top-notch  
boarding school somewhere in Europe. It was quite a traditional one, 
yeah, one with church every Sunday and ultrasmartasses learning all day. 
But there were also different people, people like me. Dudes who did their 
own stuff and didn't care a lot about what parents or teachers told us. 
Well, we went to school, did our homework, smoked when it was possible, 
drank ourselves near delirium every other weekend. School didn't matter, 
we had good grades and when we had problems we helped each other (the 
kind of guys that fuck the prom queen).

  My buddies and I had a lot of different hobbies (rugby, drama, art,  
etc.) but we had one hobby we all shared: computer games. We were addicted 
to all sorts of games. Many I have forgotten since then, but some, like 
Doom, or all the Sid Meier games are burned into my brain forever. 
Computers weren't widely distributed at that time - it was '94. The masses
hadn't realised there were computer networks or people like "hackers". 
1995 was the year that would change a lot. Windows 95 came out, changed 
the world (and then crashed). Suddenly there were ads for internet service 
providers like CompuServe, the school got a LAN "for educational purposes" 
and we realised that computers could be serious fun when connected 
together. A serial connection was ok, if we did nothing special but for 
file sharing a real LAN would be better. Articles in computer magazines 
encouraged us, there was no discussion, we installed one (expensive 
10Mbit-ISA-cards and BNC-Cable).

  It was all too fascinating, a new world for us to play with. A few 
months all ran well, but after the summer, someone nearly slipped from the 
roof of our main dormitory (if the roof had been wet he'd been straight 
dead). The authorities thought about it, then they budgeted 10000$ to 
install a LAN in the complete school and dorm buildings.

  In '96 my buddies and I were absolute power users in networking (in our
opinions). We knew everything there was to know about setting up ethernet 
networks. From the box of our minix-dude we learned that there were
strange OS's out there and finally came into contact with Linux. It was 
strange because our world was totally dominated by M$ (and 4dos + some 
other enhancements). I hated it. Some loved it because of the anti-MS 
aspect - they weren't able to handle their Win 3.x and 95 stuff right. 
(They weren't so leet in M$ than I was, hehehe). Well, most of these 
Linux-tryers don't use it anymore. It was too shitty then. Now they don't 
touch it because they think it's still crap.

  With the growth of the internet, finally the school got the idea that
internet-access would be a cool thing for a elite boarding school. Well, 
guess who were the morons that had to work out that NAT/proxy/cable/
internet stuff? Yep, it was me and two of my friends plus a strange guy 
who was known as a hardcore Linux user in our school (he always laughed at 
our windows problems). I thought I knew a lot about networking.  *doh*.  
That router installation was a real kick in the ass for me and a wake-up 
call not to be so arrogant. It was hard work, but finally linux ran on 
that box (I think it was Redhat 4.x (or 5.x?)). It ran Linux because the 
school didn't want to buy another NetWare license. I would have preferred 
NT 3.51, but no one would listen to me. That protocol stuff was strange - 
yeah, packets cool - I know about packets, sir.

  We started with a 33.6 connection, which was fine if you used it on  
your own, what you only could to at night. So I stayed up and surfed the 
net in the early mornings, my monitor killing my eyes, my body yearning 
for sleep. After a week I found the first DoS tool (note: on 
www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/ which would later develop into 
Packetstorm). Well, came there by accident, I was happy I had found 
something mighty. "...will crash your computer....OOB....bluescreen".
Wait a minute, this is cool, I can crash other peoples boxes so I get the
connection to the net for myself. Cool. In the following week, many people 
came to the conclusion that blue wasn't a pretty colour in the end.

  In the next edition of our favourite computer magazine all was discussed 
and soon after that patches were released. Finally, tools were released 
that could even kick my beloved NT in the ass. One day I was in a VERY bad 
mood (because of a girl ;). I flooded and DoS'd our gateway to death. I 
tried every tool I had and after a while the box didn't answer my pings 
anymore. I don't know why I actually did it. I simply did (and it worked).

  Just to see the bluescreen (if it was blue on linux) I went with the 
admin (the hardcore Linux user) to the gateway. Our admin had a very old 
box - it was rumoured it was a 486 (very slow compared to our PII's; in 
fact, it was a p100) and ran on Linux devel-kernel-code only (which was 
like a area52 to us M$-Users). He was someone who knew how to use gdb and 
gcc perfectly, my Linux friends "feared" him and I didn't get a clue out 
of him.

  He, a guy with glasses and too much pizza-muscles on his hips, showed me 
the box: no bluescreen. He logged himself in, did some crazy shit, well 
and we were back on the internet in less than a minute.

  Utilising strange commands I had never seen like "ifconfig -a" and
"ps faux" he checked the box.

"Hey, wait a minute, what's that?" I asked.
"That would be a task manager in your eyes, but this is Linux, this is a 
 better world."
"Hmm. What is the most extreme shit you can do with Linux?"
"You can code a world, man. Source code, FREE source code, you can code 
 your own kernel, YOUR stuff. You can make the computer do exactly what 
 YOU want."
"It sounds interesting, but I won't use it. I don't wanna format my HD."

He turned around and looked in my eyes.
"Do you know the word 'multi-user'?"

  Seconds later I was on my first telnet session ever, exploring the 
admin's box from a user account.
"This is cool. It's so different. Is this DOS? What's the most extreme 
 you can do with remote boxes? Crash them?"

The admin grinned.
"No...you can hack them. Break into them. Make them give you admin 
 rights, so you have god-like control."
"Show me. Now."
"No, you gotta learn for yourself. But if you have good questions I will 
 maybe answer them."
I begged and asked again. He refused.

  From that day on I was logged on to that admins box daily. My best 
friend was "man", afterwards came "less" to read the RFC's (which was 
really hard work the first time). In my senior year I took a computer 
science class in school, which was a good decision because the teacher (a 
new one) taught us about algorithms and C. Together with a few books and 
advice from our admin, a lot of time, caffeine and long nights in front of 
my box I learned to hack. The school's LAN was my playground where I 
could test everything I wanted without fear. A few months before 
graduation we got a E1 (2Mbit) and a Cisco. Protected by NAT and not 
existing log files about internet usage I explored the Internet and had a
very good time. The time I finished school I was familiar with Linux, NT 
and Netware and had a deep understanding of TCP/IP Networking.

  I'm very happy someone introduced me to the world of Linux and free 
software, else I'd perhaps still be a DoS-Kiddie. I've been to university 
for a while now (and I've found another LAN to mess with) and sometimes 
miss the time I had at school. NT and Win2000 are my "research field" at 
the moment, but I plan to sell some stufff so I can afford a whole box for 
*BSD, which didn't get enough attention by me in the past.

[ Good man...I'm a BSD fan myself. {kynik} ]

Yes, I can say, I really learned something at school.

[=] 0x05: Security Hole in Shareplex 2.x

Summary 
-------

  Shareplex (Quest Software's product for Oracle database replication)
contains a security hole which can allow local users to read any file on
the system, effectively bypassing the permissions set at the OS level. 

Details
-------

  One of the scripts called when the product is installed (root.post)
contains the following block of code: 

update_permissions()
{
    if  get_mark marker OPT DIR; then
        :
    else
        get_mark marker OPT.$ORAVER DIR
    fi
    OD=$MARK

    chown root $OD/bin/sp_cop
    chmod 4555 $OD/bin/sp_cop

    chown root $OD/bin/CleanSP
    chmod 4550 $OD/bin/CleanSP

    chown root $OD/bin/qview
    chmod 4555 $OD/bin/qview

    ...

    chown root $OD/install/splex_remove_script
    chmod 4555 $OD/install/splex_remove_script

    get_mark rootpre SPLEX GROUP
    SPLEX_GROUP=$MARK
    chgrp $SPLEX_GROUP $MARKERFILE
    chown root $MARKERFILE
    chmod o-w $MARKERFILE
}

  This assigns ownership of several application binaries to root, and 
then sets permissions on them to read & execute by everyone, and suid to 
root. The qview utility, which is used for cleaning out queues among 
other things, is one of the tools which is installed mode 4555. It has a 
feature which can compromise system security when executed with superuser
privileges.

  qview's cmd command (which is used to execute qview commands stored in 
a file) opens any user-specified file and attempts to execute each line 
the file contains. Any errors encountered are echoed to standard output. 
A user who can execute qview can use this behavior to read files on the
system to which they do not legitimately have access. As the target file
will contain data other than qview commands, that data will be echoed out
to stdout along with error messages.

  I did not attempt a comprehensive audit of this product. There are a 
lot of utilities installed suid-root, and this may not be the only one 
that contains vulnerabilities. 

Demonstration 
-------------

$ id
uid=500(foo) gid=200(bar)
$ cd &lt;path to shareplex binaries>
$ ./qview
qdump> cmd /etc/shadow
Executing: root:xDmyz1K9xRKRo:11236::::::
invalid command root:xDmyz1K9xRKRo:11236::::::
...
Executing: splex:BdJCfh1D32hzo:11290::::::
invalid command splex:BdJCfh1D32hzo:11290::::::
Executing: foo:2MQXUgAcnOcEU:11344::::::
invalid command foo:2MQXUgAcnOcEU:11344::::::
qdump> quit
$ 

Vulnerable Versions
-------------------

  The same version of root.post is shipped for each of the supported 
unixes (Solaris 2.6, HP/UX 10.20 & 11.00, AIX 3 and OSF/1 4.0). I would 
expect qview to display the same behavior on each of these OSes, but I 
tested only on Solaris 2.6.  

I tested Shareplex 2.1.3.9 and 2.2.2 (Beta, 11/02/00). 

Workaround
----------

  As currently implemented, qview needs to run as root in order to 
operate correctly. However, the risk can be somewhat mitigated by 
changing the permissions on qview to 4550, and making it group-owned by a 
group containing only highly-trusted users. This is not a complete 
solution to the problem, as any user who is still allowed to run qview 
can still access files to which they should not have access under any 
circumstances (such as the shadow file). 

Vendor Notification/Patches
---------------------------

The vendor was notified on 2/2/2001.

The issue is patched in SharePlex 2.1.3.21 and above. The patched version of
qview seems to remove the offending fuctionality completely. 

[ This, and most of echo8's previous bug reports goes to show you that 
  just because something is expensive (I'm assuming that SharePlex is 
  expensive, and I know Sun Clustering is) doesn't mean it's received the 
  sort of scrutiny you'd expect for your money. Buyer beware! {kynik} ]

[=] 0x06: Intro to Cryptographic Filesystems

  This document is meant to provide a basic introduction to the facilities
provided by the crypto support in the Linux kernel.

  For those of you who might be a bit daunted by the words "Encryption" 
and "Filesystem", I present you an introduction to the linux crypto 
support.

Part 1 -- What Is It?

Encryption is the act of concealing from view the data stored on the  
disk. 

  Most filesystems do not encrypt the data stored on them. The best reason 
for not encrypting data is the "why?" factor. Encrypting and decrypting 
data consume valuble processor cycles. If there is no reason to encrypt 
the data, there's equally no reason to waste the cycles. This argument is 
a bit similar to data compression, but that is outside the scope of this 
article.

  But suppose there is a reason to encrypt the data. On an unencrypted
filesystem, the data may be read directly. Essentially, whatever is on 
the disk is available to anyone who might get their stinking paws on it. 
Your letters to Aunt Sally might not be all too important, but our friends 
at Los Alamos are singing quite a different tune when it comes to 
sensitive data. 

Part 2 -- How Does Linux do It?

[ The actual Crypto API is the subject of my second article, so hang with 
  me you prime number and hash table freaks. {kp2} ]

  Linux uses a loopback filesystem (there's a HOWTO on these at
linuxdoc.org) for its crypto chores. A loopback filsystem is basically a 
file that contains its own filesystem. Linux provides the facility to 
associate this file with a block device named /dev/loop&lt;x>. Once the file 
is looped, it may be mounted and treated like a regular filesystem. That's 
where the crypto comes in. With crypto support compiled in, linux can 
encrypt the blocks that compose the filesystem and its files. This means 
that the looped file is completely unreadable without the key.

Part 3 -- That's Cool, How do I do it?

Actually using an encrypted fs is so simple, it will blow your mind. 
Here's a quick starter:

First, you need to head over to www.kerneli.org and grab the patch
appropriate for your kernel.

Run patch -p1 < &lt;patch name goes here> in the kernel source directory.

Remeber to gunzip that baby first!

Now head back over to kerneli.org and grab a copy of the HOWTO and (!!) 
read it. Remember that Documentation/crypto in the kernel source dir has 
some useful info.

You will need to recompile losetup and mount from utils-linux after 
applying a patch to that source (detailed instructions are in the HOWTO). 
You will also need to recompile your kernel with crypto support built in 
either as a module or into the kernel.

Part 4 -- Kp2, you're so cool, where can I find out more?

kerneli.org is a great start. If you're interested in algorithms, check 
out Mastering C (or Perl)  Algorithms from your local library or whatever.
Applied Cryptography is another great book, but a little much for the
weekend hacker. I'm also aware that google.com is always an excellent 
source of info.

Part 5 -- Epilogue

This is a preliminary article. The next one will begin to introduce the
actual Crypto API (with... drumroll please... examples!). Depending on 
the interest in the subject, I just might end up writing a cryptology 
tutorial. You never know :P

I managed to get my hands on a few songs from Fear Factory's upcoming 
album "Digimortal", since I'm a huge fan. If any of you know about the 
band, this release sits somewhere between Obsolete and Demanufacture. It's 
much heavier than the last album, but it's got some quirks. I think the 
guys from FF have been in the spotlight too much, though, and there's 
little hints of new metal in there, even more than there were before. 
I don't want to say that the songs sound formulaic, because the songs I 
have are very unique from each other. It's just that you can sorta tell 
when he's going to start screaming or break down into a lighter melodic 
part. I won't spoil it too much more for you, but if you're a metal fan, 
buy this when it comes out in April. (A single should be out by the time 
this issue is released.)

Nile's second full-length CD, "Black Seeds of Vengeance" is death metal. 
I'm not using that as a derogatory term, either. I like death metal quite 
a lot. Unfortunately, most of it that I've heard over the past year or so 
has been recycled-sounding and not terribly interesting. In order for 
death metal bands to make it nowadays, they have to have some sort of 
gimmick to be recognized. Nile's gimmick is an ancient-Egyptian theme, 
in full force with strange sounding percussion, tribal-sounding chants and 
(presumably) some ancient egyptian lyrics. You would never have thought 
that they were just four guys from South Carolina. I've seen Nile twice 
live, and everybody except the drummer contributes to vocals, which helps 
to make it quite intense. This second CD seems to be faster than their 
first, and it's still enjoyable and doesn't sound like the same tracks as 
the previous. If you're not into death metal, you probably won't like 
this, but who knows, maybe they'll play Lilith Fair this year.

ajax's Rating, "Farstucker"
---------------------------

Overall     - 17/20 (85%)

"Farstucker" is the new album from the incorrigible Lords of Acid, who
have a bit of a reputation for being, let's say, overt. Hey, when the 
name of your last album was "Pussy", people infer things. (And I'm sure 
you've all figured out what Farstucker is a mutation of.) That proud 
tradition continues on their new CD; songs with names like "Pain and 
Pleasure Concerto", "Stripper", "Scrood Bi U" and "Lick My Chakra" and 
lyrics that would make your parents uncomfortable are the rule here. 
However, the Lords stretch out musically on this album, and it's a nice 
break from the porno-house of "Sit On My Face" or "Crablouse". The first 
few tracks sound like L7 (if they were mixed by, say, Lunatic Calm). 
"Slave To Love" fools you into thinking it's a hard house track before 
sliding into an extremely laid back groove. And "Get Up, Get High" is 
destined to become a jock rock anthem (which is not an insult in this 
case). If you've heard the Lords before, you'll be impressed by their 
range on this one. If you haven't, you'll almost certainly find something 
you like. Hell, if it weren't a song about cross-dressing and casual 
threesomes, "I Like It" could play on the radio. Get this one.
