                                #windows95!#$!@

The scene starts as I collide off about 8 or so ops and hax wit da
eliteo splitz.                  - wooperz

&lt;WoopZ> LETS TALK ABOUT WHY MICROSOFT FUXN SUX

[preach on brutha..]

&lt;SeaMutt> Somebody op me please...

[If you didn't know, bots without ops like to have a nag phrase
 for the channel they are in, until they get opped. This is 
 just one more reason bots suck.]

&lt;ZorlaK> somebody op me please...

[Tell me this isn't annoying. The person(s) who own these bots 
 are probably not even at their computer, while the rest of
 the channel suffers]

&lt;Spankster> time to hack ops
