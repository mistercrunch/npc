                         +-------------------------+

                                                 
             Special Thanks to "m" for his sharp wit and clever 
                             take-over technique.

                     
        What could be more depressing than having your channel taken over?  
We decided to find out.  In order to get the best results, we chose 
#depressed as our target.  Here is what they had to say...
