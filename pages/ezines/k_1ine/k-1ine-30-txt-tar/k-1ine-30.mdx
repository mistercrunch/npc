 Review of 'VoodooMagickBox'

 Many science fiction writers, hackers, and techies have discussed the future as
 a place where wetware technology is prevalent in our lives. One idea that floats
 around in these circles is that of "digital drugs". A person, sometimes an habitual
 drug user, would have a piece of small computer hardware which they would hook up to
 a part of their body, and instantly endure affects - head rush, body high, feelings
 of ecstasy. The digital drug wouldn't have any negative side effects, long-term brain
 damage, or even contain traces of itself in the users body... albeit the perfect drug.

 Of course we all know this type of sci-fi technology couldn't possibly exist today, 
 right? Think again, because VoodooMagickBox does just that! The first time I was told
 about this piece of technology, I was a little bit skeptical. I asked myself: "This
 little box is going to make me feel like I've had two martinis, or some narcotic? No
 way!" Well my friends, those claims are completely true.


 The Experience...

 When I was originally handed the VoodooMagickBox, I was told that I would need to dabble
 a small amount of electro-gel on to two ear clips that were attached to a wire that went
 directly into the box. Then I was told to place the two clips on my ears and slowly turn
 the knob on the box until I felt a small resistance. I proceeded to follow the instructions.
 Slowly I turned the knob, and within 30-45 seconds I knew something was happening because
 everything around me appeared to be breathing. This "breathing" could be described (by some)
 as a "mini-hallucination".

 Shortly after the hallucination started, I noticed small bursts of light in my peripheral
 vision, followed by a feeling of happiness. The happiness can only be described as the same
 feeling one would get if they drank a glass of strong wine, a couple of martinis, or even
 smoked marijuana. After approximately 15 minutes, I decided to take the ear clips off and
 stand up to see if I'd still feel "high". Walking was a somewhat difficult task at first,
 as my balance felt a bit off and I was still hallucinating and seeing bursts of light from
 the sides of my eyes. Shortly after, the visual affects wore off, but I still had an ecstasy-
 like feeling coming over me. For two days I was happier than usual, and didn't feel any anxi-
 ety; something I've been unsuccessfully trying to deal with my entire life. With the continued
 use with VoodooMagickBox, I can honestly say it helped the minor anxiety disappear, which is
 something I never expected to happen from using this box! The perfectly safe, legal, recreat-
 ional digital drug? Hell yeah!
 
 I've recommended it to all my friends and they too have told me they have the same great trips
 from it. Now I recommend it to you. Has this story made you curious? If so, I suggest purchasing
 Voodoo Magick Box. Thank you for reading my review, and I hope you enjoy this incredible product
 as much as I have!

  Hey all,

 Well... where to start? The Voodoo Magick Box... This little toy is incredible. I still remember
 my first trip about two weeks ago... I know this sounds a bit crazy, but I actually prefer it to
 alcohol, smoking weed, hash, or poppin' a tab of ecstasy. But its even better when you mix it up.

 How it works: You attach two little clips to your earlobes. Then you turn the Magick Box on. There
 is a dial to adjust the strength. You will feel it working immediately. You turn it up slowly to a
 strong, but comfortable level, then sit back and enjoy...

 What it does: It's as good as any drug or alcohol induced trip. Almost immediately, you'll notice a
 flashing-strobe light in your peripheral vision. You wouldn't believe how cool it is when you're tos-
 sing a couple back at the bar or going hardcore at a rave. Everything seems so surreal, like you're
 dreaming. You're happy as hell and it's like you just slammed back a couple shots of tequila. Honest
 to god, you feel as drunk as you want to be. Your body is lighter and you can party with it all damn
 night. You know that feeling of electricity running over your body after popping a hit of ecstasy.
 Well, times that by like a hundred. You can turn the box off at anytime. Within a couple minutes,
 your back to your normal sober self, except for a couple of intense qualities. Stress seems to disa-
 ppear for hours. You're relaxed and anxiety seems to fade away. That feeling of lightness seems to
 last for a while, kind of a bounce in your step. They say it improves your memory too. Well, I think
 its a bit early for me to tell, but anything is better than the fried mind I've gotten from weed. 

 The kick-ass part: You can take it anywhere and use it anytime. Wanna puff a joint ? Go ahead.
 Afterwards or during, pop the ear clips on and it's an entirely different trip. It's also sustained,
 so it will save you cash. Save cash by not having to 'pick up' as often. Stronger, longer, incredible
 trips. Also, it runs on a 9-volt battery, and is supposed to last up to 500 hours. Fuck'n eh. I'm still
 on my original battery after sharing it with all my friends.

 Still need another reason? SEX. Yes... sex. Wear it while your having sex. Fuck man, my girlfriend had
 the most fucking incredible orgasm while wearing it. Not just once, but she came three times in a row.
 She couldn't even stand for an hour. haha. We're buying a second unit so that both of us can wear one
 while fucking. They have a two person model too, so that kicks the donkey's ass.

 I know many of you reading this are still skeptical... The thing costs about $70 US. You're gonna see
 everybody wearing these boxes in a couple weeks. And for the price of a single 'pick up', you've always
 got it. If you want one, you can click here or send MagicMan an email. He'll set up. If you live in Edmon-
 ton, he might even show up and let you try one out first hand. They've got years of testing behind this
 thing and tons of positive feedback. It 100% safe and 100% legal, so the man can't hassle you about it.
 You've just got a try it to see what you've been missing...

 Peace & Happy Tripping!

Challenge-Response Authentication for Dummys
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

To often, I see hackers design systems that need security, but they
send passwords out as cleartext. Generally, secure authentication is thought
to be difficult to do, and often not worth the trouble. However, in our
networked world, secure authentication is vital. Automated password sniffers
are not only theoretically possible, but doubtlessly already in common
use on large, high-bandwidth routers and NAT devices, placed there by hackers
or crooked network admins.

Ideally, all network communication should be encrypted, but sometimes
this is not necessary, possible, or even legal! In any case, if you do
develop some sort of network program that needs authentication devices,
and you aren't willing to encrypt all traffic, at least use challenge-response
authentication.


What is Challenge-Response Authentication?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Challenge-Response Authentication (CRA) is a method for proving your identity
over an insecure medium without giving any information out to eavsedroppers
that may enable them to identify themselves as you.

It should also be noted that CRA is still secure, even if an attacker can
modify your messages to the server, although, if you send plain-text messages
to the server, and the attacker can still modify THAT, the attacker will just
wait for you to authenticate, then take over your connection.


How does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CRA fundamentally depends on the existance of "one-way hashes". A one-way
hash is a function that takes an input, and returns a "hash". Finding the
input of the function from the hash is "computationally infeasible", which,
in the case of a decent hash function, means you'll be crunching numbers
until the next stone age.

Popular one-way hash functions are MD4, MD5, SHA, and RIPE-MD.

Let's call this one-way function h(). When the client connects to the server,
the server makes up a random value, X. The server sends X to the client.
The client sends the server h(X+P), where P is the password. The servers
computes h(X+P) as well, and checks to see if the data from the client
matches the computed value. If so, the client must know P.

A practical example:

This example uses the common unix utility "md5sum", which hashes the data
on stdin to a 128 bit hash, displayed as 32 hex digits.
This example also substitutes concatenation for addition.


Assume the password is "mysecretpass" and both the client and the server know this.

The client connects to the server.

The server makes up some random data, say "sldkfjdslfkjweifj".

The server sends this data to client.

The client concatenates the random data with the password, resulting in
"sldkfjdslfkjweifjmysecretpass"

The client computes the MD5 hash of this value:

5>doug@saturn:/home/doug$ echo sldkfjdslfkjweifjmysecretpass | md5sum
4fab7ebffd7ef35d88494edb647bac37
5>doug@saturn:/home/doug$

The client sends "4fab7ebffd7ef35d88494edb647bac37" to the server.

The server runs the same command, and since the server (hopefully) got
the same result, it lets the user in.



How does this provide security?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, notice how that the password is never actually sent out in the
clear, and how in order for an attacker to determine the password would
be to bruteforce the hash function: a daunting task.


Miscellaneous Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You understand why this method is called Challenge-Response Authentication
now, don't you? No? Well, I suppose this is a for dummies book after all...
Notice how the server "challenges" the client and it "responds".

A potential weakness in CRA is if the server sends out the same challenge
more than once, an attacker who recorded the hash of the first authentication
can simply replay the hash, gaining access without even knowing the password.
This is easily solved by making the random data large enough to minimize
the odds of such an event as much as you want. Even with 16 random
ASCII characters of data the odds of this happening are 
1 in 340282366920938463463374607431768211456.

Actually, a one-way hash need not be used if you have access to an encryption
function. Just use the encryption function in place of the hash function.
Of course, one more piece of information needs to be kept secret: The key
to the encryption function. May as well just encrypt all traffic, if possible.

One interesting application of CRA is in packet radio. There are 2 reasons
why encrypting the traffic isn't ideal for this medium. Often, packet radio
devices are ancient machines barely even capable of conducting serial
communications (my dad still uses a Tandy t-100!), and don't nearly have the
processing power to handle a stream of encrypted data, but could manage a hash
at the beginning of a conversation, or the operator could even have a hashing
program on his palmtop or whatnot. Secondly, the CRTC has stipulated that
amateur radio operators use no ciphers whatsoever when transmitting on the
airwaves, and this includes packet radio. Now I'm not sure if one-way hashes
are considered ciphers, so it's a bit of a grey area... I hope I get some
ma1lz from the CRTC. Cease and desist. That'd be sweet.

Ah yes, speaking of palmtop hashing programs, none exist that I know of.
Any palm c0d0rz looking for something to do: This would be a very
cool program. Try porting md5sum to the palmtop. You'll probably want to
use RSA's md5sum.c reference implementation as it is much less complicated
than the version your unix system uses. For a copy of this, and a usage
example, (and a pretty neat program if I do say so myself), see my program

Caller ID Spoofing through TELUS
by Lucky225
2002-07-16

This was the prepared speach I had for H2K2 however I got cut off early, there are links
at the bottom for the CID spoofing software mentioned during the con. Automatic Number
Identification, or ANI, was developed by the telephone companies long before Caller ID
and was originally developed for billing purposes only. ANI is a service, similar to
Caller ID, that displays your phone number to the called party when you place a call,
except that because it is used for billing purposes and emergency services you can not
block your phone number. ANI was used by telephone companies to determine what number
to bill when you placed a long distance call. This service soon became available to
toll free numbers and 911 emergency services.

The reason it is available to toll free numbers is that when you call one of these numbers
it's a free call -- to you -- the company or person who owns the toll free number has to
pay for the call, and rates can be different depending on the area the call was placed from,
so even if you block your caller ID, your ANI is still sent to the toll free number.

ANI, because it supposedly can't be blocked, is used as the premisis for (C)LASS services.
What is (C)LASS you ask? well it stands for Custom Local Area Signalling Services. These
services are all the overpriced services that the local phone companies are always trying
to offer to you, such as *69 Call return, *57 Call trace, Caller ID, etc...

Now ANI sounds like the greatest thing since sliced bread, however it is not full-proof.
There are two types of ways ANI can be signaled, the newer way is refered to as ANI II which
provides a 2 digit code along with your phone number that identifies the class of service of
the phone line calling from, for example a payphone's ANI II code is 27, a regular phone is
00, etc... Before ANI II was implemented, the telephone companie's local operator had no way
of re-transmitting the number calling from when placing calls to toll free or local phone
numbers, instead your ANI would simply read the area code of the operator center and that was
it, so if you called a toll free number from a local operator in areacode 909 all that would
show as your ANI is 909, this is known as an ANI fail, and just because the 909 shows up does-
n't necissarily mean you were calling from the 909 areacode, that's just where the operator
was stationed. You can still cause ANI fails today from most local operators though it is said
there are a few that do pass ANI with ANI II equipment.

ANI Fails causes problems for (C)LASS services such as Call Trace or Call Return, if you place
a local call through the operator, though you may be billed operator assited charges so there
is a record of the call being placed, if the person you are calling trys to *57 Call trace you
they will receive a message that the call could not be traced, this is because there was no ANI
provided for the call. Here's where it gets fun, because ANI is used for billing purposes, some-
times when you call a toll-free number that offers Collect, third number billing or Calling Card
services such as 800-Call-ATT, they also use your ANI to put on the phone bill of the person you
call collect or bill third party to, but how can they do this if the call is has an ANI fail?
They can't, so generally instead of the automated system you usually get, you will get an operator
asking where you are calling from and you can give the operator any phone number you want as where
you are calling from. This is where things get interesting. AT&T's operators handle very many calls,
they handle calls that come from their 10102880 dial-around, from long distance customers that dial
00 to reach them and of course from calls that come in over the toll-free number. If the operator is
not paying close attention she will not notice that you dialed a toll free number to reach her, and
you can give her any number you wish as where you are calling from and then say you are a visually
impaired customer and need her to dial a toll free number, she will believe that you dialed 00 to
reach her, which many visually impaired customers do, and not the toll-free number. In the past
AT&T used to use the number you gave them as where you are calling from as ANI and actually passed
that ANI along to any toll free number you called, and other telephone company toll-free numbers
would allow you to bill long distance calls to the ANI you were calling from, bellsouth was one of
these companies, you could simply call 1-800-bellsouth from your home phone and have the operator
place a long distance call and bill it to the number you were calling from, When it was possible
to spoof ANI through AT&T's 800-Call-ATT service, you could give the AT&T any phone number you wish
as where you were calling from, then have her call 800-bellsouth leading her to believe you were a
visually impaired customer and needing assistance dialing that number, then you could press 0 for
the bellsouth operator and have her place a long distance call and have it billed to the number you
gave the AT&T operator because that's the number bellsouth thought you were calling from.

All this has been published in 2600 magazine and is now history, bellsouth has learned from their
mistakes and no longer bills to ANI that comes in over their 800 number, and AT&T does not even pass
ANI to 800 numbers anymore, you can dial 00 or 10-10-288-0 and touch-tone in an 800 number and it will
connect you to that 800 number with a an ANI fail, you don't even have to speak to an operator. The
problem with this is it makes it easier to cause ANI fails, sure it solves the ANI spoofing problem
but now you can toll-free numbers with an ANI fail more easily.

Inspite of the fact that AT&T and Bellsouth has learned it's lesson, there are still many telephone
companies that have not. Telus is one of these companies, and not only do they allow you to spoof ANI,
but they allow you to spoof Caller ID too. Telus' toll-free "dial-around" is 800-646-000, by simply
calling this number with an ANI-fail you can give the operator any number as where you are calling
from. Telus is odd, in that they keep upgrading and downgrading there dial-around call center, you
used to be able to call any toll-free number through the Telus operator and it would pass whatever
number you gave the operator as ANI to the toll-free number you called, now it apears that they have
new toll-free trunks that only pass ANI-fails to toll-free numbers, and you can not call MCI owned
toll-free numbers for some reason either. Never-the-less, the ANI is still passed when you call a long
distance number through Telus dial-around service and the ANI is also used as Caller ID So by simply
causing an ANI-fail to Telus dial-around service you can spoof Caller ID to anyone you want to call,
not only that if the person you are calling is in the same area as the number you are spoofing, the
NAME and number shows up on the caller ID display. To demonstrate this I will cause an ANI fail to
Telus dial-around using AT&T's 10-10-288-0 and then calling 800-646-0000, I will then place a collect
call to this phone from a spoofed number, I will use xxx-xxx-xxxx as an example and you will see the
name and number show up on the screen. Now I know you're thinking yea that's great, but can you only
use it to spoof caller ID on collect calls? NO, you can social engineer the telus operator to place
"test calls" for you which is a free call w/ no billing, however I'm not sure if that is considered
toll fraud or not so I will not be demonstrating that. Telus is not the only telephone company that
has this type of dial-around system, AT&T as stated used this in the past though they didn't use
spoofed ANI as Caller ID, and there are a few other phone companies out there besides Telus that you
can also use this trick on. The sad thing is that ANI spoofing and Caller ID spoofing is so easy, yet
many companies use ANI and Caller ID as a security feature, for example I got a credit card in the
mail once that the only verification you needed to activate it was to call from your "home phone".
It didn't ask for the last 4 of my SSN or anything else, had the card been mis-delivered to my neigh-
bor or I accidently through it away anyone could have easily spoofed ANI and activated the card with-
out me knowing it. Hopefully this presentation will make everyone more aware that ANI and Caller ID
should not be relied on as where you are really calling from.

-- What you saw at H2K2 when it said "Lucky225 Rules" was spoofing by emulating bell 202 FSK signals,
near the end of the panel was me social engineering the Telus operator telling her I was calling from
909-661-2600 and having her place a call to the phone next to me, the reason it didn't work the first
time is because I tried to make it quick and just have her call the phone collect but the lines had a
collect block, so then I tried telling her I'm a tech and the call went through and the caller ID was
spoofed but the line I was calling didn't have the Caller ID projector hooked up to it, so I finally
switched phones and did a final social engineer through telus to call the phone that had the Caller ID
projector hooked up and thats when you saw "California 909-661-2600" flash up on the screen. Spoofing
Caller ID through Telus still works, but social engineering them to get a free call is most likely harder
now that I have told you all how to do it during the speach, but if you happen to have 2 phone lines and
one of them doesn't have a collect block you can call the one next to you collect through the Telus oper-
ator(op divert to her first and give her the # you wish to spoof as where you are calling from).

Spoonm's Open Source software wrote in perl, also has a web based cgi that allows you to create and
download a wav file w/ the spoofed info you want.

Hello,

Last night (July 27th) starting at about 4am, the Rogers AT&T Pay As You Go
vulnerability was once again in effect. Calls were getting no "you have blah
blah blah minutes available for this call" prompts in Saskatchewan and BC.
I don't know about other provinces. All calls to anywhere in the world were
going through for free up until 115pm. Then they seemed to be working on it,
calls were getting prompts again unfortunately. Then at 210pm they were going
through for free again until around 6pm. One thing I also noticed is that during
the time they fixed it, I used minutes, then it went to free again, they fixed it
again, and I had the minutes I used during that time BACK! Anyway just wondering
if you guys noticed this where you are. I got my worth from it.

Hi im colt45 from Hackers.com and Hackers Unlimited Organization.  Im
obviously on your mailing list and i have a little tidbit of info for you.
I dont know if you can use it but if you do that would be great.  I live in
brockville ontario.  I have an ANI for my area and a unversal ANI/ringback
number supposed to be for use anywhere in canada.

The ANI=958-2622
ANI/ringback=1-888-837-8274
if you have call display the number that rings you back is:
1-416-981-0001.

I hope you can use this info for the next K-1ine  issue.
Could you please email me back and tell me if its of use to you OR not.
Either way, i would like to know.  Well keep up the good work and i look
forward to reading #30.


FROM COLT45, THE SMOKING GUN!
