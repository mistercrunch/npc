News: FTAA Protest - Edmonton
-----------------------------

(taken from: http://disc.server.com/discussion.cgi?id=150061&article=238)

 I went to it. The protest marched on from Whyte Ave all the way
  across the bridge to the other side. We all had a seat on the grass
  right across from the ledge'. About 200 or so people showed up, we
  had speakers from various groups in our community, music, and a
  play. All in all, it was pretty damn successful. Never have I felt
  such unity from fellow Edmontonians. Well done!
    
  Oh, and I spoke with one of the people involved in the P.A.N
  organization. She was taking down names and number of people who
  want to be contacted about further protests. I gave her my name and
  #, as well I explained that Hack Canada has linked to their site,
  to help bring awareness to the march. I'll of course keep you all
  posted on further protests in the future. 

   Regards, Clone

        K-L1NE COVERUP SCANDAL
                                        wizbone - 23/03/01

     The WNN recieved reports earlier today which point to a scandalous
coverup by The Clone, editor in chief of k-l1ne magazine, a 'zine' which
covers articles about computer hacking, phone fraud, and security in many
areas.  The Clone aka Rebecca Fitzgerald is a member of the hacker
organization named "HackCanada".  The Clone also maintains several
security-related websites such as nettwerked.net, and fonetrap.com.
     Up until the time this report was released, The Clone has always
managed to keep himself respectable with a clean record, providing good
information to all.
     Today it was uncovered that in the latest issue of k-l1ne 13, The
Clone decided to use the exact ASCII art at the top of the articles which
he used in the previous issue #12. Upon further investigation, WNN's
own field investigator Wizbone uncovered some startling discoveries. The
Clone had neglected to change the "12" to a "13", which wouldn't be so bad
if not for the fact that upon notifying The Clone of his error, he
immediately changed the ascii to reflect the intended number.
     "You can't just go changing released documents like this," said
chairman of WNN, wizbone, "people have a right to know when a mistake has
been made."
     The Clone declined comment to comment on the issue, though when
confronted with the issue, he called WNN news correspondent Wizbone a
"funny head" and proceeded to make funny ASCII emoticons. Before
communication ended, he did say "happy sad".
     This leaves many asking, is Clone going off the deep end?
     At first glance, one would say undoubtedly, "no." However, upon
glancing further, and squinting one's eyes, one might change their mind.
     It seems this isn't the first information coverup The Clone has
faced. Back around fall 2000, The Clone posted a text file on his website
which claimed to contain the frequencies needed for a device called a
"Green Box". This device is alleged to allow one to recieve money from a
payphone upon playing the tones into it.
     As it turns out, the tones contained within the file were no more
than a simple tune, played by many popular answering machines while they
advance their tapes to record a message.
     Upon discovering this through the help of HackCanada webmaster
cyb0rg/asm, he promptly removed the file and to this day denies all
previous existence of it.
     cyb0rg/asm was not available for comment though his secretary staff
released a statement which noted that cyb0rg/asm was not involved with any
part of the information coverup, he simply pointed out The Clone's error.
     So it seems The Clone has had a rather shady past as far as coverups
and the hiding of information goes. This reporter would guess there may be
other skeletons Clone keeps locked away from the world's eyes. WNN
intends, as always, to expose the truth and will continue to do so.
     Rebecca Fitzgerald, the world is watching you a little closer now,
the truth will come out.

PROGRAMMABLE BLACK HOLE COMPUTERS. One usually thinks of a black hole as an
omnivorous object swallowing energy and spitting some of it back in the form
of Hawking evaporation radiation, consisting of particles created in pairs
out of the vacuum near the edge of the black hole. In principle, a tiny
black hole can be formed in a way that encodes instructions for performing
calculations. Correspondingly, the answers could be read out from the
escaping Hawking radiation. Why use a black hole at all? Because of the
presumed tremendous density of information and potential processing speed
implicit in the extreme black hole environment. Seth Lloyd of MIT has
previously addressed himself to calculating the conceivable limits on the
computing power of such a black hole computer (Nature, 31 August 2000) and
arrives at a maximum processing speed of about 10^51 operations/sec for a
1-kg black hole. Now Jack Ng of the University of North Carolina
yjng@physics.unc.edu, 919-962-7208) extends this study by asking whether the
very foaminess of spacetime, thought to arise at the level of 10^-35 m,
provides an alternative way to limit theoretical computation. Ng not only
finds that it does but that the foaminess of spacetime leads to an
uncertainty in timekeeping (the more accurate the clock, the shorter its
lifetime) which in turn leads to a bound on information processing (speed
and memory simultaneously) analogous to the Heisenberg bound on simultaneous
measurement of momentum and position. These limits are so generous that they
normally pose little problem for ordinary physical measurements, but in the
case of black hole computer the limits would apply immediately. Ng adds,
apropos of detecting gravity waves with LIGO and other interferometric
devices, that in addition to accounting for various forms of noise, such as
seismic disturbances or thermal noise in the detectors, the faint gurgle of
spacetime foam will eventually have to be included as an additional and
unavoidable source of noise in the measurement of very short displacements
(the movement of mirrors owing to the flexings of spacetime brought about by
passing gravity waves). If Ng is right, the noise sensitivity achievable by
the prospective advanced phase of LIGO will only need a further hundredfold
enhancement in order to detect the quantum foam, which is to say the very
fabric of spacetime. Thus the Planck scale, so far only a hypothetical
extreme regime, might eventually become a realm that can be approached and
measured. (Physical Review Letters, 2 April 2001.)

The Robot With the Mind of an Eel

By Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, April 17, 2001; Page A01 

CHICAGO -- The cyborg aims for the light and wheels forward. Another light
flashes and the cyborg turns. Again and again, like a bull in a ring, the
cyborg charges, sometimes veering right, sometimes left, sometimes moving
straight ahead, always looking for the light.

The cyborg is no RoboCop, but it is a revolutionary experiment in combining
a mechanical device with living tissue. The robot is controlled by an
immature lamprey eel brain that was removed, kept alive in a special
solution and attached to the hockey-puck-sized robot by wires so it can
receive signals from the device's electronic eyes and send commands to move
the machine's wheels.

"Until the recent past, people were using biological nervous systems to
inspire technology," said physiologist Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern
University's Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. "Now we've gone one step
beyond, to tap into the nervous system itself."

Mussa-Ivaldi's lamprey larvae are one of a large number of creatures whose
supple sensory resources are being put to work in a new generation of
animal/machine hybrids. 

Mussa-Ivaldi is testing the lamprey brain's ability to control a robot, but
the long-term possibilities could be much more spectacular: learning more
about how brains work so electronic microprocessors can be developed to help
compensate for damage from strokes and other types of nerve trauma.

A wide variety of other similar experiments are unfolding in labs across the
country, where rapid advances in electronics and other fields have enabled
scientists to integrate animals and microelectronics. These experiments
envision a range of applications -- using bacteria attached to computer
chips to map pollutants, insects as part of sensors to detect land mines,
chemical weapons and narcotics, and rodent brains to help identify new
medicines.

"There's a couple of things making this happen," said electrical engineer
Michael Simpson of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. "Even before the
mapping of the human genome was completed, there was an explosion in our
understanding of genomics and neural pathways in other animals.

"At the same time, [microelectronic] devices keep getting smaller and
denser," Simpson added. "Single chips are beginning to get complex enough so
that they can begin to work with biological systems."

In Tennessee, Simpson and colleague Gary Sayler have genetically engineered
bacteria to glow in the presence of chemical agents and affixed them to
microchips. The Rockville, Md.-based company Dynamac is licensing their
"critters on a chip" for applications that could include highlighting the
boundaries of toxic waste plumes, monitoring air quality or analyzing body
fluids to test for signs of disease.

In Iowa, entomologist Tom Baker has built a device for finding land mines
using tiny moth antennae that emit signals to microprocessors, which
transform them into different tones. The signals drop in pitch when the
antennae encounter the odor of high explosives used in mines or unexploded
ordnance.

In Los Angeles, neuroscientist Michel Baudry is using brain slices from mice
and rabbits to develop a system for warning soldiers about the presence of
chemical or biological weapons. The system creates an electronic blueprint
for a normal environment, so that when the balance is upset, an alarm will
tell soldiers to don gas masks.

Formidable barriers remain before scientists will fully benefit from critter
science. Animals must be trained and maintained. Shelf life of natural
tissue is a problem.

And so is size. University of Montana entomologist Jerry Bromenshenk has
trained bees to find explosives, and the Agricultural Research Service's Joe
Lewis has done the same in Georgia with parasitic wasps, but there is not
yet a practical method for tracking such tiny sentinels when they are flying
free.

And at Iowa State University in Ames, Baker can read the reactions of his
moth antennae on an oscilloscope, but he doesn't yet have the electronics
that a soldier needs to discriminate between the signal he wants and other
odor sources.

Using animals to serve humankind is as old as training falcons to hunt and
dogs to fetch. The impulse is always to take advantage of animals' superior
qualities, and if scientists couldn't use the animals themselves, they have
tried -- and often failed -- to make devices that mimic their expertise.

Harold Hawkins, head of the Office of Naval Research's bioacoustics program,
notes that a dolphin can map the sea bottom in its mind's eye with "one, or
two, or three" pings from its echo-location system, while the world's
fanciest side-scan sonar needs dozens of slow passes to build the same
picture.

Other animals are just as sophisticated, but science is catching up: "We are
getting the engineering tools that allow us to plug into living systems,"
said Alan Rudolph of the federal government's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, which has funded a number of critter projects. "We are
asking the question, 'Can we make machines with living components and make
them work?' "

Mussa-Ivaldi's experiments in "biology as technology" brought him and
colleague Simon Alford to the lamprey because it is a well-studied creature
with very large nerve cells and a brain stem that can survive for several
days in an oxygenated and refrigerated salt solution.

Using a microscope, Mussa-Ivaldi or his colleagues extract brain stems from
the squiggly, pencil-thin, 6-inch-long lamprey larvae under anesthetic. They
put the half-inch-long brain stem on a stand, connect electrodes to both
sides of it, and run wires to each side of the robot, an off-the-shelf
miniature from Switzerland called a Khepera. The robot is placed in the
center of a circular arena about 3 1/2 feet in diameter -- like a tiny bull
ring.

As lights mounted at 45-degree intervals flash on and off around the pit's
rim, the robot's light sensors send signals to microprocessors that
transform them into impulses the lamprey brain can interpret. The brain
sends signals back through another set of microprocessors, which produce the
electric impulses that drive the wheels. When the lights don't flash, the
robot doesn't move.

The lamprey ordinarily uses this mechanism for balance -- to keep itself
centered and upright in the water. As a result, the animal's brain will seek
equilibrium, and, indeed, in most cases the robot will turn to the light and
run toward it.

But if assistant Karen Fleming masks one of the eyes, the robot will first
travel in circles, since only one side of the brain receives signals -- "but
we hope it will compensate," and straighten out. It usually does, after a
few practice runs.

The effect is eerie, for it is clear that the brain senses the light. In
darkness, an oscilloscope picture is stationary, but when a light flashes,
the display spikes dramatically and the robot's wheels begin to turn.

"As you see it here," said Mussa-Ivaldi, watching the robot scoot across the
pit, "the lamprey brain is the only thing that makes it move." While the
team appears to have established that the brain can learn, Mussa-Ivaldi
said, it has not yet been able to keep brain function stable long enough to
test its memory. Mussa-Ivaldi is optimistic that whatever he learns will
eventually help researchers develop high-tech prostheses for stroke victims
and others who suffer nerve damage.

Training unusual animals to serve human ends has proved surprisingly easy,
in part because of the extensive research that scientists have done simply
to find out why they do what they do.

In Tifton, Ga., the Department of Agriculture's Lewis and several colleagues
had studied parasitic wasps for 30 years as a way to kill caterpillars in
farm crops before Rudolph's DARPA funded him to see if he could transform
his charges into sensors.

Lewis knew the wasp responded to smells it identified with food and with
reproduction. By feeding the wasps sugar water as he exposed them to the
odor of di-nitro toluene, an explosive akin to dynamite, he was able to
teach the insects to seek di-nitro toluene in the field. In Montana,
Bromenshenk has done the same thing with bees, also a DARPA project.

But having trained his "miniature bloodhounds," Bromenshenk had to be able
to track them electronically. Radio transmitters were too heavy, and
although scientists had had some success gluing microchips on the bees, the
process took too long. Bromenshenk is waiting for someone to produce a
"spray-on" chip.

In Georgia, Lewis has patented a hand-held "biosensor," and puts his
wasps -- much smaller than the bees -- inside. When the insects smell an
odor, they duck their heads to receive the reward, tripping an electric eye.
Lewis said such a device could work well searching for explosives at
airports, cocaine at the border, or even traces of disease in odors from the
human body.

Baker's experiment with moth antennae, also funded by DARPA, may offer a
solution to the size dilemma, for it uses only tissue from the insect,
rather than the whole animal, and mounts the detector in a vehicle.

Moths use their antennae to detect different odors. Baker attaches
electrodes to the base of the antennae to try to develop an olfactory
"signature" for any odor he seeks, including high explosives. The eventual
goal is to put the antennae in a mobile cyborg that can both sense a land
mine and flag the target.

The system now works with a remote-controlled vehicle, Baker said, but a
trained researcher has to walk beside it to listen for the tonal patterns
that signal "hits," and find their source by assessing the wind direction.

In the insect experiments, researchers are trying to pick one odor from a
barrage of competing signals, but in Los Angeles, the University of Southern
California's Baudry has reversed the approach by modeling hundreds of
thousands of signals that describe a normal environment. When something
doesn't fit -- a biological agent or a toxic pesticide -- a warning alarm
sounds.

Baudry does this using slices from the hippocampus of a rabbit or mouse, a
section of the brain that forms new, long-term memory -- in humans, for
example, it links a face with a name.

The sophistication of the mammalian brain, coupled with modern computer
capacity, has given this research almost unlimited potential, for once
scientists assemble a library of responses, they can screen for practically
anything, including testing thousands of chemicals to see if one might
produce a novel medicine.

One barrier to the practical exploitation of critter devices is the need to
increase their life span. Baudry said his team has "almost, but not quite,"
developed a way to suspend the slice in a gelatinized nutrient that can be
activated with heat -- extending the shelf life to several weeks or months.

In simpler organisms, this hurdle can be lower. Oak Ridge's Simpson and
Sayler, a University of Tennessee microbiologist, were able to freeze-dry
and encapsulate bacteria so that they would activate when water was added to
the chip.

The Simpson-Sayler "critter on a chip," being marketed by Dynamac as an
environmental biosensor, grew out of Sayler's ability to transplant a
luminescent gene from a marine bacterium into another bacterium that
degrades pollutants.

When the second bacterium ate the pollutant, it glowed, demonstrating that
it was doing its job. If the researchers pasted a bunch of bacteria on a
chip, the microcircuitry could detect the luminescence and send a signal to
a remote display.

By salting a site with bacteria, scientists might map the extent of a toxic
plume. Installed sensors could monitor pollutants at water purification
plants, check air quality on spacecraft or warn of chemical or biological
warfare attacks.

"We're turning the bacteria into microelectronic components to detect
different substances," said Sayler. "You can engineer the organisms to eat
almost anything."

		Mail Server Denial of Service Exploit

by: Ace905

(Also available in HTML format:
 http://www.myhometechie.com/hackz/dos/smtp-exploit.html)

   It seems strange to me to have come up with this idea on my own,
   having never heard of it before. If anyone has any information on this
   being an outdated exploit, then please write in.
   
   Disclaimer: I am not joking when I say, this is really meant as a
   proof of concept tool. I have no interest in seeing any email server
   go down. Please do not use this information to cause damage; just
   remember it next time you configure your network. I am not responsible
   for anything you choose to do, whether it works or not.
   The title of the article pretty much speaks for itself, but here's a
   
   write-up: 
   Let me start by saying, in theory this method should crash email
   servers, in practice however; certain network restrictions and basic
   security will limit the amount of email any one server receives from
   this method. It is possible to write an application to direct a slew
   of auto-responding email servers against each other, but I'm not going
   to code it.
   
   Auto responding email servers are running those servers which reply to
   your message instantaneously, but it is obvious the message has been
   generated by a computer. A good example of this would be Microsofts
   support@microsoft.com server. It is intended to both allow a customer
   to request technical support, and to quell their worries by giving
   them an immediate response stating their email was received. The
   response also directs them to other resources on the internet. Their
   are a lot of email services such as this, and the number is growing as
   people realize the majority of peoples concerns or questions regarding
   their product can be answered with a simple product catalogue or
   contact information.

   When you write to these email addresses, you get an automatic reply.
   After receiving an automatically generated message like this, most
   people generally delete them and forget about them, and wait for tech
   support, or the person they were trying to contact to get back to them
   in person. Not very many people have tried to reply to the message
   they received. Well guess what! Almost every time you reply to one of
   these auto-generated messages, you are replying to the same email
   address. When that happens, you are telling the auto-responder to
   respond again. So what you say? Imagine if two auto-responders were
   automatically responding to each other. Or, imagine one auto-responder
   responding to itself; this would cause an infinite loop of cross-talk,
   filling bandwidth and server space.

   Ok so here's the concept:
   After receiving an email sent as SPAM, a perspective exploiter would
   reply to the message. If the message responds again immediately - from
   the same email address, then the exploiter would know it is an
   auto-responding email server and set to respond to all-incoming mail.
   
   If it responds from a different email address, then the message should
   be replied to again. If eventually it is automatically responding from
   the same email address, then it is still a valid target.
   Exploiting the service can be done easily from both a UNIX or Windows
   environment, making the concept open to a very broad range of
   malicious computer users. The steps taken to cause a denial of service
   are outlined below.
   Two methods are listed below for exploiting this, the first is much
   more interesting but not guaranteed to work, the second is much easier
   and causes 2 victims.
   
   Method 1
   This method at first glance would appear to the network administrator
   as a glitch in their software. The server would be constantly emailing
   itself and almost every message would be the same message they
   originally programmed the server to respond with.
   Under windows, a malicious cracker would save their auto-generated
   email as a .TXT file and open it in windows notepad.
   Messages appear in this format:

   Return-Path: x_vxxxxx@DOMAIN.com
   Received: from xxxxx03.mail.yahoo.com ([222.222.222.22]) by 
   tomts9-srv.bellnexxia.net (InterMail vM.4.01.03.00 201-229-121) with

   Subject: Auto Reply To: your_email@YOURdomain.com
   Cc: MIME-Version: 1.0
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
   
   This is an auto generated message for your_email@YOURdomain.com.
   Remember SMTP is the program / protocol to send mail and POP is the
   program / protocol to receive mail. A Program like Outlook Express, or
   any email program is actually using the SMTP and POP protocols to
   communicate with a mail server. Notice after "Received:" the email was
   sent using SMTP or ESMTP.
   
   A cracker would then connect to the companies own SMTP server and make
   it look as if the comany is sending an email message as themselves, to
   themselves. In actuality this is very to perform. SMTP stands for
   "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol" and since its inception, it was meant
   to be used by hand. That is, sending email was never meant to require
   a program such as outlook express, so this standard protocol can be
   used and manipulated to send a number of messages in a number of ways.

   It is also possible to hand-specify the originators email address.
   A very good TCP/IP connections program is called "NetCat". It is good
   for both Unix environments and Windows.
   C:\Netcat\>
   this is the dos command prompt, where Netcat is installed.

   C:\Netcat\>nc -v -v -o mylogfile.txt smtp1.victimsdomain.com 25

   This line says, "run netcat double verbose so I can see what's
   happening, make a file of all the information I send and receive
   called mylogfile.txt and connect to the send-mail server of the victim
   on port 25. Keep in mind, the send-mail server was listed in the email
   which would have already been received, other common names for the
   server are smtp2.victimsdomain.com, (smtpX.victimsdomain.com),
   mail01.victimsdomain.com , mail.victimsdomain.com. But it's listed in
   the auto-generated email which has already been analyzed.
   After connecting to the victims mail server, this dialogue appears
   smtp1.victimsdomain.com [222.222.222.22] 25 (smtp) open
   220 tomts5.bellnexxia.net ESMTP server

   To start the message, 
   >> MAIL FROM: victim@victimsdomain.com

   (it appears the server finds that mailbox to be ok, note how the
   sender and receiver are the same)
   >>RCPT TO: victim@victimsdomain.com

   (it appears the server finds that mailbox to be ok too!, writing the

   >>^.^
   250 Message received:

   At this point, the auto responder should see a message on the server,
   and use POP to receive it. It will then read that it is from itself
   and use SMTP to reply to itself. It will then see there is another
   message on the server for itself... and continue until a number of
   things go wrong. It may crash after it fills its own hard drive, it
   may stop after reaching a limit on the number of messages it sends to
   any email address, or it may keep sending messages and stop all other                     Anonymous, Chadder, Jim Bell,
   email services while it is stuck.

   Method 2
   Using free, and anonymous email services such as a Hotmail account, a
   cracker would use a search engine such as Google.com and search for
   "mailing list sign up". Then they would check every web site that
   comes up to see if they have a sign up for a mailing list. If the sign
   up is an HTML form (ie: you just put in your email address without
   running an email program such as Outlook Express), then they would
   submit their new Hotmail account email address. Checking their own
   email account regularly, and replying to every email received would
   quickly narrow the list down to auto-responders, and 1-time
   responders. Eventually, the cracker would find a slew of email
   addresses which consistantly reply to them.

   If this is the case, exploiting the error is as simple as going to the
   website the emails were from and instead of giving out a hotmail
   account email address, they would simply type the email address of the
   first auto-responding server they wished to exploit.
   In theory, these two servers should keep emailing each other back and
   forth.

   Variations on this method are also possible, the cracker could try
   searching through features of various message boards or online
   services. A lot of them allow users to create an account with no
   actual identification, and they have auto-reply functions in some of
   their server's email addresses too. In scenarious where connecting to
   the original mail server by hand are complicated, it is possible a
   cracker could connect to other auto-responders using their smtp
   server, and send an email as the original server.

Quantum Reality

What is reality? What is truth? What is real, fake? How can we deem others wrong, and 
ourselves right?

First, what is reality, reality is merely what the most people think. If I'm in a room of 
blind people, colors are not real. If I am in a room of people that say 2+2 is 5, 2+2 is then, 
5. The only way we can convince others, or ourselves, is by asking other people, and 
seeing what they think. 

Studies have been done, where a person has been stuck in a room given a simple math 
problem, and been instructed to complete the problem and share answers with 9 others. 
The 9 others were told to all give false answers, eventually, the one person with the right 
answer succumbs to the pressure.

What does this tell us? That everything in the entire world is based on our perceptions. 
Therefore, since many people see/smell/taste/touch/think different things, we have no 
way to tell whether something is 'real', as our perceptions could be corrupted. Thus, 
nothing is ever truly real, or truly false. Nothing can be proven to be real, or false, as our 
data has a chance of being wrong, and a chance of being right. All we can do is see what 
the majority thinks, and come to the conclusion that whatever the most people say they 
see or think, is what is most likely to be true, and thus will be considered true.

Everyone in the world at one point believed the world was flat. This is of course, no 
longer the popular belief, and is thus not real. 500 yrs. from now, we too could be 
mocked for our shortsightedness, at how we believed the center of the earth, whatever the 
hell current belief is.

What I am getting to, is that it is egotistical and na∩ve, though completely natural, to hold 
ones beliefs above another's.

And thus, every decision, every fact, every, everything, is a mere probability, and could 
be, entirely untrue, or true. Carrying on with the reference to the sciences in the title, true 
reality, is as impossible to reach as absolute zero. And the next time you see someone 
hauled away to the sanitarium, have a chuckle, as there is a chance, no matter how 
unlikely, that whatever he sees, could be that true reality.

Computing, One Atom at a Time

March 27, 2001

By GEORGE JOHNSON

    OS ALAMOS, N.M. ù The only hint that anything extraordinary is happening
inside the brown
    stucco building at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a small metal sign
posted in front: "Warning!
Magnetic Field in Use. Remain on Sidewalk." Come much closer and you risk
having the magnetic
stripes on your credit cards erased.

The powerful field is emanating from the supercooled superconducting magnets
inside a tanklike
machine called a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer.

The device itself is unremarkable. N.M.R. machines are used in chemistry
labs across the world to
map the architecture of molecules by sensing how their atoms dance to the
beat of electromagnetic
waves. Hospitals and clinics use the same technology, called magnetic
resonance imaging, or M.R.I., to
scan the tissues of the human body.

The machine at Los Alamos has been enlisted on a recent morning for a
grander purpose: to carry out
an experiment in quantum computing. By using radio waves to manipulate atoms
like so many quantum
abacus beads, the Los Alamos scientists will coax a molecule called crotonic
acid into executing a
simple computer program.

Last year they set a record, carrying out a calculation involving seven
atoms. This year they are
shooting for 10. That may not sound like many.

Each atom can be thought of as a little switch, a register that holds a 1 or
a 0, and the latest Pentium
chip contains 42 million such devices. But the paradoxical laws of quantum
mechanics confer a
powerful advantage: a single atom can do two calculations at once. Two atoms
can do four, three
atoms can do eight.

By the time you reach 10, doubling and doubling and doubling along the way,
you have an invisibly tiny
computer that can carry out 1,024 (210) calculations at the same time.

If scientists can find ways to leverage this achievement to embrace 20
atoms, they will be able to
execute a million simultaneous calculations. Double that again to 40 atoms,
and 10 trillion calculations
can be done in tandem.

The goal, still but a distant glimmer, is to harness thousands of atoms,
resulting in a machine so
powerful that it would easily break codes now considered impenetrable and
solve other problems that
are impossible for even the fastest supercomputer.

"We are at the border of a new territory," said Dr. Raymond Laflamme, one of
the leaders of the Los
Alamos project. "All the experiments today are a very small step, but they
show that there is not a
wall."

"The big question," he added, "is whether we can make the transition from
theory to practice."

The program that he and a colleague, Dr. Emanuel Knill, are now running ù a
procedure for detecting
and correcting the errors that inevitably crop up during the exceedingly
delicate quantum calculations
ù is being watched with interest by other theorists.

"Quantum error correction is vitally important for future quantum
technologies," said Dr. John Preskill,
a physicist at the California Institute of Technology. "Until the idea of
quantum error correction was
discovered in 1995, there was great skepticism about whether large- scale
quantum computers
capable of outperforming conventional digital computers would ever be
practical."

Now Dr. Knill and Dr. Laflamme are demonstrating that what was shown to be
true in theory works in
practice as well. Their experiment is also a landmark in another way.

Researchers have recently used N.M.R. to get molecules to execute
rudimentary programs, like
searching a database using fewer steps than required by an ordinary
computer. (As a sign of how
primitive the technology remains, the database consisted of a list of only
eight numbers.) Dr. Knill and
Dr. Laflamme's error-correcting algorithm is still quite simple, compared
with, say, Microsoft Word,
but it is one of the most complex pieces of quantum software yet run.

Less than a decade ago, quantum computing was just an intellectual parlor
game, a way for theorists to
test their mettle by imagining absurdly small computers with parts the size
of individual atoms. At its
root, computation is just a matter of shuffling bits, the 1's and 0's of
binary arithmetic. So suppose an
atom pointing up means 1 and an atom pointing down means 0. Flip around
these bits by zapping the
atoms with laser beams or radio waves and the result is an extremely tiny
computer.

But that would be just the beginning of its power. Quantum mechanics, the
rules governing subatomic
particles, dictates that these quantum bits, called qubits (pronounced
KYEW-bits), can also be in a
"superposition," indicating 1 and 0 at the same time. Two atoms can
simultaneously be in four states:
00, 01, 10 and 11. Three atoms can say eight things at once: 000, 001, 010,
011, 100, 101, 110 and
111. For each atom added to the chain, the number of possibilities increases
exponentially, by a power
of 2. Put together a few dozen atoms, it seemed, and they could perform vast
numbers of calculations
simultaneously.

All this was of little more than academic interest until 1994, when Dr.
Peter Shor, a researcher at
AT&T Laboratories in Florham Park, N.J., proved that a quantum computer
could rapidly find the
factors of long numbers, a problem that flummoxes human brains and
supercomputers. Since the codes
that are used to protect military and financial secrets depend on the near
impossibility of this task,
government money began pouring into places like Los Alamos, allowing
theorists like Dr. Laflamme
and Dr. Knill to begin turning the thought experiments into reality.

"There is no fundamental physical barrier that makes quantum computing
impossible," Dr. Knill said.
"The technology, as it exists, is a long way from meeting the goal. But we
see no reason in principle
why the goal cannot be met."

For the past few years, laboratories have been using exotic technologies to
isolate small numbers of
atoms, prodding them into performing simple calculations. Dr. Laflamme and
Dr. Knill's group is
among those that have been trying a different method: using the off-the-
shelf technology of N.M.R., in
which molecules ù strings of atoms ù are trapped in intense magnetic fields
and manipulated with
radio waves.

This approach is possible because the cores of some atoms ù the nuclei ù are
endowed with a
quality called spin. They act like little tops, rotating in the presence of
a magnetic field. If the nucleus is
rotating counterclockwise, its axis of spin points upward. Flip it over and
it rotates clockwise, a
condition called downward spin.

Nudging these nuclei with pulses of high-frequency radio waves causes them
to shift between the two
positions, up and down. And since the molecules emit feeble electromagnetic
signals, the progress of
the experiment can be monitored on a computer screen.

This technique is a proven tool for chemists, who use N.M.R. to generate
charts called spectra that
give clues to the structure of chemical compounds. Several years ago,
scientists at Stanford, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the I.B.M. Almaden Research Center,
the University of Oxford
and elsewhere realized that N.M.R. could be used for a very different
purpose. Call up "1" and down
"0" and you have a tiny molecular switch.

As Dr. Laflamme put it: "People had been doing quantum computing all along.
They just didn't know
it."

During the recent experiment, he and Dr. Knill sat in front of a computer
workstation that was wired
and programmed to control the N.M.R. machine. Their goal: to get a string of
five nuclei to carry out
their error- correcting algorithm.

Errors occur when a bit is accidentally flipped so that it says 1 when it
really means 0, or vice versa.
Ordinary computers can protect against this by using redundancy. In one
scheme, data are sent in
triplicate, so 101 becomes 111000111. Simple little programs watch out for
corrupted triplets like 010
or 110, restoring the errant bits so they match the other two.

For quantum computing, error correction is more convoluted. A qubit is
protected by using an intricate
scheme that effectively spreads its value across a cluster of five qubits
that are all "entangled" quantum
mechanically. That means that if one of the qubits becomes scrambled, its
original value can be
retrieved by analyzing the other four.

In the experiment, the five qubits will be represented by the nuclei of five
atoms in a molecule of
crotonic acid. Schematically this can be thought of as a string of five
beads, though the arrangement is
slightly more complex. Four of the beads are carbon nuclei ù or actually
isotopes called carbon 13.
(Since ordinary carbon 12 is spinless, the physicists called on a Los Alamos
chemist, Dr. Rudy
Martinez, to synthesize crotonic acid using carbon 13.) The other bead on
the string actually consists of
a cluster of three hydrogen nuclei, part of a structure called a methyl
group, that is treated as a single
processor.

In the scientists' notebooks, the five-qubit sequence is abbreviated like
this: M C1 C2 C3 C4 ù a
methyl followed by four carbons. These are the tokens that will be used to
compute. As the calculation
unfolds, the tiny signals emitted by the molecules will be monitored and
displayed by the computer as a
horizontal zigzag line.

First a small flask of crotonic acid containing about 1021 (a billion
trillion) of the molecules is placed
inside the core of the N.M.R. spectrometer. A bath of liquid nitrogen and
liquid helium cools the
machine's superconducting coils, allowing electricity to course through them
unimpeded, generating the
intense magnetic field that the sign outside warns about.

Tapping on the keyboard, Dr. Knill "shims" the magnets ù straightening out
the kinks in the
electromagnetic field. The effect is not unlike what happens when a
carpenter uses little wooden
wedges to shim a window frame so it is perfectly horizontal.

After the machine is calibrated the experiment can begin. At first, the
nuclei in the molecules are
pointing every which way, creating a predominantly random soup. But the
strong magnetic field causes
a fraction of the molecules, about one in a 100,000,000, to line up so that
all their nuclei are pointing
up: 11111.

This subset of uniformly aligned molecules ù about 10 trillion of them ù
will be used to carry out the
computation. This is possible because the five nuclei within the molecules
each resonate at a different
frequency. Using pulses of radio waves, an operator sitting at the controls
of an N.M.R. machine can
choose an individual nucleus ù carbon number 2, for example ù and strike it
like a bell. Throughout
the flask, trillions of C2 nuclei will chime in synchrony.

Apply the pulse for just the right duration and the C2's can be rotated to
point down for 0. Another
pulse will cause them to point to 1 again. And a pulse of half the duration
will cause them to hover in
quantum superposition, potentially saying 1 and 0 at the same time.

What has been described so far is just the quantum version of a light
switch. The reason a molecule can
be used to calculate is that its nuclei, like the tiny switches inside a
computer chip, interact with one
another: a radio pulse will cause a certain nucleus to change from 1 to 0 ù
but only if the nucleus to its
left is 1. In an ordinary computer these kinds of arrangements are called
logic gates, the building blocks
of computation. String enough of them together and any calculation can be
performed.

Dr. Knill starts the quantum algorithm by directing the machine to emit a
short burst of pulses. This
causes the first carbon nucleus, C1, to point down while the other four
qubits remain up. Throughout
the soup, trillions of molecules now say 10111, a pattern that can be
displayed on the computer screen
as a horizontal line with a peak ù the spectrum. A single qubit of quantum
information has been
stored.

Another series of pulses then protects this information by encoding it among
the cluster of qubits,
flipping them up or down according to the rules of the correction algorithm.

Then an error is deliberately introduced. A radio pulse is used to flip one
of the qubits ù just as might
accidentally happen during a computation. But the original message has not
been lost. A final barrage
of pulses is unleashed, which analyzes the cluster, ferrets out the error
and fixes the mistake. On the
computer screen the peak of the spectrum shifts, showing that the experiment
has been a success.

There are no whoops of joy or uncorking of Champagne. Since last fall, the
experiment has been
repeated many times. But it is always satisfying for the theorists to see
that it really works.
