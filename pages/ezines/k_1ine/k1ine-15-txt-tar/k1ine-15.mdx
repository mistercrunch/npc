		     News: Nettwerked CD

[Tue May 8 21:43]

I just wanted to fill you all in on what is happening with the
Nettwerked CDs (www.nettwerked.net/cd.html) that Cenobyte, DWR, 
and I are working our butts off to finish for sale at Def Con 9.
     
As it stands, we will not be featuring any mainstream artists in
the cd without their express written permission (Cenobyte is working
on getting our stuff to 'Orbital' for permission to use 'Halcyon & On & On'
for our opening song). DWR and I however have finished off two down-tempo/
experimental tracks for the cd's; "The Sine Wave Experiment" and "Funk".
We plan on writing more songs in the future (using 'FruityLoops') ...
maybe some hard-trance stuff... and more experimental/downtempo (we love
that shit).

Now, if you make music on your computer (we prefer if it's electronic;
ie. trance, ambient, experimental, jungle, drum & bass, hardhouse, hardcore,
dub, etc) and would like to see your masterpiece(s) on the Nettwerked cd,
please contact either me (The Clone): theclone@ecn.ab.ca and/or Cenobyte:
jkodish@ecn.ab.ca.

WNN Exclusive
04/24/01

As always, WNN's dedicated effort to expose the truth has once again
turned up some secrets. This time is seems our friends The Clone, editor
in chief of k-line magazine and webmaster of security sites such as
nettwerked.net and trapfone.com has more secrets.

As it turns out, The Clone, aka Rebecca Fitzgerald, sleeps with a pink
teddy bear. Yes, it's true. He, a grown man, and seemingly level-headed
individual sleeps with a pink, stuffed teddy bear purchased from Zellers.

He affectionately calls his child's plaything "Muffy" and has been said to
cry quite violently when it's removed from his bedroom.

WNN staff discovered this while investigating his living premises while he
was at work. As yet, WNN hasn't been able to find out just where The
Clone's place of employment is. A hidden camera was placed in Clone's
bedroom and the teddy removed. The following is an ascii conversion of
what the camera picked up when The Clone returned home to find his beloved
"Muffy" not on the silk pillow where he leaves it every morning.

 
____________
\  #######  \                  /0\
 \  pillow   \                 \|/
  \  #######  \                 |  The Clone
   \           \               /`\
    \  bed      \            _|   \_
     \___________\


As you can see from the shocked look on The Clone's face, he was quite
distraught by the whole situation. Moments later, the camera caught Clone
crying furiously and banging his fists on the wall. WNN officials parked
in a white van outside, watching the ordeal eventually felt sorry for The
Clone and left the bear on his doorstep, rang the doorbell, and gracefully
ran away.

Sensitive young man, or derranged teddy-loving psychopath? You decide.

                           MOUNTING INSTRUCTIONS

                    Mounting the Backboard or Enclosure  


	OUTDOOR INSTALLATION

   If the payphone is to be installed outdoors, you must use an outdoor
   pedestal / enclosure to mount the payphone and to prevent weather
   deterioration. Outdoor pedestals can be mounted using concrete
   anchors. Outdoor wall-peds can be mounted using toggle bolts. The
   telephone cable should be routed to the pedestal using EMT conduit.
   Once the pedestal & enclosure is mounted, follow the instructions
   in this guide to mount the payphone to the pedestal & enclosure.


        INDOOR INSTALLATION

   It is recommended to use ╝" Toggle Bolts (with washers) to secure
   the backboard or enclosure to the wall. The length of the toggle bolt
   depends on the thickness of the wall. Anchor Screws may be used as an
   alternative to Toggle Bolts.

   1. Ensure that the wall that the backboard or enclosure is to install
      to is flat & level.

   2. The top height of the backboard or enclosure should be determined
      by the following:

    - Standard Height = 63" from floor

    - Wheelchair Accessible = 54" from floor

   3. Place the backboard or enclosure against the wall at the desired
      height & mark the Line Wire Entrance Hole & Mounting Holes to be used,
      (the backboard or enclosure offers 10 mounting holes, although not all
      10 must be used.)  Use the diagram below to ensure the backboard or
      enclosure is not upside down or backwards.

   4. Drill through the marked holes on the wall using a drill bit similar
      to the size of the toggles being used.

   5. Route the telephone line cable through the Line Wire Entrance Hole.

   6. Insert each toggle bolt & washer through the mounting holes being
      used on the backboard or enclosure.

   7. Secure the backboard or enclosure against the wall through the
      pre-drilled holes & tighten each toggle bolt.


                    Separating the Upper & Lower Housing

   1. Insert the upper housing key into the upper housing lock (located
      on the right side of the phone) & turn it 1/8 turn counter clockwise.

   2. Insert the T-wrench key into the T- wrench insert (located approx.
      6 inches above the upper housing lock) & turn it 1/8 turn clockwise,
      until you hear the phone `snap' open.

    3. Slide the upper housing away from the lower housing (make sure the
       upper housing cable is disconnected from the circuit board.)


                     Removing the Circuit Board Chassis

   1. Disconnect the 4-wire Trigger Switch plug, (blue, red, white, &
      green plug.)

   2. Disconnect the 3-wire Relay plug (green, red, & white plug.)

   3. Disconnect the modular RJ11 Telephone Line connector.

   4. Disconnect the circuit board Ground wire.

      from the inside of the lower housing.


                         Removing the Coin Acceptor


   1. Remove the coin reject chute from the coin acceptor by loosening
   the screw that attaches the top of the reject chute to the bottom of
   the coin acceptor.

   2. Loosen the slotted nut at the top rear of the coin acceptor.

   3. Remove the coin acceptor by pulling it up & then outward, away from
      the inside of the lower housing.


                     Removing the Vault Door & Coin Box

   1. Insert the lower housing key into the lock on the left side of the
      lower housing & turn it ╝ turn counter-clockwise.

   2. Insert the T-wrench key into the vault door's vertical T-wrench key
      insert (located at the center of the vault door) & turn it 1/8 turn
      clockwise.

   3. Remove the vault door & the coin box from the vault area.



             Securing the Lower Housing to the Mounting Surface

   1. Insert the telephone line cable through the line wire entrance hole.

   2. Secure the lower housing to the backboard or enclosure mounting
      surface using seven ╝ x 20 x ╛ mounting screws.


                   Reinstalling the Coin Box & Vault Door

   1. Insert the coin box inside the vault area of the lower housing.

   2. Make sure the lower housing key is in the unlock position.

   3. Insert the T-wrench key into the vault door's vertical T-wrench key
      insert (located at the center of the vault door) & turn it ╝ turn
      clockwise.  

   4. Insert the vault door into the lower housing vault area & turn the
      T-wrench key ╝ turn counter-clockwise to secure it.

   5. Turn the lower housing key clockwise to the lock position & remove
      the key.


                       Reinstalling the Coin Acceptor

                  *READ TO INSURE PROPER COIN ALIGNMENT*


   1. Before re-installing the coin acceptor, ensure that the trigger
      switch unit that the coin acceptor installs on top of is firmly
      secured into the trigger switch sleeve in the back of the lower
      housing, (the trigger switch should not be loose.)

   2. Guide the tab at the bottom rear of the coin acceptor into the rear
      of the trigger switch.

   3. Position the top of the coin acceptor bracket onto the rear lip of
      the coin acceptor slotted nut & then tighten the nut.

   4. Reinstall the coin reject chute & secure the screw at the top of
      the reject chute to the bottom threads of the coin acceptor.


                   Reinstalling the Circuit Board Chassis

   1. Install the circuit board chassis by guiding the tab at the top,
      left of the chassis into the slot at the top, left of the lower
      housing. As you position tab, guide the captive nut onto the mounting
      stud of the lower left side of the lower housing & then tighten it.

   2. Connect the 4-wire Trigger Switch plug to the 4-prong Trigger Switch
      connector.

   3. Connect the 3-wire Relay plug to the 3-prong Relay connector.

   4. Connect the RJ11 modular plug to the Telephone Line connector.

   5. Connect the circuit board Ground wire to the middle right terminal
      of the terminal block.

   6. Connect the Battery plug (black & red wire plug) to the Battery
      connector of the circuit board. (The battery is not usually connected
      at the factory. To prevent the battery from draining, do not connect
      the battery until the telephone line is ready to be connected.)


                       Connecting the Telephone Line

   A minimum of 22ma (& 44 VDC) loop current must be provided to the
   payphone from the Telephone Company's Central Office. In certain
   situations, due to the distance between the Central Office and the
   phone site, the loop current may not meet the required level of 22ma.
   If the loop current is below 22ma, dial tone may not occur or the
   phone may experience only momentary burst of dial tone. It is
   recommended that the loop current level at the phone be tested at this
   time to ensure that the required loop current level is present.


   1. It is recommended that standard telephone / communication cable
      (No. 22 gauge, 2 pair or greater) be used to connect the telephone
      line with the payphone. Telephone / Communication cable usually
      consists of 2 or more pairs of color-coded wire.

   2. Connect one pair of communication cable wire to the two points of
      the Telco interface box (D Marc location) that the telephone line
      originates from.

   3. Connect the opposite end of the same pair of wire to the top left &
      bottom left terminal screws, (terminal block is located on the base of
      the payphone's lower housing.)

   4. Connect a proper earth ground wire to the left middle terminal to
      ensure safety.

   If using a line cord with a modular RJ11 plug instead of telephone /
   communication cable, disregard the RJ11 pigtail cord that originates
   from the terminal screws. Instead, plug in your incoming telephone
   line-cord directly to the circuit board RJ11 connector.


                  Re-Connecting the Upper & Lower Housing

   1. Connect the upper housing dial / hookswitch ribbon cable to the
      circuit board upper housing connector.

   2. Make sure the upper housing key is in the unlock position & the "T"
      wrench key is in the open position, (all the way forward.)

   3. Slide the bottom-lining of the upper housing along the lining of the
      lower housing until the two housings meet.

   4. Turn the T-wrench key 1/8 turn counter-clockwise until it `snaps'
      close & then remove both keys.

   This procedure, among others, is necessary if you are editing the
   current programming set-up. All program entries are done in the
   program mode, using the keypad of the payphone. When programming, one
   `beep' represents a completed entry. Three `beeps' represents an
   error. To start an entry over, press the # key & wait for three
   `beeps' & then re-try the entry. If you make a mistake on one entry,
   you do not have to re-do all other entries.


   1. Open the upper housing of the payphone, (see Separating the Upper &
      Lower Housing on pg. 4.)

   2. Ensure that the telephone line, dial / hookswitch ribbon cable, &

      should last approx. 2 minutes & cannot be interrupted once it has been
      started.


                      TESTING THE LOOP CURRENT LEVEL


   A minimum of 22ma (mili-amps) (or 44VDC) loop current must be provided
   to the CTR-201 from the Telephone Company's Central Office. In certain
   situations, due to the distance between the Central Office and the
   phone site, the loop current may not meet the required level of 22ma.
   If the loop current is below 22ma, dial tone may not occur or the
   phone may experience only momentary burst of dial tone. If the loop
   current level is below 22ma, you should contact your Local Telephone
   Co. 

    1. Locate a test meter (multi-meter) for this task.

    2. Set the meter to Amps DC.

    3. Make sure the incoming Telco tip wire is connected to the terminal
       block (located at the base of the lower housing.)

    4. Make sure the incoming Telco ring wire is disconnected from the
       terminal block.

    5. Connect one lead of the meter to the disconnected Telco ring wire.

    6. Disconnect the pigtail cable ring wire (red wire) from the
       terminal block.

    7. Connect the other lead of the meter to the disconnected pigtail
       cable ring wire.

    8. Lift the handset off-hook and record the loop current level shown
       on the meter. Verify that the reading is greater than 22ma (mili-amps).

Nevada probes Vegas phone hacks
Do hackers control sin city? Adult entertainment operators, private eyes, a
bail bondsman and his bounty hunter all say they've felt the pinch from a
shady cyberpunk syndicate. Now the state has launched an investigation, and
there could be millions on the line.

By Kevin Poulsen
May 14, 2001 1:12 AM PT

Eddie Munoz knows a secret about Las Vegas.

As the operator of one of the city's oldest in-room adult entertainment
services, Munoz knows Vegas is a town fuelled by the unceasing buzz of money
and vice. When he was at the top of his game his phones rang 100 times a
day, and he dispatched private nude "dancers" (prostitution is illegal in
Las Vegas) to the hotels along the Strip fifteen to twenty times a night,
raking in, he says, $240,000 a year in referral fees.

That's not the secret.

The secret, Munoz says, lies in the hundreds of miles of modern glass fiber
and aging copper wire buried beneath the town's sun-baked streets, and in
the dozens of digital switches that speed data and voice from one end of the
Strip to the other. Munoz believes that for a decade a shadowy cabal of
criminals, corrupt insiders and professional hackers has had an illicit
stranglehold on Vegas cyberspace, and all but muscled him out of the adult
entertainment industry by selectively blocking, tapping and rerouting the
telephone lines crucial to the outcall biz.

"In this business, you receive your calls from 5:00 in the afternoon until
5:00 in the morning, and that's when they hit us," says Munoz. "It's like
you're the Maytag man. The phone will not ring."

These days Munoz is lucky if he gets one or two customers a night, and his
once great empire of vice is a threadbare operation run from an office in
his home, far from Vegas' neon core. He's hanging on primarily through his
hard-won ownership of nearly half of the five hundred licensed news racks on
the Strip, which he crams with stacks of his own paper, "The Las Vegas
Informer" -- twelve gritty pages of advertisements for "Red Hot Red Heads"
and "Hot Hot Hot Tall Sexy Blondes." Until recently, every phone number
advertised in the paper went to Munoz's switchboard, yet his phones still
didn't ring. The economics of the situation eventually forced him to sell
advertising space to a competitor to pay the rent.
Munoz believes Soranno is one of the masterminds of a plot to destroy his
business; Soranno says that's exactly the kind of talk that nearly got him
whacked.
Munoz's phone problems are legion; his log of trouble-reports stretches
longer than a junkie's rap sheet. Callers from outside Vegas, or from
payphones and cell phones, get through, he says, but hotel callers get false
busy signals, or reach silence, driving them into the arms of competing
services. Sometimes calls are rerouted directly to a competitor, he claims.
And when a would-be customer does get through, and Munoz dispatches a dancer
to the tourist's hotel room, she's likely to find another entertainer
already there. "Sometimes they beat us to the calls, like they're
listening," says Munoz.

At least three other adult entertainment outfits, a private investigator and
a bail bondsman have reported similar patterns. "I'd get half a ring, and
pick up the phone, and there would be no one there," says Hilda Brauer, the
former owner of the now-defunct "Sexy Girls" outcall service. In 1998,
Brauer filed suit against the local phone company, a competitor she blamed
for the problem, and the publisher of the Donnelly Directory, in which Sexy
Girls had seven full page ads. She later dropped the suit, closed her
business, and now makes her living telling fortunes for a psychic hotline.
"I lost my home, I had to sell my furniture to get money to move into an
apartment," says Brauer.

Peter Vilencia, a former bail bondsman, had phone problems as well. Vilencia
purchased Bail Bonds Inc. in 1996, and, after a week of brisk business
springing drunken tourists and small time crooks from the Clark County
Detention Center, he suddenly suffered a sharp drop in call volume. "At 4:00
in the afternoon Friday, my phone would stop ringing," says Vilencia, who
sold the company last year. "Almost every weekend for nearly four years, you
could set your watch by it."

Sabotage defies testing
"We would lose our phones from Friday night, through the weekend, and that's
the most common time people get arrested," recalls Mike Kapfer, Vilencia's
former bounty hunter. Sometimes the phones would half-ring, as though call
forwarding was in effect; more commonly, inmates would seem to be switched
to a competing bond writer in mid call. Only calls from the jail were at
risk. "If I tried calling the number from my cell phone, it would go
through," says Kapfer.

Both men agree with Munoz and Brauer that someone is pulling strings from
deep within the network. "I had guys watching the building in the back where
the phone lines come in, and the junction boxes down the street," says
Vilencia. "It had to be internal, nobody else had access."

But even after Brauer's lawsuit, years of formal complaints from Munoz, a
written complaint from a private investigator who claimed to be losing
calls, and two stories about the call diversion allegations in The New York
Times, the local phone company is adamant that nothing is wrong.

"We've run our tests, we've spent time and resources on this, and we haven't
seen any indication of call diversion," says Scott Collins, of Sprint
subsidiary Central Telephone's department of regulatory affairs. Last
November, at the direction of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (PUC),
the phone company ran three days of test calls from five different Las Vegas
hotels: the Sahara, Travel Lodge, Vagabond, Motel 6, and Four Queens. Of 205
calls, all but 23 went through, and none were diverted to competitors.
(Further investigation of the 23 incomplete calls turned up innocent
explanations.) Testing by AT&T in 1997 produced similar results.

Munoz blames leaks -- he says everyone knew the tests were taking place, and
the culprits deliberately let the calls slip through. But in December, a
reporter's call from a Vegas hotel also went through without incident.

Could the Vegas cyber jacking be a myth, woven from the detritus of failed
businesses and blurry technological anecdotes? If so, it's a myth that's
attained the status of 'common knowledge' on Vegas' nocturnal fringe, and in
one bizarre case, it almost made an adult entertainment operator the victim
of brutal mob reprisal.

Vinnie "Aspirins" and his power drill
It happened in 1998: An FBI investigation into police corruption in Vegas
turned up a six-man organized crime plot to muscle in on a handful of
successful Las Vegas outcall services, which had been trouncing a mob-backed
venture headed by one of the men, Christiano DeCarlo.

According to court documents, the conspirators, allegedly affiliated with
the Gambino crime family, were particularly interesting in moving in on
Richard Soranno, the owner of one of the town's largest services, Vegas
Girls. They believed Soranno had been diverting phone calls from
competitors, including DeCarlo, with the help of a mysterious computer
expert named Charles Coveney.

"Coveney has contacts in the Sprint Telephone Company and is able to have
telephone calls diverted from one number to another," the gangsters
believed, according to an FBI affidavit. The men expected to "persuade"
Coveney to leave Seranno "and assist DeCarlo in his out call business by
diverting telephone calls to DeCarlo." Among the persuasive tools at the
gang's disposal, an enforcer named Vinnie "Aspirins" Congiusti, flown in
from Tampa, who reputedly earned his nickname by once using a cordless power
tool to drill holes in someone's head.

When the mobsters began scouring Las Vegas for Coveney, the FBI was forced
to swoop in, prematurely pulling the plug on a massive undercover operation.
All six men later plead guilty to conspiracy. Vinnie "Aspirins" died in jail
from apparent heart failure last year.

Today, there's no love lost between Munoz and Soranno; Munoz believes, but
admits he cannot prove, that Soranno is one of the masterminds of a plot to
destroy his business, while Soranno says that's exactly the kind of talk
that nearly got him whacked. "It all got started because Munoz picked up on
a rumor and made it into a thing," says Soranno. "He put my life in danger."
The sex mogul says he doesn't know anyone named Charles Coveney, and has
triumphed in the adult entertainment trade purely through marketing skill
and general business acumen. "Munoz is the worst businessman in the world,"
Soranno says. "If you were the worst businessman in the world, would you get
calls?"

Telco: Vegas is hack proof
But even Soranno sees corruption in the ebb and flow of Vegas' telephonic
tide -- though not in Sprint's network. At some hotels, he believes, corrupt
insiders monitor the PBX logs for calls to adult entertainment services.
When they spot one, they leapfrog the service by sending their own
entertainer to the guest's room. "Once they know there's an interested
party, they can send someone up," says Soranno. If true, the tactic would
explain the duplicate-dancer scenario Munoz reports. "If a girl goes to a
call, and another girl is already there, the first thing they think is
someone's tapping the phone," says Soranno.

Sprint's Collins says that, as far as Sprint Central Telephone knows, the
company has never had a problem with corrupt employees or hackers of any
kind. "No one that we're aware of," says Collins. "We haven't had any
indication that any of that has happened."

The company came to the same conclusion in September 1995, in response to a
complaint filed with the Nevada PUC (then called the Public Service
Commission) by Hilda Brauer. According to documents in the case, the
commission's staff concluded that the volume of complaints suggested
something was indeed rotten in Vegas cyberspace, but there was no "probable
cause" to believe Sprint Central Telephone was culpable. The commission
noted that the telephone company had "followed established rules and
regulations and had turned up no evidence of an illegal intrusion into its
network."

For decades, regional and long distance telephone companies from coast to
coast have seen hackers gain control of critical systems. Most recently, in
1999 federal officials won guilty pleas from three members of a nationwide
hacker group they dubbed "The Phone Masters." Until the FBI raided them in
1995, The Phone Master had access to Sprint Long Distance, Southwestern Bell
and GTE computers, and in some areas of the country were able to obtain
unlisted phone numbers, monitor phone lines, and leverage their access to
crack unrelated systems, including the FBI's National Crime Information
Center (NCIC).

If Sprint Central Telephone has never been hacked, the company is a rarity
among telecommunications carriers. But SecurityFocus has learned that the
company's Las Vegas network may not be immune to hackers after all.

"Vegas was easy"
Until he went on the lam in the early nineties, Las Vegas was a
home-away-from-home for the world's most famous hacker, Kevin Mitnick, who
had family in town. And from approximately 1992 until his February 1995
arrest, Mitnick says he enjoyed substantial illicit access to the Vegas
network. What's more, he recalls once being approached with an offer to
redirect calls from an adult entertainment service for a single weekend, for
$3,000. "They wanted me to somehow take control of the line and forward it,"
Mitnick recalls."

"It would have taken, had I wanted to do it, all of three minutes."

Currently under court supervision after five years in prison, Mitnick is not
known to have ever cashed in on his hacking, and he says he never
participated in a call diversion scheme. But he points to two specific holes
in the Las Vegas network that would make such a scheme possible for a
knowledgeable insider, or a sophisticated hacker.

For starters, Mitnick says he had direct access to the control consoles on
Vegas' switching systems through dial-up modems. Each Nortel DMS switch had
a secret phone number, and a default username and password. The dial-ups
were normally inaccessible, and Mitnick had to call a Sprint employee and
pose as a technician to get the lines turned on, he says. Once that was
done, "I had the same access to the switch that the techs did," he recalls:
total control over how calls are routed.

With access to the switches, Mitnick found it useful to launder his calls
through sin city as an anti-tracing tactic, even when he was hiding out in
Seattle and Raleigh, North Carolina, "Vegas was easy," Mitnick says.

The second hole is a testing system pronounced "Callers" -- Mitnick says he
never saw its name in print, so he doesn't know how it was spelled or
capitalized. As he describes it, the system was designed to allow phone
company workers to run tests on customer lines, "loops" in the parlance of
telephony, from a central location. The system consisted of a handful of
client computers, and remote servers attached to each of Sprint Central
Telephone's DMS-100 switches.

Vegas' remote servers were poorly protected, Mitnick says. They were
accessible through low-speed dial-up modems, guarded by a technique only
slightly more secure than simple password protection: the server required
the client -- normally a computer program -- to give the proper response to
any of 100 randomly chosen challenges. "It would prompt you with a query,
and you would have to answer promptly," Mitnick says. "It was a number, like
54, and it had a certain hex response, like 3FAE."

Mitnick says he was able to learn the Las Vegas dial-up numbers by conning
Sprint workers, and he snagged the "seed list" of challenges and responses
from the company that made the system, Ontario-based Northern Telecom,
renamed in 1999 to Nortel Networks. "I had to call Nortel and have one of
the engineer's talk me though it," says Mitnick. "I told them I was writing
software that had to interface with it."

The system allowed users to silently monitor phone lines, or originate and
answer phone calls on other people's lines, Mitnick says. "All you needed
was a laptop and a phone." The implications go well beyond mere
call-napping. "Somebody with real criminal intent, in a city like Las
Vegas-- think of the possibilities."

Nortel spokesman David Chamberlin dismissed Mitnick's account as "wild
speculation" and "rumor." But a list on the company web site offers a
feature called "CALRS", "Centralized Automated Loop Reporting System," as an
option on the company's DMS line of switches. Elsewhere on the site, Nortel
literature describes CALRS as an "external test access system."

A Sprint spokesperson, and an attorney representing the company, both
declined to comment on CALRS, and would neither confirm nor deny the
existence of a poorly protected testing system that might be an open door
into the inner sanctum of Vegas' telecommunications infrastructure.

Public hearings set
The company may not be able to stay mum forever. After fielding years of
complaints, the State of Nevada is now taking Munoz's allegations seriously.
In February, over Sprint's objections, the PUC found "probable cause" for a
full investigation, and has scheduled public hearings for September.
Meanwhile, the commission is demanding answers. Last month it formally
served Sprint with a "data request" asking, among other things, whether the
company has ever been hacked. The company responded Thursday, once again
claiming that there was no evidence that it had ever suffered from corrupt
employees or outside intruders.

Sprint's Collins is no longer talking to reporters, referring calls to the
company's outside counsel, Patrick Reilly, a lawyer with the Nevada law firm
Hale Lane Peek Dennison Howard and Anderson. "To our knowledge, there's been
no evidence of a breach of the network," says Reilly.

"Now I have subpoena power," says Munoz. "Look out."

"Eddie's been knocking on people's doors, various governmental entities, for
years, and as far as I know this is the first genuine forum that he's
gotten," says Nevada PUC consumer complaint manager Rick Hackman. "Although
he hasn't convinced us that Sprint is at fault, we believe that he deserves
the forum to make his case in front of the full commission."

The PUC decision to hold hearings is an enormous victory for Munoz, and it
raises the stakes for Sprint Central Telephone. If Munoz prevails, the
commission could impose monetary fines and sanctions. Further, Munoz says
he'll sue the company for $20 million.

That's the price, he says, for ten years of lost business, in a period
that's seen mind boggling growth in the city. Construction of super hotels
like the Bellagio, the Venetian, Paris, and Aladdin have pushed Las Vegas'
guest capacity to over 120,000 hotel rooms, and the city now hosts some four
thousand conventions each year. And that's a lot of people who could have
been trying to call one of Munoz's Hot Hot Hot Tall Sexy Blondes.

GUTSCI Protocol
---------------

Hello, all. This is my first contribution to this zine, and I'm
sad to say it will be, for the most part a cut-and-dry and not to interesting
article that will propose some standards for the GUTSCI protocol.

GUTSCI, or Global Underground Technology Secure Communications Infrastructure
(pronounced gut-see) was first proposed by Agent Smith in a brief
article outlining the purpose and rational behind the protocol,
without going into much (any) specifics of how the technical aspects
should work.

You should be able to find Smith's original article at nettwerked.net,
unless the link is dead.


Basically, GUTSCI is a secure chatting, instant messaging, and file
transfer protocol. It's major focus is to develop a cryptographically
secure, anonymous peer-to-peer system. That means that we can't
rely on any central server whatsoever, all communication must use
open cryptographic standards, authentication must take place peer
to peer (this should prove to be exceedingly difficult...).

Anyways, I'm sure it's obvious by now that this model poses many
obstacles, not the least of which that peer-to-peer communication
is almost unheard of because of it's difficulty in designing a reliable
secure system around it, but I wholy believe it's possible.

One last thing before I jump into the technicalities of the program,
this project will only be able to grow and develop if we get lots
of feedback, suggestions, criticism, etc.



The Protocol
------------

The entire protocol will take place over a TCP/IP network. There will
be a standard (though adjustable) port. The port has yet to be
determined. All connections will use simple BSD sockets, connect() and
whatnot. This is so we can port it to the maximum number of operating
systems possible.

People can be running 3 different services on their machine at once,
although only 1 is required, all of them having their own standard
port number.

1 --- Server
2 --- Client
3 --- Messaging

Now what's all this about server/client? I thought it was supposed to
be peer-to-peer? Is this guy on crack? Well, that's none of your
damn business. Actually, since anyone can set up any of these services
and link them together effortlessly, it will still be a peer-to-peer
system. Keep reading.

Once the server is launched (probably as a daemon, and *NOT AS ROOT*)
it will just sit there listening for open connections. It will respond
differently to each request, of course. One notable case is that it
will be able to accept connections from other servers as well as clients,
enabling a network of GUTSCI severs to build up. More later.

The client connects to the server, and can issue it various commands,
but will inevitably either have the connection terminated, or be
joined to a chat room. More later.

The messanger will maintain a connection with the server, much like
the client, but will not be joined to a chat room, it will just sit
and listen for messages off the GUTSCI network. More later.


Connection Requests
-------------------

CHAT AS &lt;name>

-Rather simple really. A client connects to a server, and the server
 connects the client to a chat room with all the other parties that
 have connected to that server then sends 'Ok.'. One last note:
 everything sent to the server from a client is concatenated with the 
 name that the client submitted on the chatting request, so here might
 be a typical connection:

Client connects to server.
Client sends -> CHAT AS JimmyJazz
Client recieves <- Ok.
Client sends -> Hey guys. 
Server sends out to all clients -> &lt;JimmyJazz> Hey guys.

etc.

Note: The actual messages will be encrypted, and this will be standardized
in the client, *not* the server.



RELAY &lt;random string of text>

-Sends another relay to all of the server's it has LATCHed onto (more later),
 except the one it got the RELAY request from. The RELAY that it sends will
 have the exact same string of random text as the original RELAY.



LATCH &lt;server> [port]

-Tells the server to make an attempt to latch onto &lt;server>. The server
 would go through a couple of steps first.

   The server makes a connection to &lt;server> on the optional port [port],
   And does a RELAY. It then listens for 5 seconds to see if that random
   string of text gets back to it. If it doesn't, then it adds &lt;server>
   to the BOTTOM of it's list of servers to connect to. Note, the LATCH
   connection will still be open, and the server will send back either:
   "Ok." or "Relay loop.". If it recieves "Relay loop." it will drop the
   connection. If it recieves "Ok." then it also will add the server to
   the BOTTOM of it's list of servers to connect to. Note, some error
   checking must be in place to prevent a server from being listed more
   than once in the list. Once this latch connection is open, messages
   will be sent both ways in the connection. This is how the instant
   messaging feature will work.



MESSAGING AS &lt;name>

-The server forwards all messages destined to &lt;name> to this person, as well
 as relaying them to the next server. It will also take any messages from
 this connection and then send it to all of it's LATCHed connections.




As you can see, the server offers little security whatsoever. All of the
encryption will be standardized in the client. Sure, you'll be able to use
somebody elses nick, and you'll be able to recieve all of his/her messages, but
you won't have their private key so you will be unable to read it.

Also, the client will encrypt all messages in a channel, so if you don't
have the particular key that people are using on that server, you won't
be able to read what they're saying.


NC Hack: Ok, I've already released some unpolished crappy code. The worst
part is, it doesn't follow this protocol at all. Yeah, that's funny.
It doesn't support messaging, you can't specify a name, basically all that
you do is connect to the server, it sends you a port number, you connect
to that port, and anything you send will be sent to anyone else on that
server. Check out the README included with that release for more info.
I intend to write a server that fully follows this protocol eventually.

The main body of code is in the gutsec program. Basically, this program
is a piece of tubing you can put in a pipe (in unix, of course), and
if you specify the -e &lt;key> option, it will 3DES encrypt everything
from stdin and send it to stdout. Likewise with the -d option, but it
decrypts. I also went to great lengths to make sure that only human
readable ASCII characters were transmitted through the pipe. Oh, and don't
use it for a reliable data transfer yet. It garbles about .5% of the text
you send through. Not bad, but I hope to fix this soon. Once I get all
the bugs worked out, I'm considering making a seperate program called
spipe or something.

Anyways, to be perfectly honest I'm beginning to reconsider the design
issues around GUTSCI, and I'm thinking maybe it should be either
an instant messaging protocol or a chatting protocol. Let me know what
you think.

I'm even thinking of maybe dropping this project, and working on a secure
client for IRC since IRC is already an established interface, and has
proved to be extremely popular, and difficult to shut down. Maybe even
a trusted bot that has a key from everyone, and when it gets a message,
it decrypts it, encrypts it with the destinations key and sends it to him.
Of course this raises question's like "Can I trust the bot owner?" and "Is he
logging my messages?". Maybe the bot could be a public key server. Anyways,
I'm itching to do something. Let me know what you think.
