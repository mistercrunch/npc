  NEWS: For All Hack Canada Writers


 I thought I'd advertise this in my zine, just incase you haven't already read this on
 Hack Canada. A crook by the name of Dale K. Kubin has outright stolen every file from
 Hack Canada (files that have been written by a dozen or so authors) and put them in a
 couple of "hacking" books. This isn't about information sharing, or helping to get the
 word out about talented hackers/phreakers. This is just a case of some greedy asshole
 who decided he could make money by stealing files that WE (the underground community)
 have worked countless hours on.

 If you want more information, please read what Cyb0rg/ASM had to say:

          Exploration of Wireless Networks Using the 802.11b protocol

 It seems that the new thing in the underground is breaking into various systems via a
 wireless connection. This is so because the wired equivalent protocol (WEP) has, especially
 recently, been shown to be flawed. What WEP attempts to do is deliver an infrastructure that
 makes it harder to "plug in" to the wireless network. Picture a corporate LAN with ethernet
 jacks every meter along the walls. This is what WEP actually accomplishes :) Also remember
 that wireless networks reach beyond the area they are meant to service, so not only are there
 ethernet jacks every meter along the walls, they go down the street a few blocks as well.

 WEP protects a network using a 40/64-bit or 128bit key. When wireless network was still in
 diapers security was not a priority, walking was. Some of WEP's problems stem from mistakes
 in the algorithm. WEP has addresses that can be forged. /* here, it's not WEP that's at fault.
 802.11 emulates a standard ethernet in a wire-free form, and as part of the 802.foo specs,
 there are MAC addresses that are a part of the level 2 protocol. these are in theory spoofable,
 but in practice it's not always as easy. There are genuinely few cards that allow you to change
 the mac address, and out of those that do, sometimes (this is the case with wavelan based cards,
 such as the AIRport and Lucent cards) at the -hardware- level it get's blocked by the card itself.
 For the wavelan based cards, there exists a firmware patch that lucent will only release under strict
 NDA and licensing that will enable the cards to broadcast level-2 packets that contain source addresses
 -other- than their hard coded address. */and lastly, the encryption key or keys must be shared by all
 the users on the same network. This most of all reduces the security level of the network, as the -same-
 key get sent out repeatedly and once you get the key, there is nothing in the way except for possible
 encryption at level's 3 or 4.  

 When a wireless network is being created most people either do not test the placement of the base
 station(s), or do not take into account such things as brick walls that block the signals, or large
 metal plates that may reflect the signal Or the park bench down the street that for some reason, the
 packets fly by.

 Now that you are interested in this subject you first need to know how to access these magical wireless
 networks. The first thing you will need is a computer with 802.11 compatibility. Laptops are always
 preferred, for the obvious reasons, and keep in mind that there are different revisions of the 802.11
 specification. The original spec called for 2mb/s and no WEP. The next level, 802.11c introduced WEP and
 11mb/s, and with 802.11b we saw 128 bit keys for WEP. There is a new spec coming online now, 802.11a.
 This will allow 54mbs sans-fils, although I believe it offers no improvements to the WEP feature.
 As of this writing (fall 2001) there is just one company producing these new cards, with others promised
 for the near future.

 Before we get into the fun parts, there are a few things that I think you should know about if you want
 to have FWNW (Fun With No Wires, watch out, it's addictive), and that is simply a little about the structure
 of the layer-1 802.11 packets. These packets are remarkably similar to low-level ethernet packets, but with
 additions for ESSID (Extended Service Session ID), encryption (by WEP), and Station names, which are different
 than MAC addresses in that they are strings, as opposed to a series of hex digits. These an also be duplicate,
 and quite often base stations (or access points, whatever) have the Station name set the as the ESSID, for
 simplicities sake. So, you have to remember that each network broadcasts using the same Session ID, and that
 each station is assigned a Station ID. Normally ESSID's are manually assigned, using whatever tool your OS
 supports. One neat thing though is that the 802.11 spec says that if there is no ESSID set and the interface
 transmits or receives a packet, then the card is to use whichever ESSID it finds first. If the card gets reset
 (you can force resets via software), then it looks for another ESSID, and failing that, falls back on the old one.
 At this point light bulbs should be going off in your head, as this is the basis of wireless network scanning.

 There are multiple ways you can go about looking for these networks, either by using one of the pre-made pieces
 of software such as AP Scanner, which runs on Apple (used and recommended by Magma). I know there are a few of
 these on freshmeat, graphical and/or console. Or,if you are like me then you could just write your own in perl.
 I'll give you some tips and a simple script at the end of the file. Lots of the wardriving (or warbiking, or
 warwalking) sites stress that you need an external antenna, and I'd like to say that while helpful, they are
 hardly necessary. Most of the time when I'm scanning, I'll be walking around with my laptop in my backpack,
 and a headphone running to my ear for output from the scanner. I personally own an iBook, and these have an
 omni directional antenna which has some front-back tendencies (the signal goes more forward and backwards than
 side to side), and it works fine. Now, if you are in a car, it's a bit different, as you are traveling at a
 higher velocity, and (in most cases) farther from the buildings. Although I must say that I have used my laptop
 sans antenna from a moving car, and it does work, just requires a bit more planning in the placement of the laptop.

 For the most part, to get online via an 802.11 it's quite easy for the simple reason that most people either
 forget or forgo a WEP password for whatever their reason may be. If this is the case you can simply assign the
 discovered ESSID or have it automatically set for you, and then your card will begin catching the desired packets.

 /* I don't know about this section as much, as I haven't done too much with wep
    cracking. I'm just rewriting this part for clarity :) */

 If there is WEP in the picture, things change somewhat. Some of the more advanced scanners (I'm not sure if there
 are any free ones that do this, I know the scripts' I've written and seen don't do this) will report ESSID's for
 networks that have WEP enabled. If this is the case, then you can just make a brute force cracker, but this can
 take a while as passwords can run into quite a few characters long. Fortunately, as we know, WEP is insecure.
 The theories for cracking it have been around for quite some time, and in the past few months people have released
 software (some commercial, some freeware/GPL with names like Airsnort and WEPcrack) that does it at the click of a
 button. The only prerequisite for most of these pieces of software is large amounts of data to fool with. You need
 to gather packets at the site in question for periods of time ranging from minutes to hours. Also, most of the already-
 written crackers are dependent on specific wireless chipsets, like the prism2 chipset. Depending on your situation,
 this may or not be a problem. If the target network is located at a public library or a coffee shop, then you would
 have no problem staying there for hours at a time. If the network is located on a busy downtown street, then your
 options are more restricted to things such as walking back and forth multiple times a day, compiling the packet logs
 over a period of weeks, or even months, or even just sitting in there stairwell for a few hours. The software will
 then analyze the packet logs and try to guess which packets have encoding problems, that is, the sources of randomness
 (SYN numbers, TCP flags) weren't computed as well as they could have been. I don't have much experience with this
 personally, because none of the networks I've found so far have had WEP activated :). And never forget of course the
 time honored traditions of brute forcing and guessing. It's easy, just use perl, and apply the same steps as mentioned
 for collecting data. The key is for these things is that you don't have to be connected all the time, you could, for
 example, take a detour on the way to work each morning and wander around the building the target network is located.
 Or even just walk past it. If it's a busy network, there will be plenty of traffic, even for the few minutes it takes
 you to walk past. And remember that 802.11 is a level 2 protocol, so all the dns queries, arp queries, WOL (wake on lan),
 things like that are always floating around out there, just waiting for an antenna.

 There are many opinions on the ways you can actually go out and find networks, and I'm going to go over a few just to
 give you some inspiration. First off, humans have been graced with two feet. They are very useful. Personally, I prefer
 to do all my packet hunting on foot, as this allows you to get the closest to the networks themselves, or to go inside
 and hide in a stairwell at a moments notice. As far as user interface goes, my scripts so far have used audio output,
 and I wear a headphone in one ear while I'm scanning. Using speech synthesis, the scripts let me know what's going on.
 There are of course numerous disadvantages to this. It's slow, you can't cover nearly as much ground as most other methods,
 and it can be suspicious looking (try walking downtown with one headphone in your ear and holding a directional antenna
 made from a tomato juice tin and an old nintendo zapper, with it's lead running into your backpack, and you'll know what
 I mean). But if you don't own a car, and you don't always carry around external antennas (*wink*) then this method is
 pretty much the most anonymous of them all. You're just another monkey with a backpack, one of hundreds out there...
 The next most popular method (and the one with a catchy media term) is using a car. In your car, you can be warm, and
 you can interactively use the computer while you comfortably sit down, not exerting your legs at all. One thing I've
 noticed is that it really really helps to have an external antenna while doing this, as you are traveling at a higher
 velocity and the networks are in general farther away. This isn't to say that you won't pick up any networks, you just
 won't pick up as many.

 Sniffing packets as they go by or using software to find Base stations is a passive attack meaning that you don't leave
 a trial. This also means that the admin on a system cannot what you are doing. However, once you connect to a network you
 leave behind the MAC (same as on a wired LAN)address of your wireless card. In theory if you cause substantial amounts of
 damage you could be tracked down through it (buy your 802.11 card using cash, kids). You've been warned but do keep in mind
 that this scenario is not very likely to happen, as it's quite resource intensive.

 /* :( dos is silly.*/

 Just when you thought you have heard the last of Denial Of Service attacks. Yes, you can do such a thing to a wireless
 network. Due to the nature of radio transmission wireless networks are very prone to denial of service attacks. If you
 really wanted to crash a network and had a powerful enough transceiver you could easily create enough interference that 
 the wireless network would be unable to communicate. This kind of attack can be done from a somewhat remote location for
 example in an apartment on the same block as the network. If you are or know someone that is well versed in short-wave 
 radio you should have no problem in creating such a mess. At a reasonable price too. There is a much simpler way to cause
 the same effect of a somewhat smaller scale. I'll use my ibook as an example. The software that was shipped with my ibook
 allows me to use my ibook or another computer with a wireless card as a software base station. What this means is that 
 I can use it as an access point without buying a base station. This is an option for some people that only have two wireless
 cards but lack a hardware base station. So now you know why Apple ships this software. The wonderful thing is that when
 I activate my ibook as a software base station and walk into any area that has a wireless network, I'll use a university for
 this example. It causes everyone within 150 feet (the distance increases when you can an antenna) to try to connect to me
 rather then the network the university has. This is done because most people will connect to the access point with the
 strongest signal. Of course my signal will be stronger if I'm right beside you. As you can see this will cause people to not
 be able to access the information they are seeking. As soon as I leave the area all will be fine.

 This large gap in security may not be around for too much longer. Under development are new versions of both WEP and 802.11b
 protocols that will include stronger security features such as personal password. This may mean new hardware for those
 currently operation wireless networks, or it may come in the form of software patches. However, these features will not be
 released until mid-2002 at best.

 In the meantime, there are other options out there, ranging from IPsec to other things involving dynamic interactive
 firewalls, to only using ssh and remote X on your machine :)

This file pertains to Loops in the form of wiring, commonly called 
a pair, the twisted pair, or just the "line" and/or "phone line".

Normally Analyzing a loop requires a 250$ multimeter from Radio Shack
with a serial cable(phlux style anyways), or a toner/probe set, 
and other tools, which are usually expensive.

One can easily overcome this with a telephone patch cable, or even just
an RJ-11 mod(female) jack(jill?) on your wall.

By simply touching the ring(red) and tip(green) wires on your tongue,
a short is created, and your tongue is the load in some sense. If the
pair that you analyzed is onhook, you will feel a zap, and the area of 
your tongue that you electrocuted will be numb for a bit.

When a line is idle (onhook) there is generaly 40~volts across ring and 
tip, and you will learn to 'taste' this.

If an extension on the pair is off hook, there will generaly be around
9~ volts on the pair. There is only a mild sensation (on my pair anyways)
much like licking a 9 volt battery at full capacity.

You will easily be able to tell the difference as to wether or not your
line is idle or not, by the self inflicted electrocution. With a powerful
short, your reflexes act faster then your hand, and your head will pull
back as you remove the wires/mod jack from your tongue. Keep this in mind
when licking raw terminals from an open baseboard style mod jack setup.
(with 2 lines and 4 terminals in those little plastic boxes, this can
 be a challenge.)

This technique is also good for testing the integrity of Radio Shacks
"WebLock Phone Lock" part #279-8511 where there is a single female mod
jack on a surface wall mount plate with a physical key lock as the
on/off switch. If it is determined that there is no current, one can 
quickly unscrew the cover and rewire.

I find this technique a lot faster then most conventional methods, and 
therefore it is suited for the field.

One thing you need to keep in mind is that the voltage across the pair
when the line is being rung, it is around 90volts. If you were just
touching a pair with 90 volts going through, i'm sure you would be fine,
however your tongue is a better conducter then your skin.

(grade 7 science rules!)

 'S#         #S
  'SSSSSSSSSS'
      ' - '
Legend:
the "x" 's denote taste buds that are sensitive to sourness
the "#" 's denote taste buds that are sensitive to saltyness
the "S" 's denote taste buds that are sensitive to sweetness

The middle portion of the tongue (Fillform papillae) are sensitive to
sour flavors. 

Personally i found the # region of the tongue to be the best portion to 
electrocute as it's not as sensitive as the very tip or frontal portion of 
the tongue. Keep this in mind if you don't want your tongue numbed...
(it really isn't that bad) A spare 9v can serve as practice.

_____________________________________________________________________/

Licking a twisted pair and not a mod jack(if you do, make sure it's a
male one fag) allows for more control over the electrocution.
When you get good you will be able to grab any pair/patch/mod
and check its state and you may wonder how you did without.

_____
Notes:
-Avoid analyzing mod jacks, as it's harder to press your tongue into
 the slits, stay away from female mod connectors(resist!)

-Avoid analyzing foreign pairs as a ring could be fatal.

-During analysis, always avoid using the tip of the tongue.

-Stay away from digital lines, if in doubt the multimeter ye shall
 bust out.

TTY isn't something every phreak needs to concern themselves with, its quite
simple, but at the same time it can definately be useful to know how to use
one, as there are Telus millennium payphones equiped with TTY keyboards.
This will save you lots of money if your constantly paging the fuck out of
someone because they dont know how to turn on theyre fucking cellphone.

Local TTY calls placed through TRS (711) are free.
Long distance is charged 50% off the regular rates.

                                                ;
I'll let Telus explain they're TTY relay service;
                                                ;
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'

A person who is deaf, hard of hearing or speech disabled uses a TTY to type
his / her conversation to a Relay Operator who then reads the typed
conversation to a hearing person. The TELUS Relay Operator then types the
hearing person's spoken words back to the TTY user. 

So an operator relays what you type, pretty much. You can use your modem and
a terminal program (i recomend Super Terminal by super voice for windows,
minicom for linux) and use the service, or you can purchase TTY hardware
(a tele-typewriter) which can be acoustical. Check ebay.

-
Important TTY terms+definitions.
TRS=Telus Relay Service
TTY=Teletypewriter
TDD=Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (now defunct, use TTY)
CA=Communications Assistant
GA=Go Ahead
SK or SKSK (stop keying, do this before you disconnect)
q=? Due to incompatability issues, the letter q is used to denote a question
    mark.

VCO=Voice Carry Over(VCO enables you to speak directly to the person you are
calling, for hearing impaired people who can speak clearly. When you connect
to a CA, just say 'requesting VCO, GA' or equivelant to use this feature) VCO
can only be turned on when the call is answered, to which she will announce
'VCO on GA' or something.

HCO=Hearing Carry Over(you can hear but can't talk, same as above but reverse.)

When using the service, common abbreviations will be understood by the CA:
PLS=Please
GA=Go Ahead
NBR=Number
OPR=Operator (or CA)
DA=Directory Assistance
ASAP=As Soon As Possible
MSG or MSGE=Message
PPL=People
-

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your first TTY call:
Any old modem will do, use SuperVoice for windows(it can transmit baudot i
believe) of you can just use minicom in linux, all you need is a minidistro,
so you can dedicate a vintage computer to the task of TTYing quite well.

Use the modem string: ATDT711
This will dial 711 using DTMF.

If you want, you could set your modem to auto answer incoming calls, and if
any are TTY you can connect and talk...
Extra Fun: setup a baudot TTY BBS :P

With most TTY devices there is an LED on them somewheres that blinks to
signify ringing/busy.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Using a TRS payphone:

The only TTY payphones i have seen are Telus Millenniums, which have a keyboard
mounted under the booth where the phone book would normaly be. You will most
likely only find TTY payphones indoors for obvious reasons. Keep reading for
Alberta/BC TTY payphone locations or just goto an airport, bus depot, or any
other place that caters to lots of people.

There is 2 wires coming out of the TTY keyboard, one white, one black.
This most likely means the TTY keyboard is non dependant of the millennium,
to test, try splicing into these 2 wires and hooking up your test set.
If you get a dialtone, you can unscrew the 6 screws holding the keyboard
to the booth for a free TTY. Do not do this.

When a TTY call is inititated on a TTY payphone, the keyboard will open,
watch the LED to see ringing. The keyboard will close upon disconnect unless
a key is pressed to keep it open.

If you want to annoy someone during a voice call, press the * key 3 times and
the payphones voice will say 'TTY call, use text telephone' 
Anyone know how to change the TTY call alert message?


If you are from a standard payphone, or any phone for that matter, you can
call 1 800 855 0511 and a TRS CA will ask the number of the TTY user you wish
to call.

Avoid speaking after the operator has said 'go ahead'. TTY operators are just
there to relay, you cannot talk to them(trust me).
Also they MUST relay everything you say. You can instruct them to spell stuff
like fear 'ph33r'. You can talk about phreaking telus, or whatever, they just
relay it all... Don't talk too fast because remember the op has to type it all

If you've used CB or any kinda radio you shouldn't have a problem with the
relay service. It's just half duplex, so remember to tell the CA GA when you
are done.

I don't know how updated that list is... you could probably phone 711 and ask
if theres one in your area.

So what are the benefits of using TRS?

I have verified that local TTY calls through TRS are toll free, even from
payphones. For extra curicular: Use a computer, a 386 with minicom+2 modems
is all you need. Have 2 TTY ops talk to eachother on a loop. The TTY ops will
know theyre relaying to one another, and they must wonder why the two TTY users
 aren't just calling eachother direct. The joy of this is obvious.
 (telus lesbian TTY phone sexor!)

 TTY can be very anonymous, your voice cannot be used in biometrics and that
 shit. You can specify male or female operators if you really want.

 This is good for having a TTY op set your voice mail/pager greeting, or
 whatever else.

 I would like to try having TRS dialup a simple text only BBS.
 Perhaps as a little service for phone phreaks, one could make a TTY
 on a spare line accept calls that would announce recieved ANI/Caller ID,
 it would perform line tests, anything.. could be fun.

TTY is somewhat secure, if its your mom trying to listen in on your call
and she hears modem like tones and thinks your on the internet or something..
Could also be fun, but REMEMBER (baudot is carrierless.. no more NO CARRIER)

TTY is a service intended for the hard of hearing and speech impaired.
There isn't as many TTY ops as there is TSPS. Do not abuse this service.
By all means experiment with it, but don't do anything malicious.

TTY supports Baudot code, ASCII and in some places turbocode.
Approx. 95% of calls through relay services are in Baudot. 

According to a .html i had backed up on a CD, the speed for baudot
is 45.45baud (north america) speeds and protocols vary if your foreign.

Questions about the telus relay service? Direct them to telus.relay@telus.com

Keep on the lookout for future TTY projects..
I am working on some simple code to emulate baudot, perhaps an add-on to
the Hash project; www.hackcanada.com/hash.txt
