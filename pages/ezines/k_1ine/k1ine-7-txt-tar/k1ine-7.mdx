		Anyone with a Screwdriver Can Break In!



By: Jay Beale -- jay@bastille-linux.org


   August 28, 2000 - This article will discuss the second weakest layer
   of computer security, Physical Security. As we'll see, any
   attacker with physical access to a computer, a little ingenuity, and
   sufficient time can compromise the system.

   By way of example, I'll demonstrate attack and defense on a Red Hat
   Linux box and show how you might slow down, or even prevent, these
   kinds of attacks. You don't need a Linux machine, or even technical
   responsibility, for this article to be useful. This problem is
   independent of operating system and this article is general enough to
   be useful to every level of computer user. Be warned, though - you'll
   probably only be able to slow down a determined attacker.

  Breaking in Through the LILO Prompt

   If you boot a Red Hat Linux 6.x system right now, you can boot into
   single user mode like this:

     LILO:  linux single

   This will place the machine in Runlevel 1, or single-user mode. You'll
   be logged in as the superuser, root, and you won't even have to type
   in a password! This is not a backdoor, as such - this mode is
   generally used for system maintenance, which is a good idea. Requiring
   no password to boot into root here is probably a bad idea!

   You can fix this by editing /etc/inittab. Insert the following line,
   right after the "initdefault" line:

     ~~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin

   This will require a password to boot into single-user mode by making
   init run sulogin before dropping the machine to a root shell. sulogin
   requires the user to input the root password before continuing.

   So, what if we've password-protected single-user mode? Well, you can
   still have root on the machine if you type:

     LILO:  linux init=/bin/bash

   This boots the Linux kernel, but runs the Bourne-Again-Shell (bash) as
   the first (non-kernel) process, in place of init. Since the kernel
   runs init as the root user, this shell is run as root. You now have an
   instant rootshell!

   OK, so how do we stop this and attacks like it? We really should
   restrict who gets access to the LILO prompt.

   LILO permits this, natively. First, we can password-protect the LILO
   prompt, so an attacker can't add options to the LILO prompt without
   typing a password. To add a password to the LILO prompt, just choose a
   password, and place the following lines in the top of the
   /etc/lilo.conf file:

     restricted
     password=SOME_PASSWORD_YOU_CHOOSE

   We can also protect the LILO prompt by setting the delay time to 1
   millisecond, providing an attacker with insufficient time to add
   options[34]2. You can accomplish this by editing /etc/lilo.conf and
   then re-running lilo. Comment out any lines that read "prompt" by
   placing a # in front of them. Then insert the line:

     delay=1

   near the top of the file. Once you're done, make sure to re-run lilo
   to effect your changes, by typing lilo at the root prompt. Type man
   lilo and man lilo.conf to learn more about the LILO Linux [kernel]
   Loader.

   OK, so we've secured lilo - have we completely locked an attacker out
   of superuser access? Sadly, we haven't, because an attacker with
   physical access can...

   Boot Via a Floppy/CD-ROM/Other Bootable, Removable Medium

   Well, if your computer has a floppy or CD-ROM drive, an attacker can
   usually boot the system from a bootable floppy/CD-ROM. I carry around
   a Tom's Root Boot disk in my laptop case, for occasions where someone
   forgets their root password (or a machine is too munged to boot
   properly). I boot the system from my Linux floppy disk, and then mount
   the drive, like this:

     # mkdir /jay
     # mount /dev/hda5 /jay
     # vi /jay/etc/passwd
   
   Since I booted with my own floppy disk, I'm root on the machine. If
   the drive isn't encrypted, I can mount it (as above), edit the passwd
   file, and create myself a root equivalent account, by adding a line
   like this:

     jay::0:0:Security Admin:/:/bin/bash

   This creates a non-passworded root-equivalent account named
   'jay'. From here, I can repair the damage to the box, delete
   the account and go about my business.

   Unfortunately, an attacker can use the same technique illegitimately
   to quickly root a box. We can prevent this, initially, by restricting
   the machine to booting only off the hard drive. This technique is
   useless if the computer won't boot off a floppy/CD-ROM.

   You can generally configure boot options via your computer's
   battery-backed NVRAM, EEPROM, CMOS, or such. On Intel x86 hardware,
   turn your machine off and then, as it boots, press whatever key (Esc,
   F1, F2...) puts you into your BIOS's configuration menu. Now, when the
   option is saved, try to boot off a floppy. This should be impossible.

   OK, so now an attacker can't simply insert a floppy disk to root the
   box, nor can he get easy access through the LILO prompt. Does he have
   other methods? Of course! He can...

   Remove the Boot Device Restrictions!

   A knowledgeable attacker, upon finding that he can't boot from
   removable media, will simply follow the same procedure you just did,
   simply changing the boot device list back! Well, we can combat this,
   but you should be seeing two primary effects:

    1. Stop less knowledgeable attackers by knowing just a little more
       than them.

    2. Slow down and deter the knowledgeable attacker.

   We'll talk about these later - I just didn't want you to lose hope
   halfway through the article...

   So, the attacker can undo the change we just made to your system's
   boot restrictions. Well, most systems, including Intel-based hardware,
   allow you to set a password on the NVRAM, EEPROM, CMOS or whatever.
   This is an easy option to find, yet still an easy one to neglect.
   Place a password on your system's BIOS.

   This, combined with the options above, will stop a large percentage of
   attackers dead in their tracks. The remaining few might...

   Remove the BIOS/NVRAM/.../CMOS Password!

   OK, our attacker is annoying. He's also burning plenty of time. If he
   can get sufficient access, he might be able to use a tool to discover
   the BIOS password from inside Linux. Usually, he can't do this.

   Instead, since he has physical access, he can take the simpler
   approach. On Intel hardware, the CMOS/BIOS configuration is maintained
   via a small battery, often similar to a watch battery. If you
   disconnect this battery for a few moments, the RAM blanks, and the
   system forgets its password.

   While some systems then default to a manufacturer's password, there
   are online tables of these which our attacker can probably consult
   and/or partially memorize.

   What do we do here? Well, we can place a lock on the case, so it can't
   be easily opened. With time, and tools, these locks can be picked or
   broken. Further, the attacker might be able to compromise the lock by
   harming the case directly... Still, the lock (and strong case) will
   slow him down and may deter him to the extent that he leaves. Further,
   you might just remove the floppy drive, CD-ROM drive, and any other
   external drive/disk mount ports (Zip disk, parallel port...). What
   then?

   Remount the Hard Drive on Another Machine!

   Remember our mounting trick with the floppy disk from earlier? This
   can be applied from another host! While this may seem impractical,
   I'll note that I saw a deck-of-cards-sized computer just a few weeks
   ago, at DefCon, that could be used for this very purpose. Boasting a
   340MB hard disk, with a Red Hat Linux install and a free IDE port,
   this ultra-portable computer could be used easily for this purpose.

   Just plug the hard drive into this system or another system you've got
   control of, and you've got somewhat-less-that-quick superuser access.
   All we need, generally, is a screwdriver to open the target machine to
   get at the hard drive! Again, the case locks can help here, but they
   only serve to slow down a determined attacker.

   So, suppose we're still working on stopping the determined attacker.
   This guy is a total pain. The physical access makes the machine weak!

   So, what if we could remove the physical access? We place the machine
   in a locked room, with a steel door, hinged on the inside, with
   multiple non-trivial locks. Only the monitor, mouse and keyboard are
   accessible. We're truly safe now, right?

   Well, don't start patting yourself on the back just yet. Check those
   walls. Most of you secure your server rooms behind walls that don't 
   quite go up past the ceiling... What do I mean, you ask? Consider the 
   ceiling tiles around the room. Push one up, right near your inter-office
   walls, and you might find plenty of crawl space over that wall into your 
   "secure" server room.

   Once, when I locked myself out of my own office, I was told to use
   this space to unlock the door from the inside. Most offices don't
   think about this design in their physical security audit!

   OK, OK, I'm getting a little outrageous by now, yes? Eh, it really
   depends on how "secure" you need your computers to be. As I hope I've
   shown, it truly is difficult to stop an attacker who has time and
   unsupervised physical access to your computers. So, what do you do?

   Remove the Opportunity and Deter the Attacker

   You really can stop most attackers, simply by not providing them with
   the unsupervised opportunity and time required to carry out an attack.
   If you followed the path our attacker might take, you'd note that all
   of this took time. He had to reboot the host several times. This all
   takes time.

   If you harden the LInux LOader (lilo) sufficiently, set boot device
   restrictions and secure the method of changing such, our attacker will
   be getting into the realm of opening his target computer's case,
   possibly defeating locks along the way.

   While this part takes time, it's also highly likely to be noticed by
   anyone monitoring the area. If you've given physical access because the 
   target is in a computer lab, you can hire a lab monitor to watch for 
   anything this noticeable. If the physical access is accidental/unintended, 
   you can look into door locks, alarm systems, and perhaps even guards.

   In any case, now that you understand the dangers, you'll be able to
   think about this problem more carefully and choose the measures that fit
   your organization.

   Not Really a Losing Battle?

   OK, so, against a determined attacker, with sufficient time and no
   supervision, you've got little chance, right? Well, not quite. Most
   attackers don't quite think of all of these methods, or don't have the
   time/energy/wherewithal to apply them. Further, I would think that
   most attackers wouldn't choose a method that might be so 
   time-intensive, when they can be caught on the scene.

   So, work to foil all but the most capable attacker with the steps
   above. Secure the operating system boot loader, the physical boot loader 
   (BIOS...) and the hardware itself. The few attackers left will require 
   lots of time to break in, which, along with fear of being caught, will 
   often provide an ample deterrent.

   Really, deterring the attacker is the name of the game for many of us.
   If we could get anywhere near to making a computer impossible to break
   into, it would be considered fairly unusable by most. So, we
   compromise. We remove all of the "easy" methods of breaking in, like
   the 30-second LILO: linux single or boot floppy "exploits"
   demonstrated above.

   We try to go as many steps further as we can, without disrupting
   normal use. If we can make our machines enough of a pain to root, most
   attackers will go after someone else. The remainder we'll have to try
   to catch or deter with other methods, like security systems and lab
   monitors.

   In the end, always remember, the attacker is a human being, with
   plenty of potential for creativity and brilliance. Don't underestimate
   him/her!

   Good luck!

   Footnotes

    1. The absolute weakest layer of computer security is widely believed
       to be the social, or "people," layer. Crackers like Kevin Mitnick
       often broke in simply by calling users, pretending to be system
       administrators, and asking said users for their passwords.

    2. By the way, Bastille Linux can perform both of these steps for
       you. (Wink, wink, plug, plug)

                    A moonless night awaits my journey
                   into the unknown, surrounded with the
                 terrifying sounds of silence and the thick
                   spring air thinking of careless times
                   and childhood freedom just to realize
                 the horror of times hold on humanity
                   as it ticks by; no stars to wish upon
                  desperately awaiting her smile, endless
                     travel through the overgrown path
                    sweat trickling down as nervousness
                     takes over the thought, breathing,
                     gasping, going nowhere, suddenly a
                         wind passes by my soul and
                       I start to shiver, droplets of
                       water begin to fall, showering
                       sounds take over the silence,
                   still walking this path, ending where
                     I began, I felt a warm moss touch
                    my back. Fear ran down my spine, but 
                   alas, a hand touched mine, and gently
             whispered "I'm here, I'll walk with you from now on." 
                     My heart filled with happiness, 
                  and as the sun came, I saw her smile.

		Hacker Hypocrisy; @Stake/L0pht

- 09/05/00 -

RE: SecurityFocus News: AtStake jilts Phiber Optik
http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/article.html?id=79


  You know, in regards to @Stake I really don't know what to think.
Here we are [in the] the year 2000 talking about "hacker hypocrisy" and
what happens to a group of people (L0pht) who, until just recently stood
for something pure in our hacking sub-culture.

What happened?

When a multi-million-dollar venture capital is offered to a group of
people, who for the better part of the 90's relied on donations and
t-shirt/cd sales, and eventually, computer security consulting jobs to
break even -- well of course they're going to take it. I mean, who wouldn't
turn down a nice comfortable corporate career doing what they love?

WHO would of thought that a group who were so respected in the hacking
scene go about screwing over both of their own; Space Rogue (in June) and
now Phiber Optik? The same group who were once going against the grain,
doing their part for our culture and at the same time maintaining a 
certain amount of respect have now sold out in a big big way.

It's one thing to take on a well paying job, but it's another to have it
interfere with what you love to do and have it ruin the friendships that
were built over the years.

Maybe it's me ranting about something I really don't know anything
about... disappointed in a group who I looked up to for so many years as
"heros of the information age" - maybe it's the rebellious generation-X
all grown up?

Whatever it may be is irrelevant now -- the damage has been done, it
doesn't look like @Stake is bowing to hacking culture in any way at all.

---

The L0pht is no more, HNN is now very heavily saturated by the bureaucracy
of @Stake stockholder value rather than fair media reporting, and now it
seems they want nothing to do with any hacker convicted of ... hacking?

   Assign area codes or prefixes to rate bands:


   There are a total of 100 3-digit memory locations that may be used to
   assign special area codes and/or prefixes to a particular rate band
   (*00 thru *12). These 3-digit memory locations are 000 thru 099.

   You may first create a rate band containing charges and time limits you
   want (see rate bands), and then assign an area code or area code/prefix 
   in a particular 3-digit memory location from 000 thru 099.
    
   Enter # after the last number if the area code and/or prefix is less
   than 7 digits. Then enter your rate number for the particular rate
   band you created and enter # to confirm.

Introduction;

  Rogers/AT&T (Canada) offers to its customers, a particular service plan 
known as the "ROGERS/AT&T Pay-As-You-Go Wireless Plan". This "plan" entitles 
you to full local, national, and international wireless service within the 
coverage areas that it offers (see www.rogers.ca for coverage info).

In order to make use of the pre-paid wireless service, 
		you must firstly sign up by: 


1. Dialing one of the following toll-free numbers from a landline phone; 
   (Between 8:00am-9:00pm weekly, 8:00am-6:00pm Saturdays and holidays)
   
   1-800-663-1415 - British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba
   
   1-800-268-7347 - Ontario  
   
   1-800-361-0538 (1-800-ROGERS AT&T) - Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,
                                        Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland

			     OR

2. Walk into any Rogers/AT&T store or certified dealership and sign up there.
   Want to order over the phone or need help finding the nearest dealership?
   Call: 1-888-448-7994

			     OR

3. Buy 'Pay-As-You-Go' online:
   http://www.rogers.ca/wireless/english/voice/pay/buy/index.html


Pre-Paid Cards;

By going to any Rogers/AT&T wireless store location, you can pick yourself
up one of many different Pay-As-You-Go cards. What I usually buy are the $25 
1-hour cards because their cheap and I'm not really huge on talking on tumor
causing insecure radio transmitter/receivers. 


Activating your Card;

After purchasing your pre-paid card, what you can do is call up one of the 
INWATS number listed above (from a landline) that services your local area
and speak to one of the friendly customer service representative who'll
be MORE than happy to help you out. Tell them that you just purchased a
pre-paid card and that you'd like them to renew the time to your phone.


Re-filling your time;

Either buy another Pay-As-You-Go card from a Rogers/AT&T dealership, 
call them up and pay with your credit card, OR see step 3 [above].

 The Vulnerability - as a scenario.

- Johnny picks up his wireless Rogers/AT&T pre-paid phone and turns it on

- Johnny hears a beep, looks at his phone and notices that he has a lot of
  battery power left - Johnny feels glee and lets out a huge *sigh*

- Johnny then proceeds to dial his boyfriend Frank's phone number

- Johnny prepares to listen to the beautifully sounding automated female 
  recording (that makes him for a moment in his very homosexual life want
  to be heterosexual just so he'd know what it was like to actually lust
  for such an angelic voice) read off the number of minutes he has left
  for his call (account balance). 

- Too bad for Johnny; no automated voice at all! "What duth dith mean?"
  lisps the very gay, confused, and curious Johnny.


Well Johnny, what just occurred was simple; 

The Rogers/AT&T's Pay-As-You-Go billing system didn't recognize your account,
therefore you weren't billed for that particular call. Each time the automated
voice plays, you're billed for the call - each time it doesn't, you aren't.
I've estimated (with my personal experience) that the billing errors occur
approximately 40% of the time while 60% of the time the billing goes through
absolutely fine.


One good easily exploit this vulnerability by;

Hanging up the call every time the automated voice appears on the phone, 
re-dialing the desired number and repeating the process until the automated 
voice doesn't appear.

Simply only pay for one $25 Pay-As-You-Go card and keep exploiting the 
Rogers/AT&T system, calling any number you wish in the world for absolutely 
free! No one gets billed, no one is hurt. 

Leech off the capitalist pigs while you still can!

		  A Guide to General Packet Radio Service



Written by: PsychoSpy and The Clone
Date: Sunday September 3, 2000



GPRS (short for General Packet Radio Service) is a data service upgrade for 
GSM networks. This allows GSM Networks to be completely compatible with the 
Internet. GPRS uses a packet-mode technique to transfer traffic in bursts. 
These bursts allow higher efficiency, and therefore higher speeds. The packet 
bursting technique is also used in DSL modems, and other methods of high-speed 
internet access. Due to this technique GPRS allows bit rates of 9.6 Kbps to 
anywhere more than 150 Kbps per user.

There are a couple major benefits of using GPRS. These include better use of 
radio/network resources and a completely transparent support of IP. 
Radio resources are only used when data is being sent and/or received.

GPRS also provides an immediate connection (again like DSL or Cable) and
a high throughput. It also allows end user applications to only occupy
the network when data is being transferred, and is an almost perfect
design for the short data burst which data applications seem to have these
days.

Applications based on standard protocols (data) like IP and X.25 are supported. 
Four different quality of service levels are supported by GPRS. To supports 
data apps, GPRS uses several new network nodes in addition to the GSM PLMN
network nodes. 

They are responsible for traffic routing, and various other internetworking 
functions with other, external, packet-switched data networks (can anyone
say Datapac?), subscriber location, cell selection, roaming and all the
other functions which all cellular networks need to operate.

Now that we have the general info on what GPRS is, I will talk about a few 
other protocols which are linked with GPRS.

NS
~~

NS (Network Service) transfers the NS SDUs between the SGSN (serving GPRS
support node) and BSS (Base station system). There are several services
which are provided to the NS user. They include:

   Network Congestion Indication - The Sub-Network Service (i.e. Frame Relay)
perform congestion recovery control actions. The network service uses
various congestion reporting mechanisms which are in the Sub-Network
Service implementation.

   Status Indication - Is used to tell the NS user of NS affecting events. 
An example is a change in the capabilities of transmission.

   Network Service SDU Transfer - Allows network service primitives. 
This lets transmission and reception of upper layer protocol data units
between the BSS and SGSN. NS SDU's are transferred in order of the
Network Service, but under certain circumstances order might not be maintained.

The NS PDU format is:
                   
		        1 byte 
              |----------------------------|
	      |        PDU Type            |
              |----------------------------|
	      | Other Information Elements |
              |----------------------------|


The PDU Type can be any of the following:
NS-ALIVE
NS-ALIVE-ACK
NS-BLOCK
NS-BLOCK-ACK
NS-RESET
NS-RESET-ACK
NS-STATUS
NS-UNBLOCK
NS-UNBLOCK-ACK
NS-UNITDATA

Next we're onto the Information Elements (IEs) of the PDU. The IEs which are 
present depend on what the PDU type is. The structure of an IE is as follows:
                       
		        1 byte 
              |------------------------------|
	      | Information Element ID (IEI) |
              |------------------------------|
	      |       Length Indicator       |
              |------------------------------|
	      |   Information Element Value  |
              |------------------------------|


The first 8th (or octet) of an information element, having the TLV format, 
contains the IEI of the IE. If the IEI is not known to the PDU, the receiver 
assumes that the next octet is the first octet of the length indicator.
This rule is used to allow the receiver to skip unknown IEs to analyze
any other following elements,

Next up is the length indicator. This varies in length, and can be either one
or two octets long. However, the second octet may not be present. This
field has the field extension bit, 0/1 ext, and closely following it is
the length of field in octets. 

The 8th bit of the first octet is reserved for the field extension bit. 
If the field extension bit is set to zero, the second octet of the length
indicator is present. If it is set to one, then the first octet is the
final octet of the length indicator.

Lastly, the IE Value. The following IEs can be present, but are, once again, 
dependent on the PDU type:

Cause
NS-VCI
NS PDU
BVCI
NSEI


BSSGP
~~~~~

The primary functions of the BSSGP are:
- Provision by an SGSN to a BSS of radio related information used by the 
  RLC/MAC function (in downlink)

- Provision by a BSS to an SGSN of radio related information from the RLC/MAC
  function (in uplink)

- Provision of functionality to allow two physically distinct node, an SGSN 
  and a BSS, to operate node management control functions.

The BSSGP PDUs format is:

		        1 byte 
              |----------------------------|
	      |        PDU Type            |
              |----------------------------|
	      | Other Information Elements |
              |----------------------------|

LLC
~~~

The LLC (Logical Link Controller) defines the logical link control later
protocol to be used for (packet) data transfer between the MS (Mobile
Station) and a serving GPRS support node (SGSN). 

LLC goes from the MS to the SGSN and is intended to be used for both 
acknowledged and unacknowledged data transfers.

LLC's defined frame formats are based on the ones defined for LAPD and RLP. 
Although, there are major differences between other protocols and LLC, in
particular to frame delimitation methods and transparency mechanisms.
These differences are necessary for independence from the radio path.

Two methods of operation are supported by LLC. These are:

- Unacknowledged peer-to-peer operation
- Acknowledged peer-to-peer operation

All LLC layer peer-to-peer exchanges are in frames of the following format:

		           1 byte 
              |------------------------------|
	      |            Address           |
              |------------------------------|
	      |            Control           |
              |------------------------------|
	      |          Information         |
              |------------------------------|
	      |              FCS             |
              |------------------------------|

The address field contains the SAPI and identifies the DLCI which a downlink 
frame is intended and the DLCI transmitting an uplink frame. The length
of the address field is 1 byte, and has the following format:
   
      _______________________________
Bit   |   8      7     56      4-1   |
      |------------------------------|
      |   PD    C/R    XX      SAPI  |
      |------------------------------|

 -  The protocol discriminator (PR) shows whether a frames is LLC or belongs to
    a different protocol. LLC frames have the PD bit set to zero. The frame is 
    treated as invalid if its PD bit is set to 1.
    
 -  The C/R identifies a frame as either a command or response. The MS side 
    sends commands with the C/R bit set to zero, and responses with it at 1. 
    The SGSN does the opposite (commands are sent with C/R set to 1, and
    responses are set to 0). 
 
 -  The XX bit is a reserved bit.

 -  Service Access Point Identifier (SAPI) identifies a point where KKC 
    services are provided by an LLE to a layer-3 entity.

After the address, comes control. This identifies the type of frame. 
There are four types of control field formats. They are:

   - Confirmed information transfer (I format)
   - Supervisory functions (S format)
   - Unconfirmed information transfer (UI format)
   - Control functions (U format)

Next is the information bit. This contains various commands and responses.

The FCS (Frame Check Sequence) field consists of a 24-bit cyclic redundancy 
check (CRC) code. CRC-25 is used to detect bit errors in the frame header
and information fields.


SNDCP
~~~~~

SNDCP (Sub-Network Dependent Convergence Protocol) users the services provided 
by the LLC Layer, and SM (Session Management) sub-lay. The four main functions 
of SNDCP are:

- Multiplexing of several PDPs (Packet Data Protocol)
- Compression/Decompression of user data
- Compression/Decompression of protocol control information
- Segmentation of a network protocol data unit (N-PDU) into LLC     
  protocol data units (LL-PDUs) and re-assembly of LL-PDUs into a 
  N-PDU


Data transfer is acknowledged by the SN-DATA PDU. The format of the SN-DATA 
PDU is:

       8     7     5     6           4-1        
    |-------------------------------------------|
    |  X  |  C  |  T  |  M  |       NSAPI       |
    |-------------------------------------------|
    |        DCOMP          |       PCOMP       |
    |-------------------------------------------|
    |                                           |
    |                    Data                   | 
    |-------------------------------------------|


The SN-UNITDATA PDU (used to Acknowledge data transfer) has a format 
as follows:

       8     7     5     6           4-1        
    |-------------------------------------------|
    |  X  |  C  |  T  |  M  |       NSAPI       |
    |-------------------------------------------|
    |        DCOMP          |       PCOMP       |
    |-------------------------------------------|
    |     Segment offest    |    N-PDU Number   |
    |-------------------------------------------|
    |  E  |         N-PDU Number (Cont'd)       |
    |-------------------------------------------|
    |                                           |
    |                     Data                  |
    |-------------------------------------------|


NSAPI (Network Service Access Point Identifier. The values of this field may 
be any one of the following: 

   0 | Escape Mechanism for Future Extensions
 ----|--------------------------------------------------
   1 | Point-to-multipoint multicast (PTM-M) information
 ----|--------------------------------------------------
 2-4 | Reserved for future user
 ----|--------------------------------------------------
 5-15| Dynamically allocated NSAPI value
 ----|--------------------------------------------------


M is the more bit. It's values may be:
 ----|-------------------------------------------------------
   0 | Last Segment of N-PDU
 ----|-------------------------------------------------------
   1 | Not the last segment of N-PDU, more segments to follow
 ----|-------------------------------------------------------

The T bit, SN-PDU type specifies whether the PDU is SN-DATA (0) or
SN-UNITDATA (1).

C is the compression indicator. If set to 0, the compression fields DCOMP 
and PCOMP are not included. While 1 tells that these fields are included.

X is the spare bit. This is always set to 0.

DCOMP (Data Compression Coding) is included if the C-bit is set. 
DCOMP values are:

 ----|--------------------------------------------
   0 | No Compression
 ----|--------------------------------------------
 1-14| Points to the data compression identifies 
     | negotiated dynamically
 ----|--------------------------------------------
  15 |Reserved for future extensions
 ----|--------------------------------------------



PCOMP (Protocol Control Information Compression Coding) is included if the 
C-bit is set. The PCOMP Values are:

 ----|--------------------------------------------
   0 | No Compression
 ----|--------------------------------------------
 1-14| Points to the protocol control information
     | compression identifier negotiated dynamically
 ----|--------------------------------------------
  15 |Reserved for future extensions
 ----|--------------------------------------------


N-PDU Number
0-2047 when the extension bit is set to 0.
2048-524287 if the extension bit is set to 1.


RLP
~~~

The Radio Link Protocol (RLP) is used to transmit data over the GSM PLMN. RLP
covers the functionality of Layer 2 of the ISO OSI Reference Model. It
has been tailored to the needs of digital radio transmissions and provides
an OSI data link service. It also spans from the MS (Mobile Station) to the 
interworking function, which is located at the nearest MSC (Mobile
Switching Center) or even further. There are currently three versions of RLP:

Version 0 is a Single-link basic version,
Version 1 is a Single-Link extended version,
And Version 2 is a Multi-link version.

RLP frames are fixed in length. The frame can either be 240 or 576 bits. 
The frame consists of a header, information field, and an FCS field.

The format of the 240-bit frame is:
  _____________________________________
  | Header  |  Information    | FCS    |
  |---------|-----------------|--------|
  | 16 bit  |  200 bit        | 24 bit |
  |---------|-----------------|--------|
  | 24 bit  |  192 bit        | 24 bit |
  |---------|-----------------|--------|

The header is 16 bits in versions 0,1, and in the U frame of version 2. 
It is 24 bits in the S and I+S frames of version 2.

The format of the 576-bit frame is:
  _____________________________________
  | Header  |  Information    | FCS    |
  |---------|-----------------|--------|
  | 16 bit  |  536 bit        | 24 bit |
  |---------|-----------------|--------|
  | 24 bit  |  528 bit        | 24 bit |
  |---------|-----------------|--------|

The header is 16 bits in version 1 and in the U frames of version 2. 
It is 24 bits in the S and I+S frames of version 2.

The header contains control information. This control information can be any 
one of three types:
1) Un-numbered protocol control information (U frames)
2) Supervisory Information (S frames)
3) User Information Carrying Supervisory information piggypacked (I+S Frames)

The FCS (Frame Check Sequence) field in the RLP is just like the FCS which is 
used in LLC which was discussed earlier.

RLP can be either in Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM) or Asynchronous 
Disconnected Mode (ADM). ABM is the data link operation mode, while ADM
is the data link non-operational mode.

Now we're going to get into some, maybe, confusing diagrams. The following 
diagram shows the Structure of Versions 0 and 1.

N(S) is a bit 4 low order bit, and N(R) bit 11 low order bit.

Bits 1-16 are as follows:
     ___________________________________________________________________________
U   | C/R | X  | X  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | P/F | M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 | M5 | X | 
    |     |    |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |     |    |    |    |    |    |   |
    |-----|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
S   | C/R | S1 | S2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | P/F |            N (R)           |
    |     |    |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |     |                            |
    |-----|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|----------------------------|
I+S | C/R | S1 | S2 | 0   1   N   1   1   1 | P/F |            N (R)           |
    |     |    |    |         (S)           |     |                            |
    |-----|----|----|-----------------------|-----|----------------------------|



version 2

S is a L2R status Bit, N(S) is a bit 1 low order bit, N(R) is a bit 14
low order bit and UP is a UP bit.

   Bits 1-24
    ___________________________________________________________________________
U   | C/R | X | X | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | P/F | M1  | M2  | M3 | M4 | M5 | X |   
    |-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|-----|----| ----|---------|   |----|
S   | X   | X | X | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | P/F | C/R | S1 | S2 |  N(R)       X UP |
    |-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|-- |-|-|-----|-----|----|----|----------------|-|
I+S |                   N(S)            | | P/F | C/R | S1 | S2 |  N(R) S UP     |
    |-----------------------------------|-|-----|-----|----|----|----------------|


The C/R (Command Response) bit shows whether the frame is a command or a
response frame. It can have only one of two values:

1    Command
0    Response

The P/F (Poll/Final) bit shows a special instance of the command/response
exchange.

The X bits don't really matter.


In the Unnumbered Frames (U) the M1 M2 M3 M4 and M5 bits can have any
of the following values in the U frames depending on the type of information
carried.

SABM   11100
UA     00110
DISC   00010
DM     11000
NULL   11110
UI     00000
XID    11101
TEST   00111
REMAP  10001


SABM == Set Asynchronous Balance Mode 
        SABM is used to initiate a link for a numbered information transfer
        or to reset a link already established.

UA == Unnumbered Acknowledge
      UA is issued as a response to acknowledge a SABMM or DISK command.

DISC == Disconnect
        DISC is used to disestablish a previously established link information
        transfer link. (duh!)

DM == Disconnect Mode
      DM Encoding is used as a response message

NULL == NULL

UI == Unnumbered Information
      UI says that the information f field is to be interpreted as unnumbered
      information.

ID == Exchange Identification
       ID signifies that the information field should be interpreted as
       exchange identification, and is used to negotiate and/or renegotiate
       parameters of RLP and Layer 2 relay functions.

TEST == TEST
        This shows that the information field of the frame is test information.

REMAP == REMAP
         This signifies that a remap exchange takes place in ABM following
         a change of channel coding. If an answer is not received within
         a specified time then the module end enters ADM.


In the S and I+S Frames the following are present:

N(S) == Send Sequence Number
        N(S) contains the number of the I frame.

N(R) == Receive Sequence Number
        N(R) is used in ABM to designate the next information frame to be
        sent and to confirm that all frames upto and including this bit
        have been correctly received.

S == L2 Status Bit
     S1 and S2 bits can have the following significance in the S and I+S
     frames.

     RR 00
     REJ 01
     RNR 10
     SREJ 11

RR == Receive Ready
      RR can be used as a command OR a response. It clears any previous
      busy condition in that area.

REJ == Reject Encoding
       REJ is used to show that in numbered information transfer, 1 or more
       out of sequence frames have been received.

RNR == Receive Not Ready
       RNR shows that the entity isn't ready to receive numbered information
       frames.

SREJ == Selective Reject
        SREJ is used to request a retransmission of a single frame.

UP is used in version 2, to indicate that a service level upgrade will
increase the throughput.


   [- {GTP} -]

 The GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) is the protocol between GPR
Support Nodes (GSNs) which allow multiprotocol packets to be tunnelled
through it in the GPRS backbone network. These packets are the collection
of data that carry one of two substantial pieces of information; 
either the user's IP or X.25 packets. Below GTP, the standard protocols
(TCP or UDP) are employed to transport the GTP packets within the GPRS
backbone network. X.25 expects a reliable data link to be used, thus why TCP
is occupied for data transfer. UDP, is simply used for special access to
IP-based packet data networks, which don't necessarily expect reliability
in the network layer. IP is employed in the network layer to route specific 
packets through the GPRS backbone. Please note; Ethernet, ISDN, or
ATM-based protocols may be used below IP for GTP packeting.

Lets summarize shall we?

In the GPRS backbone we have an IP/X.25-over-GTP-over-UDP/TCP-over-IP 
transport architecture. Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Protocol -- 
The Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Protocol (SNDCP) within the
signalling plane, specifies a tunnel control and managment protocol which
allows the SGSN is used to transfer data packets between the Serving GPRS
Support Node (SGSN) and the Mobile Station (MS). 

Its functionality includes:

* Compression and decompression of user data and redundant header information.

* Multiplexing of several connections of the network layer onto one
  virtual connection in the underlying Logical Link Control (LLC) layer.

(Definition; Logical Link Control (LLC): a data link layer protocol for GPRS.
This layer assures the reliable transfer of user data across a wireless 
network.)

- In the signaling plane, GTP specifies a tunnel control and management 
  protocol which allows the SGSN to provide GPRS network access for a MS.

- Signaling is used to create, modify and delete tunnels.
  In the transmission plane, GTP uses a tunneling mechanism to provide a 
  service for carrying user data packets. The choice of path is dependent 
  on whether the user data to be tunneled requires a reliable link or not.

- The GTP protocol is implemented only by SGSNs and GGSNs. No other
  systems need to be aware of GTP's presence. GPRS MSs are connected to an
  SGSN without being aware of GTP. It is assumed that there will be a
  "many-to-many" relationship between SGSNs and GGSNs.

- A SGSN may provide service to many GGSNs. A single GGSN may associate with
  many SGSNs to deliver traffic to a large number of geographically diverse 
  mobile stations.

GTP header structure 

The GTP header is a fixed format 16 octet header used for all GTP
messages. Below is a simple diagram of the GTP header structure, hopefully
this will give you a general idea of the relevancy of GTP headers.


                             8  7  6   5 - 2 1
                            Version Reserved LFN
                                Message type
                                   Length
                              Sequence Number
                                 Flow Label
                              LLC Frame Number
                           x  x  x  x  x  x  x  FN
                                  Reserved
                                     TID

                            GTP header structure 

		GTP Header Structure; Definitions
		---------------------------------

- Version: Set to 0 to indicate the first version of GTP

- Reserved: Reserved bits for future use, set to 1.

- LFN: Flag indicating whether the LLC frame number is included or not.

- Message Type: Type of GTP message.

- Length: Indicates the length in octets of the GTP message (G-PDU).

- Sequence number: Transaction identity for signaling messages
  and an increasing sequence number for tunneled T-PDUs.

- Flow label: Identifies unambiguously a GTP flow.

- LLC frame number: Used at the Inter SGSN Routing Update procedure
  to coordinate the data transmission on the link layer between the
  MS and the SGSN.

- x: Spare bits x indicate the unused bits which are set to 0 by the
     sending side and are ignored by the receiving side.

- FN: Continuation of LLC frame number.

- TID: Tunnel identifier that points out Mobility Management and
  PDP contexts.
  
   
                   The format of the TID is as follows:

                                5 - 8  4 - 1
                          MCC digit 2 MCC digit 1 
                          MNC digit 1 MCC digit 3 
                          MSIN digit 1 MNC digit 2
                          MSIN digit 3 MSIN digit 2
                          MSIN digit 5 MSIN digit 4
                          MSIN digit 7 MSIN digit 6
                          MSIN digit 9 MSIN digit 8
                            NSAPI MSIN digit 10


TID Format:

MCC, MNC, MSIN digits

Parts of the IMSI (defined in GMS 04.08).

NSAPI: Network service access point identifier.



 [- {GMM} -]

 GMM

 What is GMM? GMM, or GPRS Mobility Management is a very complex versatile
protocol that operates within the signaling plane of GPRS handing such things
as: roaming, authentication, and selection of encryption algorithms.
The main function of the GMM sub-layer is to support the mobility of user
terminals, such as informing the network of its present location and providing
user identity confidentiality.


			  GMM header format:

   8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Octet
   Protocol discriminator Skip indicator 1
   Message type 2
   Information elements 3-n

                            
		    GMM header structure; Definitions
	            ---------------------------------

   Protocol discriminator - 1000 identifies the GMM protocol.

   Skip indicator - The value of this field is 0000.

   Message type - Defines the function and format of each GMM message.

   The message type is mandatory for all messages. Bit 8 is reserved for
   possible future use as an extension bit. Bit 7 is reserved for the
   send sequence number in messages sent from the mobile station.

GMM message bit types:

   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1             Attach request
   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0             Attach accept

Conclusion;

   PsychoSpy and I wrote this document as a guide for anyone desiring
to learn more about the future of GSM wireless. Within the next
couple of years, I guarantee you'll be seeing a vast number of GSM-type
phones in Canada (FIDO provider) offering the high-speed GSM add-on
technology known as GPRS. So when GPRS is released by 2002, you won't be
left out in the cold wondering "now how the hell did they do that?"
because you would of read this document!

What to look for in the future in regards to our R&D:

- A look at GPRS administration, configuration and security analysis

- CDMA Protocols; CC, MM, BSSMAP, DTAP (GSM-L3), RR, BTSM, BSSAP

- SS7 Protocols; MTP2/MTP3, SCCP (v2.0), TCAP ISUP, TUP, DUP

           Tuesday August 23rd - Miklos' Adventure at Graybar
        --------------------------------------------------------

	Schools coming around shortly, and I haven't had much luck finding 
drains in my dismal city.  However, I have kept my eye on a construction site, 
for the new home of a very successful electric wholesaler, Graybar. A couple 
months pass and I see that construction is coming together with some 
interesting things for me to check out.  
	It is now 21:00 on August 23rd, and I pump myself up to travel solo, 
and explore the building.  I have no car, so I pack up my backpack and begin 
walking to the building.  When I arrived, I quickly made my way to a pile of 
girders.  I hid behind the girders until traffic eased up, so no one could see 
me enter the building.  The building is centrally located around residential, 
light industrial, and a lighted baseball field 500 meters away from this 
building.  A few minutes pass, and I quietly slip into the building.  In front 
of me are hundreds of girders, wall panels, and blocks of concrete.   The 
building has 2 floors, the ground level, and an upstairs.  The ground level 
so far is spilt into 2 sections.  The section I entered was the offices, and 
such.  The other section is a huge space to load trucks, and hold inventory.
	I crawled along against the wall of the office part of the building 
(to aviod being spotted by traffic) I entered the larger section of the 
building.  whoa.  There wasn't even a concrete floor yet, just a huge 4 
walled, gravel floored building.  As I started going through this room, I 
saw a light "shit!"  I backed-up against the wall, quickly turned off the 
maglite, and waited for the light to go away.  Then, I heard an engine noise, 
and some guy yelling.  I was unsure at the moment what to do, so I waited for 
the guy(s?) to leave.  After 15 minutes of some more yelling, the car finally 
left, and so did I, back to the office section of the ground level.
	I searched around the office section of the building, not finding much, 
and made my way towards the stairs.  Again, I layed low against a wall until 
the traffic lightened up so I could go up the stairs un-noticed by motorists.  
The second level hasn't been done yet, but I could still move around up
there. I walked mostly along planks to get a look at rest of the
building.  The upstairs didn't offer much for me, except a nice view of
the entire building from above.  
I looked around for ladders, or anything else to get me higher..
	Success!  I found a 30-foot ladder to would take me to the roof!  I 
quickly scaled the ladder, and got up on the roof.  It was a nice site.  I 
walked around up on the roof, and tried to take a picture of the city.  
Unfortunately, the picture turned out bad, as did most of the pictures that 
night.  Anyhow, I had a nice, cool breeze against my face up on the roof, and 
decided to chill out and watch the night scenery for a bit.
	Afterwards, I went back down the ladder, down the stairs to the 
ground level and left the building.  At this point in time, I didn't even care 
if anyone saw me on the site, cause I was leaving.  I put the camera, my 
maglite, and streetchy gloves into my backpack, and started my journey
back home. I pulled out my music, and strolled home to witness a
beautiful lightning storm, and get a bit wet from the rain.
	So concludes my adventure at Graybar.  For a pictorial version of 
this, check out: http://www.haxordogs.net/ghu/ue/ex/graybar.htm .  See
you in the next installment of Urban Exploration.
