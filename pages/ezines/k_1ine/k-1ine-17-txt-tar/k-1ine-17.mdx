  - Introduction:

   Weoooo!@#, it's that time again - fo attdah issue of K-1ine 'zine. I've been
having a great fuckin' summer... went to Def Con (#9) once again this year
(see: www.nettwerked.net/Nettwerked_Movie.html) and met a ton of cool people,
and a couple uncool people. I helped Pinguino with the Flippersmack table
and we managed to help spread da word about Flippersmack AND K-1ine zine. The
minute I came back from Vegas, I hopped on my computer and checked my e-mail; had
an INBOX full of about 20 messages from the people I met -- checked the K-1ine mailing
list and saw that over 30 people had joined my list makin' my total subscriber number
to over 100. 

I apologize for not having a lot of articles for you all this month, but I suppose I
have an excuse. ;-)

Enjoy and contribute something!

DEF CON 9 UPDATE:

 Scavenger Hunt Winners
   The winners were the "A-Team" which consisted of Circuit, Random Dent,
   and Fantom. Second place was "Exxodus" with Siviak, Wolfe, Banshee,
   and Texorist. They won original artwork and items from different
   vendors at DefCon.

(... personally I thought the Exxodus team would win. After Banshee
 stripped completely naked in front of me (the judge) I would have
awarded it to her team. Anyways... congrats to the A-Team on the victory ...)

  disclaimer: Do not attempt following exploit. Having telco security 
              after you isn't a fun experience. If you attempt this
              exploit and do get caught, I am in no way responsible.

  intro: This document has been written to point out another payphone
         vulnerability that I recently discovered while experimenting
         with two types of COCOTs: the Canada Payphone Corporation / AT&T
         'Elcotel Eclipse', and the Paytel Canada 'Protel'.


  documentation;

 For over two decades, payphone companies have been working ways to make
their payphones more profitable, user-friendly, and secure both in the area
of physical security (to protect from vandals) and line-security (to protect
from phone phreakers).

Starting in the late nineteen-eighties, payphone companies have started to be
successful in stopping the exploitation of their phones by people using
blueboxes, redboxes, beige boxes, and more recently NOS (not in service) 
INWATS numbers for unrestricted line dropping.

In western Canada, where Telus has a monopoly over the payphone market, Telus
has successfully been able to patch the unrestricted line problem. For example:
you pick up the receiver on a Telus payphone, dial a toll free number (800)
and the number you dialed happens to be out of service and hangs up on you;
the payphone will automatically recognize this and seize the phone line.
 
However, I've found that in the last two years that certain COCOTs have been
vulnerable to line seizing exploitation. In March of 2000, I found that a large
portion of the older AT&T Elcotel model 9520c's tend to have a lot of problems
with seizing not-in-service calls. Line seizing exploitation on Elcotel 9520C's
now looks as though it is virtually extinct because a majority of the older and
all of the newer 9520C's have now been fixed by Canada Payphone Corporation
(Elcotel's Canadian distributor).

"Just when AT&T, Elcotel, Canada Payphone Corporation, and Paytel Canada 
        thought the days of line seizing exploitation was over..."

1. In order to make this particular exploit work, you need to call an 
   out-of-service/hanging number such as this one: 1-800-909-0261.

2. After the call connects, you will hear the line hang for approximately
   15 seconds.

3. Now wait for another 5-10 seconds, and the line you called will hang 
   and supervise.

4. At this point the vulnerable phone you are on will try to seize the line
   and make you redial the number. Instead, you will get a normal dial tone.

5. Immediately after getting the dialtone on the phone, enter any area 
   code and any number you wish to call; local or long distance.

6. Your call will connect as if you had placed 25 cents into the payphone,
   and directly dialed the number.

 Q: "What does my caller identification information
     show on the received party's CID display?"
   
 A: If you called from any Paytel Canada COCOT, your CID info will show
    "Paytel Canada" and its assigned phone number. If you call from an
    Elcotel Eclipse COCOT, your CID information will show "Unknown Name"
    and its assigned phone number.

outro:

This file just goes to prove that one of the many exploits
that worked on the payphones of yesterday DO still work on
newer payphones of today, and likely tomorrow if COCOT manu-
facturing and distribution companies don't get a clue as to
how their own payphone equipment works. 

How long is it going to be before these telecom companies
start adopting some sort of a standard for properly securing
POTS-copper lines? Until then, phreaks around the nation will
continue to exploit this ancient form of toll-fraud that hurts
these companies revenues by millions of dollars each fookin' year!

		  Def Con 9, Destination: home

by: p_bang


For those of you that haven't heard, (or have not seen the Nettwerked 
Movie), I seemed to have made an appearance at Defcon 9 this year.  During 
the drunken ordeal, my wallet got stolen, and this is the short version of 
how I managed to travel back to Canada.

Anyways, thanks to KK and Myself (rubi-con boys from Detroit),  I got to the 
airport Monday morning, and the fun began...


Got to the airport, had to get on my knees and BEG for a boarding pass. 
(they don't like you not having id)

Plane was delayed 3 hours because SanFran was fogged over

Had to beg AGAIN for a boarding pass to Vancouver, this time I was downright 
pissed off (they HATE giving boarding passes to anonymous people on 
international flights.)

plane was delayed 3 hours because of fog

plane's external lights were not working (electrical?) delayed another hour

plane's 'air-tight' seal on door was not working (can someone say 
"oxygen-mask"?) delayed another FIVE (5) HOURS!!!   -did I really want to 
board this flight? No.

Plane CANCELLED because of 'technical issues' - Thank God.

Finally, after midnight, we board, and take off.  This plane at least had 
headlights, and a door that wouldn't suck me out into the darkness.

around 2:00 or 3:00 - we land in Vancover.

Ooh, my favourite:  Customs.

"What do you mean, you don't have any ID?"
"My wallet got stolen, don't fuck with me. I'm not in the mood."
"Excuse me, while I call my boss, I've never handled this type of situation 
before"
"Go for it."
--five minutes later, and with security guards surrounding me--
"Sir, you are going to be checked into 'immigration'."
"Sure, but can your goons come with me?  I feel insecure without them."
"They are here to protect my Country."
"YOUR Country?  I pay for your salary.  Think about me when you get laid off 
because of cutbacks."
--five minutes of being 'escorted' later--
"Sir, where do you work?"
"Advanced Network Technologies."
"So, uh, you went to school for that here in Vancouver?"  -insert sarcastic 
tone here
"Nope.  I went to school in Alberta."  -(note: Vancouverites hate Albertan 
rednecks)
"Whatever. You are free to go"
--five minutes later.  goon-free.--

I walk up to the "high-security area" - basically where they shove stuff up 
your ass, put your socks through the x-ray machine, and do chemical 
analysis' of your hat.   I have two options: 1. Get fucked over by mounties 
with rubber gloves, x-ray machines, and screwdrivers, or 2. walk through the 
small door marked "diplomats".

A quiet alarm sounds when I open the door.

"Sir, do you know what this door is for?"
"It's late, I'm pissed-off, and Yes."
"Ok, let's see your papers"
(at this point, I hand the lady a sheet of paper that is used for flights 
into Canada. Written in the name is "Bill Gates" and no other line is 
written on, except for a large "APPROVED" stamp that immigration hastingly 
signed)

"Sir, what is in the bags?"
"High-security, I cannot tell you that"
"Ok, go ahead"

At this point, I could not help but laugh as I was escorted past the rubber 
gloves, metal-detectors, and goons.  I had gotten away with it, and was 
finally in freedom again.

The situation was perfect, then reality hit.

It is 4:00 in the morning.
I am in Vancouver (I live 3 hours away)
I have no wallet (stolen at defcon)
I have $15 US

Damn, what a bitch.

Anyways, I found a Television normally used for flight schedules, and being 
the hacker that I am, I decided to change the channel.

Shit. It worked.

So there I was, curled up in an airport with "Super Chanel" blaring into the 
darkened, empty, airport.  Good night.

8:00am I awaken. Tired, pissed-off, and hungry.

I go to buy 1. a pack of smokes (high-priority) 2. Coffee (just as high) 3. 
food (If you've ever met me, you'd think I didn't know what this stuff is)

Numbers 2 and 3 were not a problem.  Smokes, on the other hand, eluded me. 
For a while.

"Export-A Light, please"  (a Canadian brand of smokes)
"Let me see some ID, sir."  (What's with this 'Sir' thing?)
"Don't fuck with me. If you had any idea what I've been through these couple 
of days, I would not even be paying for them"
"If you don't show me some ID, you WON'T be paying for them, or receiving 
them, either!"

This was not good.

I turn around, hand the guy behind me $6, and say, in a sarcastic, 
pissed-off voice: "Export-A Light!"

30 seconds later, I was enjoying my cigarette, and making my large, 
cardboard sign that read:

"Wallet got stolen.
No money.
I want to go home.
Please help."

It only took me about half-an-hour, and many pissed off people later, to get 
the $53 I needed to get a bus-ride home.

Home, sweet, home.

		Caller ID Basics

	Caller ID On Call Waiting
	Conclusion

	Bibliography


		Executive Summary

Caller ID (CID), or Calling Number Delivery (CND) as it is sometimes called, came about as
an extension of Automatic Number Identification (ANI).  ANI is a method that is used by telephone
companies to identify the billing account for a toll call.  Although ANI is not the service that
provides the information for CID, it was the first to offer caller information to authorized parties. 
The CID service became possible with the implementation of Signaling System 7 (SS7).

The CID information is transmitted on the subscriber loop using frequency shift keyed (FSK)
modem tones.  These FSK modem tones are used to transmit the display message in American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) character code form.  The transmission of the
display message takes place between the first and second ring.  The information sent includes the
date, time, and calling number.  The name associated with the calling number is sometimes
included also.  Since the time CID was first made available it has been expanded to offer CID on
Call Waiting (CIDCW) as well.  With CIDCW the call waiting tone is heard and the identification of
the second call is seen.

The purpose of this paper is to gather information from multiple sources dealing with CID
and to present that information in a manner such that the reader can gain a basic understanding of
CID and its operation.

		Introduction

Although several articles about Caller ID have been written, the most complete information
and definitions are still contained within Bellcore specifications.  By combining general information
from some of these articles with the specifics from the Bellcore specifications this paper will give a
better basic understanding of CID in one central source.

Caller ID is the identification of the originating subscriber line.  Although Caller ID is the
most common name for the service, a more appropriate name would be Calling Number
Identification since it is the directory number of the originating line that is used as the identification. 
In cases where the name and the number are sent, the name that is used is that which is
associated with the number in the directory listing.  The telephone company has no way of
knowing who the actual caller is.

The CID information is sent on the destination subscriber loop between the first and second
ring by means of two modem tones.  The information is transmitted serially in FSK mode using one
of the tones to represent a logic 1 (mark) and the other to represent a logic 0 (space).  Caller ID
uses the same frequencies, modulation type, and data format as the Bell type 202 modems[1].

The message consists of a Channel Seizure string followed by a Mark string and then the
caller information.  The information is sent in one of two formats.  The Single Data Message
Format (SDMF) contains the date, time, and calling number.  The Multiple Data Message Format
(MDMF) contains the date, time, calling number, and the name associated with that number. 
Optionally, the number and name fields may contain data indicating that the information has been
blocked by the caller or is unavailable.


		Background

The method for sending and displaying the CID information during a silent interval between
rings was invented by Carolyn A. Doughty.  This invention was filed for a United States Patent on
July 12, 1983.  It was assigned patent number 4,582,956 on April 15, 1986 with AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories (now Lucent Technologies Incorporated) listed as the assignee.[2]

Caller ID was first offered in New Jersey in 1987 by New Jersey Bell[3].  The telephone
company was interested in trying to earn additional revenue from its investments in new high-speed
network signaling systems[4].  These new systems use a separate call data circuit based on the SS7
standard to handle the setup, termination, supervisory signals, and other data concerning a call.
This separate call data circuit can handle the processing of multiple calls very quickly and eliminates
certain types of toll fraud[5].

Prior to SS7 telephone companies used ANI for call billing purposes.  With only a few
exceptions, the billing information about the caller was not sent beyond the central office that
provided that caller's service.  The exceptions to this were authorized parties such as 911 services,
law enforcement agencies, and more recently 800 and 900 number subscribers.  Even today, ANI
is still used by these parties[5].  Since ANI is completely independent of CID it will deliver the
originating number even when the originator has blocked their number for CID purposes.

With the installation of the new SS7 systems it became practical to forward the calling
party's identification through the telephone network to the central office serving the called party. 
This aspect of SS7 is known as Calling Party Number Message (CPNM).  The CPNM includes the
calling party's telephone number, and whether or not the calling party wants their number blocked
from being seen by the called party.  Note that the CPNM is sent out on all telephone calls that are
made, regardless of whether or not the calling party wants their number blocked[5].

A major issue that came up with the offering of CID was that of privacy.  In several states
the implementation of CID was slowed by privacy advocate groups.  These groups claimed that CID
was an invasion of privacy.  In April of 1994, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
issued a ruling that established a national standard for CID and the delivery of the caller's number
into the switched network.  Local and long distance telephone companies that were equipped to do
so had to exchange CPNMs.  Along with this, the telephone companies had to offer blocking on a
per call basis so that the caller could block their number from being delivered to the called party[4]. 
The CPNM is still delivered to the final central office serving the end subscriber, but the number is
then blocked and the CID message marked as private.

		Specifics

Caller ID, as it is most commonly called, is a term that encompasses more than one type of
caller identification.  Calling Number Delivery refers to the most basic type of CID.
It is delivered in SDMF and includes the date, time, and calling number.  Calling Name Delivery (CNAM)
is an enhancement of Calling Number Delivery that adds the calling name and is sent in MDMF.

Bellcore has stated that a possible future objective may be to phase out the SDMF and use
only the MDMF.  In the event that SDMF is phased out, the name field in a MDMF message would
be left out for customers who subscribe to number delivery only[6].

The CID information is sent serially at a rate of 1200 bits per second using continuous-phase binary
frequency shift keying for modulation.  The two frequencies used to represent the binary states are
1200 Hz for the Mark (logic 1) and 2200 Hz for the Space (logic 0).  The data is sent asynchronously
between the first and second ring at a signal level of -13.5 dBm.  The level is measured at the central
office across a 900 ohm test termination[7].

Following a minimum of 500 ms after the end of the first ring, the sequence of transmission
begins with a Channel Seizure.  The Channel Seizure is a string of 300 continuous bits (250 ms) of
alternating &quot;0&quot;s and &quot;1&quot;s.  This string starts with a "0"; and ends with a
"1".  A Mark Signal of
180 mark bits (150 ms) is sent immediately following the Channel Seizure Signal.  The purpose of
the Channel Seizure Signal and the Mark Signal is to prepare the data receiver in the Customer
Premise Equipment (CPE) for the reception of the actual CID message[7].

Once the Channel Seizure and Mark Signals have been sent the CID information is then
transmitted starting with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the most significant character.
This is true for both SDMF and MDMF[6].  Each character in the message consists of 8 bits.
For displayable characters these bits represent a code defined by the American Standard Code for
Information Interchange.  When transmitted the character's 8 bits are preceded by a start bit
(space) and followed by a stop bit (mark) giving a total of 10 bits sent for each character.  The CID
information is followed by a checksum for error detection[7].  


		Figure 1 - Sequence Layout and Timing

The checksum word is a twos complement of the modulo 256 sum of each bit in the other
words of the message.  The Channel Seizure and Mark Signals are not included in this checksum. 
When the message is received by the CPE it checks for errors by taking the received checksum
word and adding the modulo 256 sum of all of the other words received in the message.  The
addition done by the CPE does not include the Channel Seizure and Mark Signals, nor does it
include the received checksum word.  The result of this addition should be zero to indicate that no
errors have been detected[8].

Figure 2 shows a CID message in SDMF.  For ease in describing the process of determining
the checksum, the decimal values will be used for the calculations.

		Figure 2 - A Caller ID message in SDMF

The first step is to add up the values of all of the fields (not including the checksum).
In this example the total would be 945.  This total is then divided by 256.  The quotient
is discarded and the remainder (177) is the modulo 256 sum.  The binary equivalent of 177
is 10110001.  To get the twos compliment start with the ones compliment (01001110), which
is obtained by inverting each bit, and add 1.  The twos compliment of a binary 10110001 is
01001111 (decimal 79).  This is the checksum that is sent at the end of the CID information.
When the CPE receives the CID message it also does a modulo 256 sum of the fields, however it
does not do a twos complement.  If the twos complement of the modulo 256 sum (01001111) is
added to just the modulo 256 sum (10110001) the result will be zero.

If the result is not zero then the message is discarded.  It is important to note that there is
no error correction in this method.  Even if the CPE were to notify the central office of errors, the
central office will not retransmit the information.  If an error is detected, the CPE receiving the
message should display an error message or nothing at all[8].  Although Bellcore SR-TSV-002476
recommends that the CPE display an error message if erroneous data is received, most CPE
manufacturers have elected to just ignore the errored message.

The content of the CID message itself depends on whether it is in SDMF or MDMF.  A
message in SDMF includes a Message Type word, a Message Length word, and the actual
Message words.  A message in MDMF also includes a Message Type word, a Message Length
word, and the actual Message words, but additionally includes Parameter Type and Parameter
Length words.  There are certain points within these messages where up to 10 Mark bits may be
inserted to allow for equipment delays in the central office[7].  These Stuffed Mark bits are
generally not necessary.

The Message Type word defines whether the message is in SDMF or MDMF.  It will be a
binary 00000100 (decimal 4) for SDMF or a binary 10000000 (decimal 128) for MDMF.  The
Message Length will include the number of characters in the message.  This length does not
include the checksum at the end of the message.  For SDMF the minimum length will be 9
characters.  The minimum length for MDMF will depend on whether the customer has subscribed to
CNAM service as well as CND.  In the case of CND only the minimum length will be 13 characters. 
If the customer also has CNAM then the minimum will be 16 characters.  In all three of the
minimums mentioned there will be no actual number or name delivered.  The field will be marked
either "O" (Out of area) or "P" (Private)[6].

Figure 3 shows an example of a minimum message layout for SDMF.  The number will not
be delivered because it has been blocked by the calling party.  The CPE will receive the date, time,
and a "P" to indicate that the caller's identification has been blocked at the caller's request.

	Figure 4 - A CID message in MDMF

In Figure 4, if the number and name had not been included then the parameter types for
those fields would be different.  These alternate parameter types are used to signify that the data
contained in that parameter is the reason for its absence.  The parameter type for the number
section would have been a binary 00000100 (decimal 4) and the parameter type for the name
section would have been a binary 00001000 (decimal 8).  When the parameter type signifies that
the data contained is the reason for that fields absence, the parameter length is always a binary
00000001 (decimal 1).  If the reason for absence is that the calling party does not want their
number/name displayed then the parameter data would be a binary 01010000 (ASCII "P") for
Private.  If the reason for absence is that the information is just not available then the parameter
data would be a binary 01001111 (ASCII "O") for Out of area[9].  The number/name may not be
available if the calling party is not served by a central office capable of relaying the information on
through the network.

		Caller ID On Call Waiting

In carrying CID a step further and combining it with Call Waiting, a service commonly
called Caller ID on Call Waiting has been developed.  This feature is also sometimes called Calling
Identity Delivery on Call Waiting.  With CIDCW the identification of the party calling can now be
seen without putting the current call on hold.  CIDCW is done the same way as CID with only a
few exceptions.  One of those exceptions is that CIDCW only uses MDMF so the message type will
always be a binary 10000000 (decimal 128).

Since CIDCW will only take place if a call is already in progress there will never be a ring
signal preceding the message.  The channel seizure signal is not used with CIDCW either.  The
central office gets the CPE's attention by sending it a CPE Alerting Signal (CAS), a two-tone signal
described later.  If the customer's equipment is ready to receive the CID information, it responds to
the CAS by sending the central office an acknowledgment (ACK) signal.  Note that the CPE will
only respond to the CAS signal if it is the only extension that is off-hook[10].  If someone else is
involved in the call on another extension, the CPE will not send an ACK signal to the central office
because it cannot mute the second device.  Most manufacturers detect whether an extension is
off-hook by monitoring the line voltage.  If the line voltage drops below a certain point then it is
assumed that an extension is off-hook.  This can lead to problems in situations where the CPE is
placed on a very long loop.  The long loop reduces the voltage at the CPE and causes its detector
to continuously register an extension off-hook.  At least one manufacturer is getting around this by
designing the equipment to learn the line voltage that it should see during normal operation.  This is
done by taking the device off-hook two or three times so that it can register the normal off-hook
voltage.  If the voltage ever drops below this setting, it assumes that there is another extension
off-hook.  Once the central office sees the ACK signal it sends the FSK data[10].

When the CPE sees the CAS from the central office it mutes the telephone's handset
before sending the ACK and receiving the FSK data.  This act of muting serves two purposes. 

First, it keeps the telephone user from hearing the FSK signal.  But, more importantly it avoids
interference from speech and other noises that would be picked up by the telephone's microphone. 
The muting only has to take place on the end receiving the FSK data since before sending the CAS,
the central office momentarily removes audio to and from the far end of the current call.  The audio
is reconnected after the FSK data has been transmitted[8][10].

The sequence of events that displays the information about the caller begins when the
central office temporarily removes the far end party of the current call and sends a Subscriber
Alerting Signal (SAS) to the near end party.  The SAS is a single frequency of 440 Hz that is
applied for approximately 300 ms.  This is the tone that is heard when a call is in progress and call
waiting beeps to indicate a second call.  The SAS tone is mainly for the user and is not required for
the CPE to receive the CID information.  The SAS tone is followed by a CAS to alert the CPE that it
has CID information to send.  The CAS is a dual tone signal combination of 2130 Hz and 2750 Hz
that is 80 ms in length.  Once the CPE hears the CAS it mutes the handset of the telephone and
returns an ACK signal to the central office.  This ACK signal has a nominal tone duration of 60 ms
and is either a Dual-Tone Multifrequency (DTMF) &quot;A&quot; or a DTMF "D".  The DTMF "D" is the most
common ACK signal and it consists of the frequencies 941 Hz and 1633 Hz.  A DTMF "A" consists
of the frequencies 697 Hz and 1633 Hz.  Once the central office receives the ACK signal it in turn
sends the CID information[7][8][10].  The CPE un-mutes the handset as soon as it finishes
receiving the FSK signal.

A problem that is sometimes experienced with CIDCW is Talkoff.  Talkoff occurs when
the CPE falsely detects a CAS.  Speech can sometimes be interpreted by the CPE's detector as a
CAS from the central office[8].  When talkoff occurs both parties will hear a brief interruption in the
conversation and the party on the far end will hear the ACK signal that is sent to the central office
by the CPE.  When the handset is muted by a talkoff, the CPE will timeout and un-mute the
handset after waiting a set period of time for an FSK signal[11].  Bellcore SR-3004 specifies that
this timeout period should be no more than 501 ms from the end of the ACK signal.  A CPE's
detector will behave differently with different people because of the variations in each persons
voice and speech patterns.  Speech can also cause a valid CAS signal to not be recognized by the
CPE.  When this occurs, it is called a Talkdown.

The last difference between CID and CIDCW is that instead of being preceded by the 300
bits of Channel Seizure Signal and 180 bits of Mark Signal, as with standard CID, the Caller ID
message for CIDCW is only preceded by 80 bits of Mark Signal[8].  CIDCW still uses the checksum
just like CID.


		Conclusion

Although CID can be very useful in screening calls, it is not limited to this application
alone.  For example, a number of business contact-manager software packages have made it
possible to use CID to automatically bring up client information from a database and display it on
the screen of a personal computer (PC) before the call is answered.  Implementation of this requires
a CID hardware device with a data connection to the PC.  As time goes on we will see more and
more uses for CID.  Even though an "Out-of-Area" message may still seen occasionally, it will be
less and less often as the remaining telephone offices which are not yet setup for CID install the
necessary equipment.

Even as there are advances being made in the way Caller ID can be utilized, there are also
advances being made in the customer premise equipment.  Manufacturers are now coming out with
units that allow multiple extensions to be off-hook and still receive CIDCW.  Although the same
manufacturer's equipment must generally be used on all extensions, this does allow more than one
person to be on the same call and still see the identification of a waiting call.  Even the small office
key telephone systems are now offering CID and CIDCW capabilities so that caller information
coming in on a line can be displayed at all stations associated with that line.  Implementation does
not always mean replacing a currently installed telephone system.  Some manufacturers are
offering upgrades to existing hardware by simply replacing specific printed wiring cards.
