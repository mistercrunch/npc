           A Canadian Pager Carrier Billing Flaw

  Disclaimer: This documentation is for entertainment and informational purposes
              only. In no way do I recommend you try any of these things, because
              it may get you in trouble with your phone company. However, if you
              do choose to attempt to exploit this little Canadian pager
              vulnerability; use a payphone, an automated divertor, op divert,
              use an outdial, or beige box someone's phone line. Oh yeah, and
              I'm not responsible for anything you do with this information. If
              you get caught defrauding the telco, it is because you're a fucking
              idiot who didn't take the precautions to stay anonymous.
          -

  Introduction: Pagers have brought many people together through a variety of
                signaling format protocols - POCSAG, FLEX, GOLAY - transmission
                speeds of 512, 1200, 2400 bps?! Standard Numeric, Alpha-Numeric,
                Tone Pagers? Oh the variety, oh the fun!

                Word on the street says that American and Canadian carriers are
                looking into phasing out pagers in the next couple of years.
                Hell, I even received some promotional material from Telus
                Mobility offering me cheap CDMA service if I cancelled my pager
                service through them! Apparently pager systems cost a lot to
                maintain, and over the last few years, less people even bother
                to use pagers due to the simple fact that wireless phones offer
                so many great features - Two Way Communication, Voice Mail,
                Short Message Service, Games, High Speed Data Transfers (GPRS
                and 1X), E-mail, Internet, and more. No freaking wonder pagers
                are on their way out, and cell phones continue to grow in
                popularity. However, until pagers are completely wiped out,
                this paper will still be very relevant.

	 FACT: Wireless Carriers in Canada do not want customers to know the
               low-tech and high-tech tricks / exploits that let people abuse
               their service and use it to make free calls.

	-

	    The Canadian Pager Carrier Billing Flaw:

    As you may or may not be aware, Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility do not
    have any type of billing system set up that logs direct or third party
    billing to their residential / business customers -- I have verified this
    claim with over 5 different customer service agents for both wireless
    carriers.

    Since Bell and Telus do not log any billing, they have come up with a
    simple and effective way to stop people from billing pagers; all major
    carriers in Canada share an "access list" of exchanges, prefixes and
    suffixes that block all Canadian long distance carriers from billing to
    any Canadian pagers.

    To test this flaw out for yourself, call up Telus' "Canada Direct" number
    at 1-800-646-0000 and enter any random pager number; you'll likely hear a
    message saying something to the effect of: "The number you have dialed
    cannot accept direct/3rd party billing." However with a little
    experimenting, I noticed that many American long distance carriers do not
    block a Canadian pager from receiving a direct or third-party charge. The
    reason for this is because these companies don't have any of our updated
    access lists.

    ! An unrelated note to Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility: Duh, stay outta
      Riverdale!

    How to set this up:


   Before you do anything, you need to set yourself up a pager that allows you
   to record a voice-greeting.
 
   There are a few ways in which you can do this...

   1. Use your own pager or a friends pager. In understandable English, set the
      voice greeting to say "yes" for approximately 25 to 30 seconds. Speak
      slowly and pause for about half a second between each "yes".

   2. Hack into a pager. Most users have their remote admin pager pins set as
      "1234", "9999", "5555", the current year (2002), or the last four digits
      of their pager phone number. For most Telus Mobility pagers, the default
      password is the last four digits of the customer's unique 'capcode'. The
      capcode is a series of numbers at the bottom of the label, below the
      Model, Serial Number, Country Code, and ISC code.

   
   The "Fun" part:

   Once you have successfully set up the pager greeting, you'll need to test
   out this billing flaw. Make sure you don't get a live operator to authorize
   your billing. Instead, use a service that has an automated billing operator.
   A good resource to utilize is Yahoo!'s 'Business and Economy' web-page which
   has a great alphabetical listing of various American long-distance carriers
   that you can exploit. The address for that listing is:

http://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/Communications_and_Networking/Telecommunications/Long_Distance_Telephone/

   --
  

  Conclusion:

  Although this trick was fairly simple and this file wasn't the most technical
  of articles I've ever written, the fact of the matter is: everyone assumes
  that pagers (like cellular phones) are never vulnerable to fraud, or that
  pager billing systems are not without their major billing flaws. This file
  certainly changed all of that, now didn't it? :)

The Forth Programming Language - Why YOU should learn it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The forth programming language is radically different from conventional
programming languages. It bears little resemblance to C, Java, Pascal,
Lisp, Python, etc. This short article will not attempt to teach you the forth
language, but instead give you a taste of what forth has to offer, give
you a general idea of what the language is, and point you in the direction
of various forth resources.

The forth programming language was originally formalized in the early
70s by Chuck Moore, but it's beginnings predate that by several years,
mostly as a small, specialized programming platform for various systems.
After forth began to become more well known, 2 driving forces instantiated
to promote forth use: Forth, Inc. and the non-profit Forth Interest Group
(FIG). Forth had a brief stint with popularity after microcomputers
were introduced, often being the first language to support the new
microprocessors, but soon fell into relative obscurity in mainstream
programming.

Forth is unique in that the evolution and acceptance of it has
proceeded as an entirely grassroots effort. Large industry has never
backed or supported forth, and has always driven the development and
use of more "conventional" programming languages, such as C.

With a few exceptions, forth is also unique in how diversified the language
is. Unlike, say LISP, though, there seems to be a common thread among
forths giving the community a particular unity. However, forth is the
only programming language that has a strong, vocal user community that is
actively against the ANSI standard of it's language, and chooses not to
upport it. There are many reasons for this viewpoint, none of which a
beginner will notice until they become better acquainted with the language.

Forth is built upon the belief that every implementation aspect of the
language should be as simple as possible, and that all complexity should
be built upon this base of simplicity. Forth philosphy also insists that
in extreme flexibility. This flexibility is overwhelming to many new
forth users, and often gives them a bad taste for the language.

Because of this philosophy forth programs are known for their small
codesize, low memory usage, powerful flexibility, and difficulty to
understand. :)

Forth is, at heart, a system programmer's programming language because
of it's remarkable flexibility. An endless stream of people have extended
forth to support their preferred programming and usage preferences.
Forth was, interestingly, a very early language to support Object
Oriented programming. People have added GOTO statements to forth. 
Transparent support for C structures has been added. "Local variables"
have been developped for forth (this is a hot topic in the Forth communities,
by the way). People have developed sophisticated GUIs in forth. Forth code
has run on the space shuttle.

Forth is usually considered much more than a programming language though.
It's also (sometimes) an operating system, an Integrated Development
Environment, a debugger, a run-time environment, an interpreter, and a
programming methodology.

At the heart of forth is a variable called "state". Generally, state
represents either interpret mode or compile mode, and this variable
will influence almost everything done by the system. Most forth
introductions don't find it necessary to introduce state until much
later in the learning period, but I think that the ability to flip
between compilation and interpretation mode (execution semantics)
is the most important defining feature of forth.

More visibly, forth provides the user with 2 stacks of small, fixed
cell size (typically 32 or 64 bits on modern computers). Forth provides
direct access to these stacks. This is in marked contrast to most languages.
Most languages, like C, use 1 stack of large "stack frames" that the user
is not permitted to directly access.

One interesting result of this design decision that I like to point out
to new forth programmers is that your functions (called "words" in forth
- I'll get to them) are no longer limited to returning one item.

For instance, in C, your functions may look like this:

int my_func(int x, int y) {
  ...
  return 10;
}

As you can see, this function accepts 2 arguments and returns 1.
In C, there is no way to directly return 2 or more arguments without
allocating memory and passing pointers - a procedure that can get very
messy.

In forth, you have no such restrictions. If you want to return 2
items, go ahead. If you want to return 10 items, feel free. You're even
allowed to return 3 items sometimes, and 39 items other times. It's up
to the programmer.


Forth is generally said to be an "RPN" language. RPN stands for
"Reverse Polish Notation". RPN was originally invented by a, you guessed
it, polish professor, and is an effective way of expressing arithmetical
expressions without using parenthesis.

Everything is done on a stack. Numbers are pushed down, and operators
pop the numbers and preform operations on them.

For instance, the expression

(1+3)-2

would be written like this in RPN:

1 3 + 2 -

All programming in forth is done like this. If you want to program in
forth you have to learn to "think on the stack". Meaning, you have to
keep track of the "stack effects" of your functions as well as their
purpose.


The "dictionary" is the name of the append-oriented heap where your
forth "words" are stored. A word in forth is, simply, any combination
of displayable, non-whitespace characters that represents a location in
memory, and may have certain user-defined attributes.

"Everything in forth is a word or a number". This is almost true.

The word "+" takes the top 2 values off the stack, adds them, and pushes
the result onto the stack.

You can define your own words using the word ":". For instance, if you
wanted to make a word that would take the top number off the stack, add
42 to it, and press the result back onto the stack, you might write it
like so:

: add-42 42 + ;

When ":" is executed, it puts the "state" variable into compile mode.
Anything encountered now will be compiled into the add-42 definition.
When it sees 42, it recognizes it as a number, but since the forth
system is in compile mode, it compiles 42 into the definition. Next it
compiles "+". Then it encounters the word ";" which it executes. ";"
closes the add-42 definition, and returns "state" to interpret mode.

Astute readers will be wondering why ";" was executed instead of compiled.
This is because ";" is an immediate word. Immediate words are executed
no matter what the value of state is. Immediacy is a very powerful feature
in forth. Once you understand how immediate words are used to build up
everything in the language, you will have understood the most important part
of forth, that which I will not even try to describe here.

You can, in turn, use "add-42" in interpret mode, or compile it into
other definitions:

Ex:
4 add-42 .
44   ok

: add-40 add-42 -2 + ;
  ok


Here is a good point to note the stack effects of add-42. Notice how it
takes 1 argument and returns 1 argument? This may be relatively
obvious in this function, but as your words become more complex
you will want to keep track of the stack effects. Forth programmers
often do that like so:

: add-42 ( n -- n' ) 42 + ;

The word "(" is an immediate word that will force forth to ignore everything
until a ")" is encountered. Not that ")" is NOT a word. Nor is anything
between the parens. IMPORTANT: Note that "(" is followed by a space.
This is vital. The word is "(", not "(n". So, as you can see, parens
function similarly to C's /* and */. The word "\" in forth is analogous
to C++'s "//".

The contents of the comment is what's signifigant. The text before the
"--" indicates the arguments passed to the function, and the text after 
indicates the values returned on the stack. The convention is that
the numbers closest to the left are higher on the stack.


Be careful using ":" though. If you add words that already exist in the
dictionary, the "redefined" words will not be readily accessible. Experienced
forth programmers will take advantage of this for a number of reasons, but
a beginner should be careful to avoid this.

As stated before, a word can be any combination of non-whitespace,
displayable ASCII characters. There is nothing stopping a number (called
a "literal" in forth) from being a word either.

This is perfectly valid:

: 1 2 ;

Now 1 is effectively 2, so be careful. :)
Incidentally, most forth systems define words called "0" and "1". This
is because a compiled word takes less memory than a compiled literal, and
0 and 1 are numbers used so often that signifigant memory can be saved using
this technique.


I mentioned that forth had 2 stacks. The data stack (aka paramater stack)
is the one we've been focusing on so far. The return stack is the second
kind of stack, and is used to store addresses so that after a word is
executed, forth knows where to resume execution. You can move data to
and from the return stack and the data stack with the words ">r" and "r>".1
I wouldn't suggest doing this until you understand forth more thouroughly
though.

An experienced C programmer will be able to tell you that a return address
and a function's "local variables" are stored in the same stackframe,
making it trivial to write over the return address. This particular
attribute of C has resulted in decades of insecure systems open to
anyone with enough audacity to overflow a buffer. Forth greatly
complicates this particular attack. Also, forth stores strings not
as arrays of characters terminated by a "NULL byte", but as an array
of unterminated characters and a "count" of the length of said array.
As such, there are no such equivalents to C's strcpy() and gets() in forth.
These 2 attributes make forth particularly resilient to buffer overflow
attacks. Format strings also do not exist in Forth, ruling out another
very popular attack.


The last core feature of forth is the "parse buffer". It's where your
text goes when you type stuff into forth. Normally forth parses a word
delimited by white space, moves the parse pointer ahead to the next word,
and executes the parsed word, and this continues indefinitley. When
there is no more data available, it goes into interactive mode and
accepts the words from stdin.

Words can, however, modify the parse buffer. One common word for this
is "'", pronounced "tick", which parses the next word in the buffer,
looks up that word in the dictionary, presses this address onto the stack,
and advances the parse buffer pointer. This is very useful in forth,
although I won't explain why here.


I hope this brief introduction to forth has been enough to tickle your
curiosity. Just for fun, here's a listing of the words in a fully stocked
"system" dictionary in my forth.

There are many helpful people there who will help you get started with forth.


Forth is not an especially easy language to learn when compared to
other languages, simply because it gives you complete access and control
over every aspect of the programming system. Chuck Moore once described
other languages as dampeners, and forth as an amplifier. What he meant
was that in most languages, the programming techniques are sufficiently
abstracted and set at the "lowest common denominator" that good programmers
will not do a signifigantly better job than bad programmers. Perl code is
always between "kinda good" and "kinda bad". Forth on the other hand,
amplifies the programmer's skill. A good programmer can write incredible
forth code. A bad programmer can write absolutely stinking terrible forth
code.

Regardless of your programming skill, forth is useful to learn just for
the feeling of enlightenment you'll feel when you finally "get it". I
encourage you to investigate forth further even if it just to realize that
there are other ways of programming besides C and it's derivatives.

The Great Canadian Scam of 2002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Behind closed doors, the government of Alberta must be meeting with the
large oil companies. Indeed, I can think of no other reason why a government
would act so quickly, venemously, and without concern for the well-being
of it's citizens and the environment, simply in order to protect
a private interest. Certainly, and I don't think this can be questioned by
any reasonably unbiased objective thinking, the various Albertan petroleum
corporations are in direct control of Ralph Klien and the Albertan government.

Alberta is in the middle of one of the worst droughts in recorded history,
yet the oil companies insist that implementing the Kyoto accord would be
disastrous to the economy. Ironically, *not implementing* the Kyoto
protocol could potentially result in vast amounts of long-term damage to the
Albertan economy by devasting the (sustainable) Albertan farming industry
while temporarily protecting the (unsustainable) petroleum mining industry.

The Kyoto accord may cause a change in the economy. This is true.
Wealth may be distributed from oil companies to solar or wind energy companies.
Either way, there is no real evidence to suggest that Alberta's economy will
be harmed from this agreement. 

Putting aside the economic arguments for a moment, burning fosil fuels for
energy is expensive, inefficient, polluting, and non-renewable. This energy
source could have, and should have, been entirely replaced decades ago.

This is not what I intend to talk about now, however. I intend to talk
about how the oil companies are consciously and determininately lying,
spreading fear/uncertainty/doubt, "financially influencing" public officials,
etc. with the sole goal of protecting their financial interests by molding
public opinion - with the public's own money! I don't know where you come
from, but where I come from, this is called "fraud". This incredibly audacious
scam may seem unbelievable to most. I know that I, for one, was shocked
that something like this would be allowed to happen in a relatively
free country like Canada. I intend to try to open the reader's eyes up
to what actually is happening, but I am sure that I have no real idea of the
raw power wielded by these international corporations.

The Alberta government has spent $1.5 million dollars of the public's money
in a massive television, newspaper, and radio campaign. Is it any suprise
that Albertans have undergone a "radical change of opinion" on the subject
of the Kyoto Accord? I think not. This is clearly the calculated result of
the scare campgain led by the oil companies, who (just as clearly) have
financial control over said government.

Is it any more of a suprise that an Albertan doctor was fired by the
Albertan government for speaking out for the Kyoto Protocol? Not really,
Having a public health official discuss the imminent threats that are posed
to our health if global warming continues unchecked could be very thought
provoking to a section of the population.


THE TACTIC
~~~~~~~~~~

    Since governments are the most influential institutions in lawmaking
    (by definition) ensure that lose control of the government is maintained
    at all levels. Preserve the appearance of a public controlled government
    to provide "legitimacy" to your actions.

    Ensure that the public's available information reads as is necessary for
    maintaining control over the relevant governments. Accomplish this by
    any means possible, especially by using the media's public-influence
    "services".



It's a relatively straightforward idea, and one that, understandably, gets
very little support in the mainstream media: The free market is not driven
by competition. Since competition results in lower prices, more expensive
manufacturing processes, longer lasting products, and more selective
consumers, it does not benefit any corporation's interests. Authentic
competition only results when it is mutually beneficial to the corporations.

In order to optimize this lack of competition, corporations are intimitatley
linked together at all levels of operation, and since all of them are
interested in maintaining the status quo, they cooperate in manipulating
the publics opinion to do so. 

Earlier in history, corporations would use physical coersion to enforce
ideas upon the people (think coffee trade). After the American civil war,
America began a slow and steady process of incorporation. After WWII, there
was no sector of the economy, media, or government that wasn't directly
controlled by wealthy private interests. This new era demanded a different
method of controlling people's opinions: Restriction of information. The radio
stations, television stations, book publishers, magazine/newspaper publishers,
and children's textbook publishers were all (and still are) controlled almost
exclusively by corporations. By carefully omitting pieces of information
the status quo can effectively erase facts and opinions from the public's
memory. Since all the corporations are linked together, vital pieces of
information relating to consumer information, foreign issues, and even
public health is influenced by this massive information censorship
program (think tobacco companies). 

This relates quite directly to the Kyoto issue:
The US' system of controlling public opinion has recently been taken up
by the large Canadian corporations (think Canwest). This is particularly
noticable in Alberta, where almost all services have been privatized, and
the government clearly does NOT represent the interests of the people.

Now you know the motive and the method. It's up to. Is this expensive
brainwashing campaign justified?


I urge the hacker community not to embrace corporate "culture" like the
majority of western generations before ours. The plot to kill the
Kyoto accord is just one example of how these incredibly powerful entities
are influencing your future (and the future of our planet). These entities
are not affected by borders, have no ethics, suffer virtually no
accountability for their actions, and have more money than they know what
to do with. Do you really want to trust them to choose your future?
