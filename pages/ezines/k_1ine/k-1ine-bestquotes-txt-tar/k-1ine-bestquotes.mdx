The Best K-1ine quote choices by: Tek, Kankraka

Date created: Monday, July 28, 2003


Disclaimer: THIS ISSUE CONTAINS statements about human (young and old) sex, animal sex, robot sex,
incest, drug use, violence, threats against each others lives, racism, bad spelling, and the admit-
tance of illegal activities. Don't you tell us we didn't warn you! If you're under 18, don't read
this file. Go turn on Oprah and watch that fat cow bash Alberta beef, and then get her ass sued by
the progressive conservative party! And just for the record; if you are a law enforcement officer,
you agree not to use any of the following information to pursue the guilty (or innocent for that
matter). Remember, it's only IRC, so it really isn't real life... but we like to pretend it is.

An Introduction:

It is what binds our wonderful scene together. It is more powerful than love, than money, than the
military. It holds the answers to life's greatest mysteries, and it tells greater stories than those
from Hollywood. It has been called the force, the infinity, the everything and the nothing. It knows
everything, and yet it knows nothing. It doesn't have an age, a race, a color, a creed. It resembles
the first day of summer, the view of the mountains through a kaleidoscope, and the sparkle in a child's
eye on Christmas morning. It has no friends and no enemies. Some have called it a void.

We call it K-1ine quotes!

Some shout "bring it back that old new york rap" while others (cool people) shout "Give us more K-1ine
quotes". Very well. Here you all go - in celebration of a happy K-1ine summer, Tek, Kankraka, and The
Clone bring you all the best of K-1ine quotes. We looked for the funniest, most insane quote we could
find from past issues and included it in this file. This shit is so fucked up, that we couldn't of been
able to fake it.

And yes I realize this file is completely dumb and I (The Clone) will be lucky if I don't get at least
500 flame e-mail's saying hurtful things like "K-1ine sucks now!", "K-1ine is going down the tubes...
way to go, clone!", and "DIE DIE DIE!". This isn't a fucking issue of K-1ine. It's a best of quotes
file. Yeesh.


The Categories:

The "best of" K-1ine quotes are organized in several different categories: 'Fucking Strange', 'Fucking
Stupid', 'Broken English', 'Down Right Rude', 'Kinky', 'Guess That Movie' quote, 'Insults', and a sure
pleaser; 'Never Seen Before' quotes! For the record, anything that couldn't fit in any of the aforemen-
tioned categories defaulted to "Fucking Strange". I never bothered to place a date to the quote 'cause
that's just fucking stupid and a big waste of time. If you want to track down which issue the quote was
from, then look it up yourself you lazy bastard! Mmmkay? Have fun and don't blame me if you keep pissing
your pretty pink panties from laughing so hard. whiird.
