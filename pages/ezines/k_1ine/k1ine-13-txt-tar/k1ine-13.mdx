News - Ministerial-level Summit of the Americas

	'Unveiling "NAFTA for the Americas" NAFTA + WTO = FTAA'

(HTML VERSION AT: http://www.cmaq.net/viewarticle.ch2?articleid=530)


   What is "FTAA"? The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) is the
   formal name given to an expansion of NAFTA (the North American Free
   Trade Agreement) that would include nearly all of the countries in the
   western hemisphere. This massive NAFTA expansion is currently being
   negotiated in secret by trade ministers from a total of 34 nations in
   North, Central and South America and the Caribbean. The goal of the
   FTAA is to impose the failed NAFTA model of increased privatization
   and deregulation hemisphere-wide. Imposition of these rules would
   empower corporations to constrain governments from setting standards
   for public health and safety, to safeguard their workers, and to
   ensure corporations do not pollute the communities in which they
   operate. Effectively, these rules would handcuff governments' public
   interest policymaking and enhance corporate control at the expense of
   citizens throughout the Americas. FTAA would deepen the negative
   effects of NAFTA we've seen in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. over the
   past seven years and expand NAFTA's damage to the other 31 countries
   involved. The FTAA would intensify NAFTA's "race to the bottom": under
   FTAA, exploited workers in Mexico could be leveraged against even more
   desperate workers in Haiti, Guatemala or Brazil by companies seeking
   tariff-free access back into U.S. markets. A quick look at NAFTA's
   legacy reveals disastrous consequences:

   It's estimated that over a million U.S. jobs have been lost since
   NAFTA as companies relocated to Mexico to take advantage of the weaker
   labor standards. These workers usually find jobs with less security
   and wages that are about 77% of what they originally had. The U.S.
   trade surplus with Mexico has become an $18.6 billion deficit. Despite
   promises of increased economic development throughout Mexico, only the
   border region has seen intensified industrial activity. Yet even this
   small "gain" has not brought prosperity. Over one million more
   Mexicans work for less than the minimum wage of $3.40 per day today
   than before NAFTA, and during the NAFTA period, eight million Mexicans
   have fallen from the middle class into poverty. In addition, the
   increase of border industry has created worsening environmental and
   public health threats in the area. Along the border, the occurrence of
   some diseases, including hepatitis, is two or three times the national
   average, due to lack of sewage treatment and safe drinking water.
   Although it's hard to imagine that anyone would push for more of a
   failed model like this, what little we do know about FTAA is that is
   likely to look quite a bit like NAFTA. In fact, some FTAA texts are
   reported to be literally based on NAFTA, with additional countries
   added in. We know what results to expect!
   
   Who is involved in the FTAA negotiations, and how did it get started?
   High on their NAFTA victory, U.S. officials organized a Summit of the
   Americas in Miami in December 1994. Trade ministers from every country
   in the western hemisphere (except for Cuba) agreed to launch
   negotiations to establish a hemispheric free trade deal. After the
   "Miami Summit," however, little more was done on FTAA until the
   "Santiago Summit" in Chile in April 1998. However, at this second
   summit the 34 nations set up a Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC),
   consisting of vice ministers of trade from every country and headed by
   Dr. Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini of Argentina. Negotiators also
   agreed on a structure of nine working groups to deal with the major
   areas they agreed to cover under FTAA: agriculture, services,
   investment, dispute settlement, intellectual property rights, subsides
   and anti-dumping, competition policy, government procurement and
   market access. You would never know it from news reports, but since
   late 1999, the working groups have been meeting every few months to
   lay out their countries' positions on these issues and try to develop
   treaty language.
   
   As with the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), many Members
   of Congress have no idea this is even going on. Congress has set no
   goals for the U.S.'s participation in these talks and has not
   delegated to the Executive branch its Constitutional role of setting
   the terms of international commerce. However, a variety of corporate
   committees do advise the U.S. negotiators; under the trade advisory
   committee system, over 500 corporate representatives have security
   clearance and access to FTAA NAFTA expansion documents. Organizations
   such as the Organization of American States (OAS), Inter-American
   Development Bank (IDB), and the UN Economic Commission for Latin
   America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), collectively known as the
   "Tripartite Committee," also provide direction. Early on,
   non-governmental civil society organizations (NGOs) demanded working
   groups on democratic governance, labor and human rights, consumer
   safety and the environment. These were rejected, and instead a
   Committee of Government Representatives on Civil Society was
   established to represent the views of civil society to the TNC. Yet
   this committee is little more than a mail in-box. It has no mechanism
   to incorporate civil society concerns and suggestions into the actual
   negotiations, so these are mainly ignored.
   
   The U.S. is represented by the U.S. Trade Representative's office
   (USTR), headed by Charlene Barshefsky as of November 2000. The lead
   USTR negotiator on FTAA is Peter Allgeier.
   
   What will FTAA's practical effects be? Because negotiations are
   occurring in secret and no texts have been made publicly available, we
   cannot know the details of the draft text. However, our conversations
   with the USTR have given us some clues about what to expect once a
   final agreement is unveiled -- in other words, once it's too late to
   change it!
   
   Essential Social Services Endangered: The FTAA will contain a series
   of commitments to "liberalize" services, which is much like the
   General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) within the WTO.

   "Services" is a broad category that includes education, health care,
   environmental services (which can include access to water!), energy,
   postal services and anything else we pay for that isn't a physical
   object. Possible effects of the FTAA services agreement include:
   removal of national licensing standards for medical, legal and other
   key professionals, allowing doctors licensed in one country to
   practice in any country, even if their level of training or
   technological sophistication is different; privatization of public
   schools and prisons in the U.S., opening the door to greater corporate
   control, corruption and the temptation to cut critical corners (such
   as medical care for inmates or upkeep of safe school facilities) in
   the interests of improving profit margins; and privatization of postal
   services transferring U.S. Postal Service functions to a few delivery
   companies like FedEx, which could then send postal rates through the
   roof.
   
   Investment and a Backdoor MAI: FTAA NAFTA expansion provides a
   potential "back door" for the Multilateral Agreement on Investment
   (MAI), through negotiations focused on investments and in the
   financial services sector. We didn't call the MAI "NAFTA on steroids"
   for nothing! MAIN is based on NAFTA and direct NAFTA expansion is just
   another way to impose these rules. Like in NAFTA's Chapter 11, the
   USTR says that FTAA will include "investor-to-state" suits. These
   allow corporations to sue governments directly for the removal of
   standards or laws designed to protect public health and safety, which
   may cost the corporations a little more in operating costs. In other
   words, the FTAA would provide a hemispheric "regulatory takings"
   clause that explicitly values corporate profits over human costs.
   NAFTA cases that set a likely precedent for FTAA actions under this
   provision include:
   
   The Canadian funeral home chain Loewen Group used NAFTA investor
   protections to sue the U.S. government for $750 million in cash
   damages after a Mississippi court found Loewen guilty of malicious and
   fraudulent practices that unfairly targeted a local small business.
   (NAFTA permits companies to sue governments over rulings or
   regulations that may potentially limit their profits.) Loewen argues
   that the very existence of the state court system violates its NAFTA
   rights. The U.S.-based Ethyl Corporation forced Canada to pay $13
   million in damages and drop its ban on the dangerous gasoline additive
   MMT, a known toxin that attacks the human nervous system. Other
   regulations protecting public health and the environment remain open
   for attack under NAFTA and FTAA. In a similar case, U.S.-based
   Metalclad Corp. sued a Mexican state to allow a toxic waste disposal
   site, claiming that the environmental zoning law forbidding the dump
   constituted an effective seizure of the company's property a seizure
   that, under the property rights extended by NAFTA (and to be
   perpetuated in FTAA), requires that the offending government
   compensate the company.
   
   Food, Agriculture & GMOs: The U.S. is trying to force all countries to
   accept biotechnology and genetically modified (GM) foods in which
   unregulated U.S.-based corporations have taken a lead. Yet food
   security organizations all over the world agree that these
   technologies will increase hunger in poor nations. Being forced to buy
   expensive patented seeds every season, rather than saving and planting
   their own, will force traditional subsistence farmers in the
   developing world into dependency on transnational corporations and
   closer to the brink of starvation. If the U.S. position wins out, FTAA
   will promote the interests of biotech and agribusiness giants like
   Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Cargill and Monsanto over the interests
   of hungry people in developing nations.
   
   Intellectual Property Rights (IPR): The U.S. is trying to expand
   NAFTA's corporate protectionism rules on patents to the whole
   hemisphere. These rules give a company with a patent in one country
   the monopoly marketing rights to the item throughout the region. These
   rules are enforced with cash fines and criminal penalties, making
   these rules even harsher than the WTO IPR rules. These rules have been
   used as justification for pharmaceutical companies to quash compulsory
   licensing mechanisms to allow competitor companies to manufacture a
   drug in exchange for a fee for "renting" the patent. This monopoly
   control allows pharmaceutical corporations to keep drug prices high
   and block production of generic versions of life-saving drugs, which
   spells disaster for the ill and impoverished, especially in developing
   nations. These rules also allow companies to "bioprospect" and lock
   down patents for traditional medicines that are considered
   "traditional knowledge," effectively robbing indigenous people of
   their cultural heritage to fatten corporate wallets.
   
   What is the current status of the FTAA negotiations? All the
   negotiating groups have held meetings at two to three month intervals
   throughout 2000. Negotiators have laid out the positions of their
   governments on the nine core issues. As of fall 2000, they are in the
   process of consolidating proposed text to find points of agreement
   among the governments. A complete "bracketed" (draft) text will be
   ready in December 2000. Vice ministerial level meetings on FTAA NAFTA
   expansion will begin in early 2001. The next ministerial-level Summit
   of the Americas is planned for Quebec City, Canada on April 18-22,
   2001, at which negotiators will start building a whole text.
   The agreement is to be complete and implemented in 2005.

		Myth: The U.S. has a liberal media.


Sat, 03 Mar 2001

Look at the programming. Sitcoms portray liberals as normal and anyone
not extreme left as either an idiot or evil.  Find one example to the
contrary and anyone here can easily point out 6 to back me up. Look at
the commentaries, same thing. Even in pop commentary, shows like
"Politically Incorrect" regularly have three or four leftists and a
single conservative to attack while pretending to be balanced. Look at
the ratings vs commitment. Helen Degenerate's show had to drop below
Sunday morning informercials and stay there for months before they
even considered canceling it, while Rush regularly had primetime
ratings but with few exceptions was assigned 2:00 AM time slots. Look
at the news and commentary. Gore's defeat speach was coveret, Baby
Doc's victory speach wasn't.  Every conservative in government is
attacked relentlessly while Liberal officials are ignored through
every kind of scandal. How many times (how many have even heard of it)
was the check kiting or postage scams mentioned?  Clinton banks every
babe in town and gets a free ride. Even the stained dress only gets
the media interested in attacking Linda Tripp.  Yet Newt is hung out
to dry for his sleeze. Dan Quayle makes a joke about speaking Latin in
Latin America and gets painted as an idiot while Gore can't recognize
busts of the founding fathers, makes up wild stories about visiting
places he didn't and inventing the internet and the press accepts it.
Hillary makes a more lucritive book deal than Newt ever did and the
press ignores it. Gore trades nuclear secrets for donations of
millions from munks, makes secret deals with the Russians (in clear
violation of the law) and the press still rants about Iran Contra of
16 years ago. Barney Frank's boyfriend runs a homo prostitution ring
out of his office and the press is too busy ridiculing Reagan's
Altzheimers to bother discussing it. Recuctions in rate of growth of
government programs are still referred to as "cuts" and the media goes
along with the scam.  The phrase "paying for tax cuts" is used by every
station as if the tax money belongs to, was earned by, and it
rightfully the property of government!

Introduction -

What is TracFone? TracFone is a wireless phone company in partnership with 
Telefonica de Mexico based out of Orlando Florida which offers 'Nation-wide
Pre-paid service' (a partnership with Verizon Wireless) which bills your analog
phone on a "pay as you go" basis, letting you control your own costs as you 
need them. With TracFone there are no credit checks, no contracts, no age 
limits, and no costly cellular phone bills.

What makes TracFone such a unique pre-paid wireless company is that on the
phones' themselves is a time-counter that keeps track of the minutes you
use, by sending a real-time roaming update to the closest b-side wireless
carrier and then eventually to Verizon wireless who perform the necessary
updates.

For example; if you are roaming on TracFone while in Edmonton Alberta
Canada, your ESN/NAM header information will be sent to Telus Mobility's
Home Location Register (HLR) system which recognizes the account,
processes it, and from there it immediately diverts it to Verizon.

-

TracFone Trap -

TracFone Incorporated currently offers two analog Nokia model phones
to its customers: the Nokia 252, and the Nokia 918. Both models
are sleek and fully loaded with features that make using these
products enjoyable. 


-NAM PROGRAMMING-

Unfortunately, TracFone has really limited its customers freedom
by putting a limit on what other numbers - but specifically what other
carriers can be programmed into the phones NAM memory bank by locking
the first A-side SID.

The truth is customers do not have the ability to program other numbers
into the phone AT ALL, meaning you're stuck having only one account on
one phone; that being the TracFone account on the TracFone phone!

The NAM memory bank looks something like this:

(1st) phone # - 666-313-3370
(1st) SID - 0 (A-side)

(2nd) phone # - [blank]
(2nd) SID - 1 (B-side)

On the attempt to program the second memory bank you'll get the following:

"Location NAM error"

Lets say you successfully hacked the NAM programming menu code for the phone...
couldn't be too tough if you consider all the available web-sites and mailing-
lists on the Internet that focus on just that...

ie. (list) gsm_underground@yahoogroups.com
    (site) http://www.hackcanada.com/ice3/cellular/index.html
    (site) http://www.nettwerked.net/TFA/cell.html

Now to take advantage of the hack you would be required to have firstly broken
the NAM programming menu code, followed by entering in the exact same account
information (phone # and SID) that appears in the first memory bank into the
second memory bank. By roaming on the B-side you are likely to get lots of 
extra time even AFTER the TracFone's unit-counter time runs out because it 
can take from several days to a few weeks for the header info (ESN/MIN/NAM)
to be sent from say Telus or Rogers/AT&T to Verizon and then finally to 
TracFone's HLR provisioning system for "current account updates".

After this time, the TracFone's unit-counter will realize the customers 
account is out of air-time and will finally boot them off the network 
until the phone is re-filled.


		What else sucks about TracFone?


- There is no way to buy phone units online with a credit card;
  only through an authorized retailers.

- Finding authorized retailers in Canada is one thing, but finding a
  retailer at all that will accept Canadian dollars and Canadian
  addresses is another thing.

- The web-forms on tracfone.com do not accept Canadian addresses
  (ie. 12274-123st Edmonton Alberta Canada, T5X-2R9)

- If you wanted to change your account information, you would be required
  to mail your Nokia analog to TracFone (you pay the shipping fees) to be
  reset... for a fee of $75.00/USD. Call 509-710-4619 for more information.

- TracFone will not let you receive calls when on roaming due to the
  carrier and number assignment. The message the person who's calling
  your roaming TracFone will hear is Verizon's "unable to reach subscriber"
  message - this was verified by calling a roaming TracFone from a Telus
  landline.

-

Technical Notes -

(note: The Nokia 252 is virtually the same as the Nokia 918 in respects
       to programming, so don't fret my pets.)

Technical specifications on the Nokia 918 model phones offered by
TracFone Incorporated can be read at this site:

TracFone complaints: 

The following are a few examples of horror stories that current and former
TracFone customers have written about over the last four months:

(taken from http://www.bitchaboutit.com/ReadPages/telephone_complaints.htm)


   Date: 04 Jan 2001
    
   Tracfone, the biggest joke I have ever heard of! I have been trying
   for four unsuccessful weeks to contact them to activate this phone
   that they screwed up. After being disconnected over 100 times I got
   mad enough to just let it alone. They told me the hold time was 94
   minutes! I work customer service too and that is unacceptable! This
   company is going to get a piece of my mind if I ever get a person on
   the phone. They sure do have excuses though! Heard em all so far!
    - Christina Hull, MD

  
   Date: 04 Jan 2001
  
   I purchased a Tracfone on December 12th, for my boyfriend for his
   birthday. I had it "activated" on December 21st. After 3 days the
   phone still did not work, so I called back. After 5 or 6 calls and 2
   hours on hold, I reached a "technician" who "reprogrammed" the phone.
   He then performed a "test call" and the phone didn't work. So he asked
   me a couple of questions and I am mid-sentence and next thing I know I
   am back at square one, waiting on hold again for "an estimated wait
   time of 45 minutes." 3 days later I waited another 45 minutes, this
   time late at night, and reached someone who again "reprogrammed" the
   phone and assured me that whomever I spoke with previously did not
   program it right. It has now been a week since that call and still the
   phone does not work. I've been trying to call for about 4 days now,
   and you can't even wait on hold anymore, they tell you to wait 60
   minutes and call back. Please do not purchase this phone, it is a real
   hassle. There are many other pre-paid cellulars out there - buy one
   from a company with a local office where you can go and get decent
   service. I will be returning my Tracfone this weekend - thank God I
   saved the receipt.
    - Jodi Rapes, MI

   Date: 02 Jan 2001

   Tracfone has the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my
   life. I will take every chance to steer possible customers away from
   buying into this piece of doodoo service. If you call the 1-800 # then
   you better bring the book War and Peace while you wait for service.
   You will make it cover to cover and then some.
    - Mark Vatcher, NH


   Date: 26 Dec 2000

   I bought a tracfone (prepaid cellular service) from Wal mart after I
   had visited Tracfone's web site. On the site They say: Instant
   activation or in 24 hours in some areas.
   It is now 4 days and in a few hours 5 days after over 100 phone call
   attempts, busy signals, excuses etc. claiming the christmas rush, then
   blaming southwest bell and one excuse after another  
   my #$%$*&@#% phone is still not activated!!! I see you have another
   complaint on this site for TracFone. Their # is 800-867-7183

TrapFone Dot Com -

                          'TRAPFONE'

Still undergoing major construction, TRAPFONE is a site for the wireless phreak
to spread knowledge about the technical infrastructure of TRACFONE's analog
cross-country cellular network, but mainly as a place for irate (former)
customers to rant about why they think the service TRACFONE offers just plain
sucks.

-

Conclusion -

 There you have it folks; TRACFONE Wireless Incorporated is a trap 
 sucking unsuspecting customers into its us-only plan through carefully
 crafted advertising / hardware programming techniques, and have THE worst
 pre-paid cellular customer service in the world.
 
 I advise that you let all your friends and family know about this deceitful
 company so they won't be lured into the tracfone trap either. Too many
 people have been hurt already by this company... it's time we all take a
 stand and run these guys out of business once and for all.

Furtive Looks
by pinguino [pinguino@inker.com]

I feel people walking behind me
Empty footsteps passing pause to stare
Pinned against a graf-laced wall
Reaching deep into velvet darkness
There's no room for hiding
There's no chance for escape
The streetlights seem to mock me
A doorway appears one second late

 `- <| The Telus 4O3-31O-5555 Divertor Exploit |> -`


notes: this article has been written to point out
       a small yet potentially hazardous vulnerability
       within the 'Band 1 INWATS' regional (403)-310-5555
       Telus customer care system in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.


docs:


 For the last couple of months I've of received several (approximately 20)
 annoying repeat calls from the Telus customer care line; (403)-310-5555,
 from slack-jawed marketing bastards who want me to sign up for their
 rip-off long-distance plans. Normally my reaction to such calls is always
 to pick up the receiver and slam it down as fast as I can in a hopeful
 attempt that they'll take a hint that I don't want their long-distance
 shit service (T-MAX calling cards all the way, bay-be!). 

 However today I felt a little bit of love in my heart for the capitalist
 pigs (or maybe it was the vodka doin' the thinkin'?), so I decided to
 actually pick up the phone and wait for a chipper Telus employee to
 coheres me into becoming a LD subscriber. To my surprise I wasn't greeted
 with a voice, but instead a total of 30 seconds of silence. 

 "What the hell is going on?" I thought to myself. Immediately after, a
 sweet enchanting female voice said aloud: "Hello, Telus communications?
 Hello, anybody there?" "Hi, you just called me from 310-5555, are you
 going to drown me out with your marketing crap or what?" I asked her.

 "Oh no! You must be another customer who got routed to our main office.
 See what Telus has done for all of Alberta is about a couple of months
 ago we upgraded our router software and since then around 50-75% of the
 calls me make out to customers gets automatically re-routed back to us."
 she responded.

 I then proceeded to ask "I see, well I have a question for you. I hope
 you don't mind answer it." 

 "sure... annyyything" she responded with such young cheerfulness it struck
 a thousand evil sexual ideas in me all involving whips, chains and butt
 plugs. 

 "Well, when my call got routed back to you what was displayed on your
  screens for ANI information?" I asked.

 "Excuse me, ANI?" she said with confusion.

 "Caller ID..." I responded.

 "Ohh... it says, hrm... 403-310-5555" she said again with confusion. 
 (musta been a blonde)

 "all right. That's all I wanted to know. Thanks a lot." I concluded.

 "No problem. Thanks for calling Telus Communications, have a WONDERFUL day!"
 she ended with more cheerful glee. Fuckin' bitch musta taken too much
 Prozac before her shift. Figures.

 -

 Wowwy, she didn't even see me as being in the same area code!

Now, what do you think one has the ability to do when they get re-routed
to the main line at Telus Communications with their ANI information displaying
"Telus Communications, 310-5555"? Social engineering of course! :)

http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=Social%20Engineering

Having such an obvious divertor is wonderful when social engineering a
Telus employee out of their bounties and bounties of useful information.

Imagine for a second that you have just found a map to the hidden cave
of fortune, but when you got there you were confronted by a big scary
ogre who wanted you to prove you were the true prince of riches that
he's been waiting for for 15 years. You've gotta use wit, charm and charisma
to get into that cave or else he's going to crush you like a little bug
and eat your dead carcass. The same goes for social engineering Telus employees.

So if sometime in the future you *DO* get that phone call from 403-310-5555
and just happen to get re-routed to a ditsy operator broad, you'll know
how to get whatever information you want (ie. DATUs, routing codes, test #s,
an outdial, etc) because *YOU* went to the url explaining social engineering
and *YOU* read my horrible analogy!

Now go get 'em my telco tigers!

			'Heterosexuals'


Sun, March 04, 2001

ecol@nature.com 

Heterosexuals are like viruses which multiply and destroy other resources.
Viruses must be controlled, so heterosexuals must be controlled also. In
october 1999, the world population has reached 6 billions. Mankind is
exploiting, depleting and destroying the resources of nature. Mankind is
also living at the expense of other species. For example, chickens are being
produced, killed and consumed on an industrial scale. Chickens are deprived
of their natural lives in nature.

To remedy the situation people must reproduce less and consume less. The
population number must be allowed to fall. The means employed must be good,
honest and ethical. Those who do not have children are rendering a great
service to humanity, to nature and to the planet. Those who do not have
children must be rewarded. People must be encouraged to have less children.

Let the population number fall. When it reaches about 3 billions mankind can
start to replenish the earth. Note that abortion is not being justified or
encouraged. Men and women must practise abstinence.

Now those who do not reproduce must be rewarded because they are rendering a
great service to humanity and nature.

Note that it is heterosexuals who are a majority, who are exploiting,
depleting and destroying the resources of nature more.Some examples are: The
destruction of trees and forests, the excessive and uncontrollable
consumption of animals, the pollution of the atmosphere by fumes coming from
vehicles and factories, the pollution of nature, seas and rivers by
chemicals and oil, etc. Heterosexual people live more at the expense of
other species. Heterosexual people are much more responsible of this
ecological disaster. They are more responsible of the greenhouse effect
which will cause the temperature of the world to rise, causing the ice of

the north and south poles to melt. This melting of the ice will cause the
oceans to rise and submerge the coasts of almost all countries and thus
killing millions of people  and destroying natural lives. You see
heterosexuals proliferate like harmful and deadly viruses.

Okay peepz.  I finally worked up the nerve and cash to go out and pick up 
a Palm Vx, and I wanted to plunge into developing appz for it in C/C++ 
under *NIX.  I ran into a few complications with this plan.  First off all 
of the sample programs wouldn't compile properly with the sdk from 
http://www.palm.com.  After pissing around with the sdk, I finally got a 
simple app working.  It was way too much fucking work!  Some gawd damn rsc 
file, app, and Makefile.  damn!  There has got to be an easier way..  
finally after pissing around with my new palm for almost two days I found 
a really good compiler that runs on the Palm itself!!  wow.  So now I can 
write code on the road, compile and link all of the shit completely on the 
Palm computing platform!  Nifty.  I will now share with you the secrets of 
building apps with the tools I will provide to you a bit later on in this 
txt.

Simply download the following files and install them onto your Plam III/V:

http://www.h410G3n.com/releases/files/palm/OnBoard.zip
http://www.h410G3n.com/releases/files/palm/RsrcEdit.zip
http://www.h410G3n.com/releases/files/palm/pedit32.zip
http://www.h410G3n.com/releases/files/palm/qed.zip

(aka OnBoardC... http://www.individeo.net/OnBoardC.html)

Notes on the compiler:

- It will compile C/C++ and it has a separate assembler/dissembler (damn 
   handy tool for all that shitty crippleware out there)
- It can make "Hackmaster Extensions"
- It has a full Rsrc editor that can edit every bitmap+piece of asm on the 
   unit (careful, don't corrupt your palm with it)
- All of the above files *must* be in the same "category" or you will 
   crash your Palm.  I learned this real fast. :D
- The pedit is by far the best text editor for PalmOS, and the reg screen 
   is busted??  just enter in any old code and it will register in a snap 
   for you. (Or don't if you like the nag screen).


Okay, don't get too crazy at first.  Some of the components are really 
touchy, and if you do something you are not supposed to, you *will* crash  
the unit.  (Hope I didn't scare you) :)

Simply run the OnboardC program, select "New project" from the pulldown 
menu.  Check the "generate skeleton" and make a name for your app (no 
spaces) and select "memo" as your source editor. (DO NOT SELECT pedit32 or 
it will CRASH the unit).

Now you should see your new project.  Click the "Build Button" and watch 
it compile a binary.  Neat-o!  Exit the program, and run your new app.  
Nice!  It executes.  Go back into OnboardC, and select the Rsrc file and 
click RsrcEdit.  This is the GUI editor.  You can now customize all 
the buttons in your program, add pulldown menus, draw in bitmaps -- the 
works!  When you have a nice GUI, simply save it, exit OnboardC and 
load pedit  (If you do not get a list of memos, click the OK button near 
the bottom), and open your C++ code.  Simply edit it, save, and compile a 
finished app.


Have fun!

dead of night. the world sleeps. all is at rest. here i sit. in my room. 
utter darkness save the light emnating from my 17inch monitor. 
the world falling apart. piece by pice. slowly a new world emerges.
what will the future bring? change. if only i could take this time, save 
it forever. maybe to be taken out years in the future. one last beacon of 
hope. of what life used to be. my generation will die off. all around me, 
my time is death. yet i wont be relieved. i will long for it.
my time is gone. everything to me. nothing to others. 
whoever said change is good. still hasnt grown up...


mgkvj_pqycm if your wondering what this is. its nothing...


shadow of guilt... 
well of doubt...
which is which?...
theres nothing save, about...
broken and sore...

it seemed so divine...
on a steady incline...
quickly shot down...
occult... malign...
a beautiful thing... 

the nights flowing gown...
which way to go...
no coice... they go down...
what once would distress...
passes without fuss...

they tag and colar...
we accept it all...
confine us to pens...
often labeled "mall"...

catatonic now...
at least in their eyes...
which is all that matters...
mine are crusted and blind...

Why not get drunk?...
forget all this pain...
heh, i now realize... 
thats an action in vain...

what the fuck has happened...
i think in disdain...


We hate ravers.  They are the scum of the earth.  They are robots, fashion
victims with bad clothes, bad haircuts and seriously substandard drugs.  We
hate skaters.  Get a job, quit clogging the streets.  We hate Goths.  Goth is
dead.  They can't dance because they are too worried about breaking into a
sweat and having their make-up run.  We hate punks, punk is also dead.  The
symbols are meaningless in the 90's.  We hate indie kids: face it, m(orr)isery
is a sad bastard, Robot Smith is a prick and flares really did go out in the
70's.  That also goes for shoegazers because they are "sensitive" pseudo 
intellectual gits who can't dance either.  We hate industrial kids and cyber
punks.  Putting NIN on the back of your jacket does not make you cool.  We
hate Metallers, especially fluffy metallers:  perms are for poodles, open 
shirts are for Burt Reynolds and head banging/air guitar gits who can't play.
We hate crusties:  the new age will not be hastened by wandering the streets
with backpacks, dogs on string, dreads and sitting on your arse listening to
the Levellers or NMA smoking far too much dope.  We hate rap kids: "Yo Homey"
means something in South Central, it means fuck all here.  Most of all we 
hate collective identity:  every day of your pathetic life you are being put 
in a little box by society by the way you look or the bands you listen to.
Collective identity sucks.  Be an individual, don't make it easy to be 
dismissed in a sentence.
