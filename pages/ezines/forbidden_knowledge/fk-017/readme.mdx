phyleshare!get, by wzd
----------------------

My first idea was to write a transparent ftp-like client for phyleshare!, also
using Outlook, but it sounded like too much work for such a crap thing, & I am
lazy, sew I wrote psget.pl instead, which allows you to automagically process
your directory listing & file request replies into a directory on your
harddrive specified by you and out of your mailbox so that all your kool
friendz at work don't see how much w4r3z you've been downloading.

Just run psget.pl [keyword1,keyword2,..] with keyw0rdz for all the k-r4d
phyleshare! w4r3z ark1v3z you are now frequenting every morning before you
start Outlook.. ;p

psget.pl has support for multiple attachments - however, the server I wrote
doesn't, but when/if it does, this will be ready (& also good for anyone
else's implementation of this which happens to allow for multiple file
requests in a single e-mail).. [As far as I know, as of yet, no1 else has
written anything to do this stupid crap, but I think the idea is a bit
appealing perhaps.. ;p]
