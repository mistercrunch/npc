Readme for spe2.dpr - Extract share passwords from registry
Sigma &lt;sigma@mdma.za.net>
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, so as you might know, M$ uses a XOR cypher to encrypt the share passwords
that Windoze stores in its registry. I was looking around insecure.org when
I came accross it in the exploits section, and so I decided to code this proggy.
It compiles as a 32bit console app under Delphi 3.

New in version 2.0 (28/04/2000)

- Wyzewun bitched that I should comment my code, so I made an attempt this time.
- HUGE code cleanup, version 1.0 was about 400 lines long, due to my stupidity,
  now its under 150 lines.
- Now you can sort of see whats going on here.
- Gives the path of the share.
