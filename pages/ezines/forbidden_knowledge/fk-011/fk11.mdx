Short Story of the Month: "The Doom that came to Sarnath" by HP Lovecraft

Fun: Walking out the plane in Zimbabwe's airport wearing a T-Shirt that says
     "Whites rule. The Zimbabwean government is hiding the aliens from us.
     Gay Rights now."

Scary: Seeing an automatically flushing urinal for the first time ever just
       after eating Psilocybe Mushrooms

Oh: If you have copies of Forbidden Knowledge printed out and lying in your
    office's waiting room like we have heard several people have - PLEASE
    PLEASE PLEASE take a photo of them and your waiting room, scan them in,
    and e-mail them to wizdumb@leet.org ;-) Don't have a scanner? E-mail us
    for a snail mail addy, but just GET US THOSE PICTURES. =)

Amusing: Thabo Mbeki's public statement (and letter to Bill Clinton) saying
         that it can't be proved that HIV leads to AIDS - especially
         considering how much goddamn medical experience he has. And lets not
         even *begin* to consider the amount of damage a statement like that
         can cause when almost a *third* of the world is HIV positive. Thabo
         Mbeki, I sincerely hope that you get AIDS and die. I am actually
         *ashamed* to have such a fucking idiot as a president.

think i know him, just not sure.

	I'm glad you wrote me, I tried to contact you like two months ago,
but those addresses bounced back.  I added you folks to the site... feel
free to shoot me an email whenever you guys release, and I'll announce it
on my site.  You might consider making a mailing list to announce
whenever there's a release to readers, or something.  Keep in touch.

Okay, so my ascii art sucks (I guess I shoulda gotten Cyberphreak to draw
this) but what the fuck. Regardless, they're tall and thin, and are opened at
the top using the little hole which I pathetically tried to depict. ;-P It
appears that these boxes are Telkom's new preffered system, and they are worth
finding ways to break into (That prefferably don't involve kicking the whole
thing to pieces) - and if you succeed in breaking into one - write us an
article on it!@#$% :-)

Here's an *EXTREMELY* simple little patch for tcp_seq.h I wrote for
FreeBSD (tested on 3.4-RELEASE, but should work on 2.2 - 4.0) to increase
security and to stop nmap from recognizing the OS (which is the real
reason I wrote it, the extra security offered is not really necessary :P).
This just shows you how simply a TCP/IP fingerprint can be spoofed...

Once extracted just run patch tcp_seq.h diff.file in /sys/netinet

Looking through the logs on Pneuma's box I found this...

&lt;snip>
&lt;Gentoo> Well, the buffer overflow examples are a little lame ... but, it
actually seems okay at second glance.
&lt;Pneuma> hehhehehehe, it usually is, it grows on you
&lt;Gentoo> THough, I could see why you might have to try so hard -- it's on
Windoze ......
&lt;Pneuma> whats on windows?
&lt;Gentoo> The buffer overflow program example.
&lt;Pneuma> heh, its aimed at newbies and compiles under *nix neway :P
&lt;Gentoo> Well, it's also C++ ... cin >> of course checks for buffer overflows.
&lt;/snip>

*Sigh* I hate it when idiots try and make it look like *I'm* wrong...

Gosh, EIP and EBP look a bit weird. *Sigh* Just because texts up to now have
not mentioned buffer overflow related problems with cin and ifstream doesn't
mean they don't exist.

In fact, I am willing to *bet* that the buffer overflows in WinAMP's reading
of playlists and Netscape Navigator's reading of prefs.js were both caused by
improper use of an ifstream. This is also a huge problem because this is how
*every* C++ course/tutorial tells programmers to use their ifstreams like
that. Anyway, the real moral of the story - Fuck off and check your facts
before you whine. ;-P

interest to some hoez...

Indeed we are still putting out the ezine. Sorry, but we've been off for
awhile, mainly due to real life problems in everyones schedule. Real life
comes before internet. Anyhow, we're back in business, and we're stronger than
ever.
&lt;/snip>

&lt;snip>
(ps. if you have anybody else you know that would be interested in submitting
anything to the ezine please let them know that we'll look at anything
especially if it has something about social antics or programming in it.
thnx.)

Pneuma and I have decided to chose some completely arbitary race to hate with
a passion. We looked in an Atlas and found Andorra, a tiny little country
between France and Spain with a population of about 2000, and decided that it
would do well. Before we were completely unaware of the great threat of this
nation, and now we have made the shocking discovery that They're everywhere!
They're taking all our jobs! They're corrupting our way of life!

First of all - you must know how to identify Andoranns so as to be able to
persecute them at every possible moment. We have decided that they all,
without doubt, have hair growing out their ears. You can also always tell an
Andorran by their nose. We don't know exactly what *about* it, but we are sure
this identification technique is also completely infallable.

And boy oh boy, when an Andorran moves into your neighbourhood - you'll know
about it! Your children will worship Satan, take drugs, and eat... starchy
stuff! Things will go missing everywhere (The Andorrans are *born* thieves,
they even steal their currency from France and Spain!) And we're not even
going to *begin* talking about their SMELL!

So - join the fight against Andorra before it's too late! Besides - it's fun
saying "Oh yeah, well at least (X Racial Group) aren't as bad as the fucking
ANDORRANS!" and everyone always assumes that comments about Andorrans relate
to *their* racial group - whatever that may be.

Oh, and if you live in Andorra, please, please, e-mail us. ;-P

Real-life quote of the month...

&lt;Pneumas_Mom> Marcel, it says in this magazine that men like being anally

Don't want your Java to run on Microsoft VM's? Then instead of using this...

  public static void main(String[] args) {

Use THIS...

  static void main(String[] args) {

And it will work in anything except M$-made stuff. ;-)

Byteware from Jus...

How to impress your lame linux buddies? If you haven't figured this one out
yet, congratulations - I'm speechless. 'nix uses a file called /etc/hosts to
identify known hosts for domain resolution, to prevent a full DNS lookup
everytime that host or IP is used, or if a DNS lookup isn't suitable for that
IP. Usually this will contain something like localhost resolving to 127.0.0.1
and your machines (static) IP and its hostname (obviously only if the machine
has one) /etc/hosts ovverrides DNS lookups, so you can play cute games with it
on your machine. For example, change 127.0.0.1's resolution from "localhost"
to "whitehouse.gov". Telnet 127.0.0.1, login and voila - do a "who" and see
yourself logged in from the whitehouse :P

This can actually be very useful to hide your connections as many people will
take what a "who" says at face value and not look any further into it - root a
box, change your current IP's resolution in that machines /etc/hosts to your
enemy next door, and telnet in and you appear to be connected from
idiot.hostname.com's machine... now there's a thought... Obviously you can't
use this very seriously - if you're smart enough to get that far you will
realise that a netstat -na will show otherwise :P

Got any annoying network firewall you wanna sneak around? Well, if you aren't
a prize circus clown then you may have already discovered the beauty of some
simple code known as datapipe (src on www.security.za.net). Your usual network
firewall will have basic things open like http (80) and ftp (21) allowed out,
but not your favorite's like telnet (23), ssh (22) or irc (6667) - tsk, shame.
Datapipe lets you setup a pipe for data coming in on one port to another port
on another host - sounds interesting. You could run datapipe on a machine
outside of your network to listen on port 80 or 21, and then pipe the
connection to your irc server on port 6667, or even to the local machine's
telnet or ssh port... gee, that was tough. You could then /server
externalmachine.com 21 or telnet externalmachine.com 80, and the network
firewall will allow the outgoing data stream, but the external datapipe will
change the flow of data to where you really want it to go -
deranged.blabber.net (6667) for example :) [Wyzewun: Yeh, BlabberNet is neat,
pity about the gay IRCOps there though (Jus, Vortexia, TimeWiz) :P] You will
get datapipe, use it and like it. Duh.

_.    Hacking Reality: An Introduction to Khaos Magick by Wyzewun ._ ,;:;,, _.

As a practicing Chaote, I was very interested to have recently seen two
articles regarding occult issues in what would strictly be called H/P e-zines.
The two e-zines I am reffering to are b4b0 issue 9 and b0g issue 2, and the
two schools covered being Khaos Magick and Satanism respectively. Both zines
are available @ PSS should you be interested in checking them out some time.
(http://packetstorm.securify.com/mag)

So why did I see a need for another article on the subject? Well, Synner's
article in b4b0, despite being quite good, left out a few very important
points as to what Khaos Magick is all about. I will also try and throw as many
of my personal opinions about Khaos Magick into this as possible, to make it
interesting to people already familiar with the system. And ultimately, it's
hard to summarize such a complex system in a single article - so read both
anyway. ;-)

As for reading the article in b0g on Satanism... well... I have to be honest -
I found the entire original content insipid and stupid but the passages quoted
directly out of Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible make it worth reading anyway,
despite the typos. Especially considering that LaVey was influenced by
Aleister Crowley and HP Lovecraft as were many of the early Khaos Magicians
like Austin Osman Spare. And more importantly, regardless of that article,
b0g has to be one of the funniest zines the H/P community have produced ever.

Right. Now Let's get started... The alt.magick.chaos FAQ contains a menagerie
of definitions of Khaos Magick, and I suggest you read them all should you
be interested. But the one I am going to give you in this article comes from
Joseph Max.555, who I think defines it quite well...

   Chaos Magick is currently the cutting edge of modern Ceremonial
   Magick. It largely grew out of the work of Austin Osman Spare, though
   it has been fractalized into many forms over the last 10 or so years.
   
   Chaos Magick emphasizes a personal, experimental approach to magickal
   practice, de-emphasizes "traditional" approaches (ie. GD, OTO, et al)
   especially as regards "secret knowledge", male/female dichotomies and
   order hierarchy; what can be learned from Masters or Gurus is far less
   important or effective than what a dedicated researcher can discover
   for hirself. As such, shamanism is incorporated more directly than
   such historical approaches as Kaballa, though most Chaotes are quite
   adept at examining traditional systems, incorporating what works and
   discarding that which holds no personal appeal.
   
   Chaos Magicians look at Magick as being a _living_ art rather than an
   _antique_ one. They regard the various belief structures of magick as
   being the _means_ rather than the _end_, and the most adept can alter
   their belief-state as easily as they change clothes. Chaos Magick
   recognizes no particular system of theology as having any more
   "reality" than any other, and most Chaotes (like Jung) approach
   dieties as being no more than archtypical constructs of the
   subconscious mind. Therefore they are far less concerned with having
   any (in their eyes) arbitrary moral system pounded into their skulls
   before getting to actually put magickal techniques into practical use
   than "Old Aeon" systems like the GD's or Abra-Melin.
   
   Chaos Magick propounds no particular dogma or moral system, beyond
   it's most common identifier: "Nothing is True, and Everything is
   Permitted."
   
   I have yet to meet, however, any adept Chaos Magician who doesn't have
   a strong sense of personal ethics and subscribe to it feverently.

And in this one see's many of the points which Synner neglected to mention.
But before even beginning to touch on those, I'm going to hop way back and
give my personal definition of Magick in general for the benefit of those
unfamiliar with such a concept beyond fairy-tale literature...
                                  
Magick is the art of bending reality to one's will for whatever reason be it
personal or so-called "god sent". Magick *has* to exist simply because so many
people in so many different places practice it. And even should Magick *not*
exist, *because* so many people practice it, it *does*. Why? Because Magick
exists. Confused? Good. I have succeeded in wasting your time. Now let's move
on... ;-)

Now let's begin to look at approaches to Magick. Up to the point where Khaos
Magick stepped into the world, Magick was approached largely from a
traditional viewpoint. This means that Magick has been performed in manners
passed down over generations, the original method of which was probably
obtained from some-one who had ingested something hallucinogenic, was mildly
insane, or perhaps actually had a very strong affinity with the supernatural.
Of course, to a Chaos Magician (reffered to from here on as Chaotes), which
one of these it was doesn't really matter in terms of effectivity. :)

You see, most chaotes adopt Jung's concept of gods as archetypes of the
subconscious mind. Thus the emphasis is not placed on *HOW* Magick should be
performed, but on actually *MAKING* it happen. The Chaote acknowledges that
an invocation to Homer Simpson can be just as effective and in some cases
perhaps even more effective than one to a traditional deity. Also, which
represents drunkeness better to you - Dionysus (ancient greek god of wine) or
Barney from the Simpsons? I thought so. Now maybe you're whining that Barney
isn't a "god", but to some extent, he IS, in that by you *thinking* of him as
a god, he becomes so. Nothing needs to "exist" - it works anyway - which is
why Chaos Magick is the only school to have Athiest magicians. :)

In Conclusion, I would like to recommend that anyone interested in learning
more about Magick and particularly Khaos Magick, should read the work of
the following people who have written stuff in these fields...

Psychology: Jung, Freud, Nietschze

Occult: Peter Carrol, Austin Osman Spare, Anton LaVey, Aleister Crowley,
        Tzimon Yliaster, Phil Hine

Fiction: Isaac Asimov (Esp. "The Last Question"), HP Lovecraft, JRR Tolkein

Art and Theatre Movements: Surrealism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Absurdism,
                           Existentialism, Expressionism

_.                Cisco PIX Denial of Service by Vortexia         ._ ,;:;,, _.

Hi All, just a bit of a security notification.

Cisco has been informed of this problem and Im waiting for a fix for the
problem, Ive also noted that various other firewalls are effected by this
code, though if you wanna know if whatever you are running is effected,
you will have to test it.

A brief rundown of the problem.

If you run routable ips on your internal interface on your pix, and
routeable ips on your external interface, so the pix is not running nat,
the pix keeps a state table of everything going on.  Anything that is not
in your state table that attempts to come in from the outside is denied,
even if there is a conduit in place to permit anything.  Which means that
you have to establish a connection from your internal network to your
external network before anything external can send data back.  This is a
really nice feature, unfortunatly there is a big of a bug that I found in
this.  While testing on in house equipment for possible flaws, as we
continually test various products, I found the following.

On recieving a RST packet (TCP Reset) from a given host with the correct
source and destination port, the PIX will drop the state entry for that
particular connection, which means the tcp connection dies due to the fact
that no state entry the external box can no longer talk to the internal
box.

So, if we take a standard raw ip packet, give it a tcp header, and set the
source ip as a machine that your internal box is connected to, and the
destination ip as your internal machine, set the source port on the
spoofed ip as the port the person is connected to, set your destination
port on your destination ip cyclically to possible source ports on his
side, and send resets, it will drop the persons state table entry, cutting
him off from the box he is connected to.

Now, the one question I asked when I wrote this, is why does this work,
why is there no seq/ack checking on RST packets, this was answered in the
TCP RFC, saying that seq/ack numbers are not checked on RST packets,
however they are checked on FIN packets, hence using FIN packets for this
test is futile without sequence prediction code.

There is a simple work around for this problem however, and anyone wishing
to know the details of that is free to email me at andrew@cnsec.co.za for
details.

Below I have posted example code to show the exploit and how it works, and
hopefully this will be useful to someone on this list and help fix a
fairly nasty denial of service problem.

Many Thanks

_.              An Introduction to Java Servlets by Wyzewun       ._ ,;:;,, _.

Java Servlets are an extremely powerful server side CGI-replacement supported
by most major web-servers, and used by very few admins - most notably because
they either don't know they exist or don't have the skill needed to write
them. Java Servlets have several advantages over Perl and other traditional
CGI languages in they are faster to write and to run, infinitely more secure,
and have all the advantages of the extremely well furnished Java Servlet API.

In this tutorial I will teach you how to write simple Java servlets. Although
a knowledge of the Java language is not *completely* necessary to understand
this, it will certainly help. What you *will* need is a basic knowledge of the
HTTP protocol, of HTML, and of any object-orientated programming language.
With that said - let's get going...

Servlets are written as if normal programs except they extend the Superclass
HttpServlet. We just override the functions doGet(), doPut(), doTrace(),
doPost() and doDelete() -  the HTTP request each one handles is kinda obvious.
=) Right, let's code a simple servlet quick...

import javax.servlet.*;       // Import the libraries we need to make HTTP
import javax.servlet.http.*;  // servlets and throw the right exceptions

// Here we declare the class and make it extend the HttpServlet Superclass
class SimpleExample extends HttpServlet {

/* This over-rides doGet() and passes it the user's request (called "req" in
   this example) and the Servlet's response (called "res" here). Both
   exceptions thrown are required by the HttpServlet superclass */
 void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res)
   throws ServletException, IOException {

   // Set HTTP Content Type
   response.setContentType("text/html");
   // Get communicating with the luser
   PrintWriter out = res.getWriter();
   // Send HTML
   out.println("&lt;html>&lt;head>&lt;title>Servlet Output&lt;/title>&lt;/head>&lt;body>"
   + "&lt;h1>FUQ J0O!@#$&lt;/h1>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>");
   // Close Stream
   out.close();

} // end of doGet();
} // end of SimpleExample

OK, this issue is being released tomorrow, and a chiq friend of mine bought me
a bottle of champagne and a condom for my birthday, so I gotta be honest - I
don't have time to finish this article. :) Will make a sequel in future issues
if I think anybody cares enough. Cheers...

_.                Fixing M-Web Specific Modems by JungleG         ._ ,;:;,, _.

&lt;DISCLAIMER>
I don't know anything about what I'm about to tell you - I haven't tried it
myself.  I don't own any Mweb modems, nor do I condone doing this. If you
ever try to turn this against me, in any way, I cannot be held responsible
and you must pay me 100 million Rand.
&lt;/DISCLAIMER>

So, you're sitting there one day and this advert comes on the TV telling you
that you can buy a Mweb Net-Getter (sp?) modem for R99.  Great you think,
this is awesome, I can get myself a 56K modem for only R99, right?

Wrong.

The Mweb Net-Getter modem are Mweb specific, ie. they only work when you
dial into an Mweb POP. Until now.

Here's what you do:

1) Find yourself an EPROM writer.  Most universities and some security companies
have them too.
2) Go to your favourite electronics suplier and buy a 27c2000 EPROM Chip.
3) Find a friend / uncle / relative / boss / etc who has a Fastlink V.90
modem.
4) Open the Fastlink up. remove the EPROM and copy the EPROM from the
Fastlink onto your newly Bought 27c2000 EPROM.
5) Close the Fastlink modem up and return it.
5) Open the Mweb modem up and replace the existing EPROM with the newly
bought and programmed 27c2000 EPROM.
6) Close the Mweb modem.
7) Plug and Pray.
8) There is no 8 .. I thought 8 looked good though.

Easy as that, you now have a 56K V90 modem for R99.

Section A - What is a DNS?
--------------------------

   A DNS - Domain Name Server, is used to convert host names to IP addresses
   and IP addresses to host names.
   for example: www.infoseek.com = 204.162.96.173
&lt;/snip>

&lt;snip>
      2. What is the theory behind the exploit?
         The exploit uses a Buffed Overflow in BIND versions 8.2 - 8.2.2 to
         gain a remote root shell.
&lt;/snip>

&lt;snip>
      6. How do I compile the exploit?
         As always:
         $gcc t666.c -o t666&lt;ENTER>
         $

      7. How do I run the exploit?
         $su&lt;ENTER>
         Password:&lt;password>&lt;ENTER>
         #./t666 1&lt;ENTER>
&lt;/snip>

&lt;snip>
Section D - Who should be credited for this HowTo?
--------------------------------------------------

      1. who is the person that motivated me into writing this?
         That person is no other the gov-boi, he operates the great site
         www.hack.co.za. Without him, this How-To would have never been writen!
         Thanks Gov-Boi :)
