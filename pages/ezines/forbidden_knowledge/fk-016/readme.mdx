Thanks to beserker for pointing me towards this hilarious document. :)

The erroneous datestamp at the bottom confused me, but it turned out to just
be funniness with the way MS Word displays datestamps. I noticed when I ran it
through strings...

--
Created on the
 DATE \@ "yy/MM/dd"
00/10/10
 at
 TIME \@ "hh:mm AM/PM"
03:15 PM
--

ie. It uses the datestamp of the file itself (which would be when I downloaded
it), but the real datestamp is 03:15 PM 00/10/10.

Enjoy!
