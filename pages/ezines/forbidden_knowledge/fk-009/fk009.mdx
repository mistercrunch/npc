Yes: I finally gave in. Pneuma made me watch 'Hackers' - the movie. I have

Thought: The new Quake 3 engine is open-source and multiplatform... So when
         the fuck are the VRML Consortium going to realise they don't have
         any choice but to adopt it? ;)

Another thought: If your mommy buys you a domain, you still aren't elite.

Supplies Low. Starving to Death. Send Help immediately.

Yeh, I'm in boarding school - Can you handle it? ;) Heh, actually I just
really needed to get away from my fantastically pathetic and completely
emotionally inept parents and boarding school was the quickest escape route at
hand. *Sigh* It works well enough, so what the hell. And besides, living here
is dope - a ley line runs directly through the hostel. (Those of you with a
vague knowledge of the occult will know what I am talking about - the rest of
you - get a clue bizatch! :P)

At the end of this year I'll probably be sharing a place with Moe1 and/or 
Pneuma, so that should be quite cool. Once again, I don't want to have to live
with my parents for longer than a month inbetween finishing school and then -
the weekends I spend with them are bad enough. I get depressed being away from
people with talent, emotions and opinions - so shoot me. Anyway, everything is
going to take a complete turn-around next year when I begin my new life as a
suit - pHEAR! =) Mmm, I'm not sure exactly how becoming an upstanding citizen
will affect FK, but hopefully, the impact upon it will be minimal.

I just wouldn't *like* being a jargon-spewing egocentric suit with a
surgically removed personality, and although I will make a very concerned
effort to appear as mentally stable as possible to potential clients, I
don't want personal things like FK to have to change. It's my baby, and I
like it the way it is, damnit. :P

Anyway, enjoy this issue - Regardless of what the future holds for us, this
issue is still bad as ever. Good ol' reliable FK... ;D

Byteware from Wyzewun...
------------------------

Vodacom SMS billing lags significantly behind normal billing. Say no more.

Oh yeh, Sigma pointed out to me that that bug in TP7's Crt library only
affects Celeron processors. Right. Case closed. We understand the problem
fully... Errr... Two issues after the problem occured, HEH. ;-)

---

Right. Time for a gay little trick to play on Windoze 98 Users. Find an old
copy of Pacman (or anything else you want) that can't be exitted in any way
other than rebooting the whole PC. Set it up so that it so that it will
always run in MS-DOS mode. Then run it, and watch Pacman boot instead of
Windoze again and again. :)

Wyzewun's Wizdumb of the Month: Do NOT buy a bulk load of Ephedrine, test it,
and then attempt to deliver your English oral assignment.

By the way, all cellphone calls in ZA are monitored now... And I mean ALL of
them, so do not transmit sensitive info over Vodacom or MTN.

---

My Motherboard blew totally (I optimistically thought it was just my video
card, only to find myself wrong) but regardless, the next FK may take a while
longer depending on how much I'm gonna need to spend on parts to fix it. :(
This issue lay on my hard-drive untouched for a good 3 weeks before release
and I had to do the final work on this issue on my mom's windoze box. :/ HEH,
I think some hardware company should donate FK an iBook with OpenBSD, don't
you? :P

Well, not saying that I would object if some company did, it is also next to
impossible that that will happen. So, I think I'm going to be working a bit,
and buying myself an iBook or a Powerbook G4 when it comes out, and installing
OpenBSD on it. I just travel too damn much to cope with having a full size PC,
so I need to get mobile. And why a Mac? Well, although MacOS is pathetic, Mac
hardware kicks ass - so put OpenBSD on it, and you've got something that kicks
a PC's butt. :)

But the real issue here is - I don't know how regularly FK is going to be
released while I don't have a PC - my schedule is quite full, and I've got
lots of things to do with cash before I fix my box. I owe people money, My
cellphone has been stolen so I no longer have any access to any phone of any
description, and with all this mounting pressure - you gotta let me buy a beer
or summing every so often. :/

Okay. That was a fairly long rant given that this is the fuqn byteware
coloumn, but gimmee a break - I'm a poor hoe, I have *NO* equipment to play
with (I don't live with my parents), and I'm going fuqn CRAZY!@#$%^*@()*@*()

The Argosoft FTP Server &lt;www.argosoft.com> contains multiple vulnerabilities
in various FTP commands which allow execution of arbitary code and the
ability to read any file on the hard-drive.

Any command followed by 2050 characters causes the FTP Server to crash.

example:

C:\>ftp 127.0.0.1
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
220 Argosoft FTP Server, Version 1.0 (1.0.0.7)
User (127.0.0.1:(none)):AAAAAAAAAAAA...(2050 characters long)

After a while the FTP Server logs show...

(     4) 'Error: Access violation at address 00401CBB in module
'FTPSERVER.EXE'. Write of address 41414145

[Wyzewun's Babblings: Classic Buffer Overflow]

[Wyzewun's Babblings: This is a BSS Overflow (Uninitialized Heap Data). Or at
 least I think it is - some-one bitch at me if I'm wrong. Anyway, The BSS is
 executable in most OS's, for pretty much no reason at all (Like we're going
 to need to execute a whole bunch of zeros), and Windoze is no exception. In
 fact, I think the only exception is Solaris - I can't say I'm sure about that
 though. Anyway, having an executable BSS creates a pointless security threat,
 and OS developers really should stop making it as such.]

[Wyzewun's Babblings: Heap overflow. This also works even without the 'CWD' or
 whatever in front of it - the bug is in the code that recieves the command
 from the socket, not in the code that executes it. I don't know exactly how
 the author has written this program for this problem to occur, so I think
 I'll leave it at "badly". :P]

Argosoft FTP Server allows directory climbing out of homedirectory in the same
manner Wyzewun covered with E-Serv last issue. Just 'quote cwd ../' and you're
on your way. ;-)

Argosoft FTP Server keeps passwords in plain text in the users.dat file, so
get that if you want.

This has been tested under Win95, Win98 and WinNT.

Bottom line: Argosoft FTP Server offers NO security.

And now, for humours sake, the authors reaction to me showing him this...

------------------ snip snip -----------------------
Thanks for your list. It is really very handy and useful. But, you will have
to keep in mind, that what I am offering is a freeware program, and you should
not be demanding from it too much security, and handling of such a difficult
issues such large strings and so on.

[Moe1: hmm... too much security??? wtf is the bitch talkin about?? there aint
NO security in this ftp server!]

[Wyze1: Damn straight, and just coz yer program is free, doesn't mean it has
to be AWFUL. And how difficult is a 'for' loop and a routine to get a single
character? How difficult is the Delphi equivalent of a strstr()? I'm only 16,
my code *sucks*, and *I* don't find this difficult. And the thing that really
scares me here is that all this is coming from a programmer by profession.
Heeey, that's an idea! Nevermind my final year of school, I'm going to go and
work for Argosoft!!@#$% :P]

Anyway, I will keep in mind all your comments and suggestions, and definitely
will do improvements.

Happy New Year!!!

First off, let's cover phreaking the telkom tetabox fones. Note: Not the big
blues ones, those small ones you find in some places [Wyzewun: He's reffering
to Telkom's Chatterbox range. You'll recognize it coz it says "Chatterbox" on
it - imagine that :P]

This technique was picked up by me when trying to phone ppl in Johannesburg
when i was at boarding school, and lets you use telkom coin phone to phone for
free (not exactly free cause the line still gets charged just not you)...

1) You need access to the plugin point of the phone (some of the older phones
   have a point where the jack can be attached to the phone, in the newer ones
   the jack is already attached, therefore you need to find then point where
   the jack goes into the wall instead)

2) Now dial '080' and wait for the fast engaged signal [Wyzewun: Number
   unobtainable tone]

3) When you have the signal quickly take the jack out of the connection point
   and put it back in, check if the phone has dialing tone and 080 is still
   printed on the LCD screen, if there is no dialing tone you have moved the
   line in and out too fast, if the 080 is not printed on the screen you have
   moved the line too slow

4) Now the phone has 080 on the screen and then you can dial the number you
   want. Also note that if you want to dial a local number you must enter the
   area code.

Theory behind this: The phone is lead to believe that you are dialing a 080
(toll free) number.

Wondering: If you cut a fone line coming out a normal payphone and connect it
to so that you have a point where you can connect and disconnect as you
please, would this work? [Wyzewun: Yeh]

Now for How to get mastercode for unlocking cellphones...

The code is a combination of the SP code (5 digit) and phone IMEI (15 digit)
use mc1.exe and mc2.exe to get the code

To view the IMEI of the Cell, press: *#06#

Check,Activate or Remove card restrictions

    #pw+XXXXXXXXXX+1# - Provider-Lock status
    #pw+XXXXXXXXXX+2# - Network-Lock status 
    #pw+XXXXXXXXXX+3# - Provider(???)-Lock status 
    #pw+XXXXXXXXXX+4# - SimCard-Lock status 

XXXXXXXXXX (master code) is a 10 digit code, based on the IMEI number of your
phone. Press * many times for "p" and "w".

Service Provider Codes

MTN = 655 10
Vodacom = 655 01

Now let's play around a bit with Net monitor on your cellphones (works wif
Nokia 51xx and 61xx maybe 3210)

Net Monitor is an extended menu on Nokia Phone. This will be a new additional
Menu on your Nokia 5110 if you installing this option. For enabling the Net
Monitor with a FBUS cable you need the DOS software PCLocals V1.3.

The Network Monitor gives you the following information:

Carrier number
MS RX level in dBM 
Received signal quality 
MS TX power level 
C1 (path loss criterion, used for cell selection and reselection). The range
is -99 to 99
RLT (Radio Link timeout) 
Timeslot 
Indication of the transmitter status 
Information on the network parameters 
TMSI (temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) 
Cell Identification (CELL ID, number of the cell being used) 
MCC (Mobile Country Code) 
MNC (Mobile Network Code) 
LAC (location Area Code) 
Ciphering (on/off) 
Hopping (on/off) 
DTX (on/off) 
Discarding cell barred information

Here is a 10 step description for enabling the net monitor (field test
display) using PCLocals:

Make sure to start PCLocals in plain DOS

First don't connect the phone, start the program and ignore the error message.
Configure the cable type and com port (hardware com port, not the virtual com
port like for the datasuite).
Save the settings, quit the program. 
Connect the phone with the cable and start the program. 
The phone "boots" as you enter the main menu and all options become available
(all menus are white colored).
Choose menu 3 (ME Memory Functions). 
Choose menu 6 (Field Test Display Settings). 
Now you have the following options:

Enter 243 to activate the "big" net monitor (menu 01 to 89 including menus 01
to 19).
Enter 242 to activate the "small" net monitor (menu 01 to 19). 
Enter 241 to deactivate the net monitor. 
Enter 240 to reset timers (?) 
Don't forget to confirm your selection with hitting enter (you won't see any
reaction but it's necessary)

Quit the program, the phone "boots" and enjoy the net monitor 

All following actions are done with the phone.

Go to the menu net monitor and at the test prompt enter 241 to deactivate the
net monitor completely. Furtherly you can change from the big net monitor to
the small net monitor by entering 242 at the test prompt (if menu net monitor
is still available); Note: after that you can't change to the big net monitor
again!!

Note: if u cant find pclocals use net_monitor.exe, i dunno if it gets the big
or small menu

Back when I used to break into systems, I would always mail the Sys Admin of
the boxlet telling him how to fix the flaw I was exploiting, asking only a
simple "Thank You" for my services... Apparently, this was too much to ask.
More often than not, I would get no reply whatsoever, and if I did, it was
usually a "Fuck You" letter. Great. So much for ethics and helping people. I
guess the flaw will just have to stay there until some-one UN-ethical decides
to exploit it.

I have since stopped (since a while before I started FK), but I still have to
deal with the same crap attitudes, and the same people treating me the same
way for being what I am - young. My opinion is frequently dropped in favour of
complete charlatans' opinions, purely on the grounds that I am significantly
younger than them. Why? Well, I thought about it quite a bit, and could reach
only one possible conclusion...

The middle-aged IT Professional of today probably never even saw a computer
until they got to university, at which stage they studied for anything from 3
to 8 years to obtain the knowledge they have. Today, computers are
common-place, and people are teaching themselves earlier because they have
time to play around. I was fully competent with my MS-DOS 3.0 XT when I was 4
years old, and now I'm 16. So that's... 12 years of experience with PC's. And
why the hell should TWELVE years of experience be any less relevant than
people with 3 or 5 years experience?

The IT community feels threatened by the fact that certain kids can do their
jobs better than them, save for younger members of the community who have gone
through the same experience and can handle the fact that some-one a couple of
years younger than them is more competent. But I have to say that these people
are few and far between, and generally don't have enough power to shift the
direction of the industry in favour of young people.

The moral of the story? LOSE the ego. If a 10-year old happens to code better
C than you - FACE IT! If the IT industry were to lose its formality and start
respecting the people who make the best contributions to it regardless of age,
status, and all that other bullshit they love wasting their time on, it may
actually get somewhere. Or, it could just carry on the way it is and wait
until it fucks itself over completely before they make the change... only time
will tell.

  his terminology was quite weird, and although newbies would've understood
  it better than mine, aint no way I'm gonna write out all that crud :) ]

Basically, Iceburg has two phone lines in his house - one of which is
pre-paid (but that doesn't make a diff). When using the Ring wire from one
line and the Tip wire from the other and calling 101999 he finds that his
number is now, in fact, his neighbours phone. Simple as that. :)

He tried this at three of his friends houses and it worked on two of them.
Basically, this relies on a crap exchange and the existance of the number
your line is changing to - the first of which shouldn't be a problem if you
live in the Ghetto like most of us do, heh. :P

_.                     HAM Radio Inphoze from Sigma               ._ ,;:;,, _. 

Amateur radio is a global fraternity of people who are licensed to use two-way
radio equipment (similar to CB's) on radio frequencies specially set aside for
them to play and experiment on. Very often the technologies developed in this
hobby are applied in commercial radio communications. IMHO that is the biggest
reason why radio amateurs (also known as radio hams) are allowed exclusively
to continue playing in these precious frequency bands.

So why should you care ?

Well, amateur radio also overlaps the with computer world. If you have ever
looked around the linux kernel sources or configured a linux kernel before
compiling you are likely to have come across the AX.25 network protocols. This
specifically refers to "Packet radio"... which is a bunch of hardware and
software developed by radio amateurs to do data communications over amateur
radio.

One can link two computers by connecting them to packet-radio modems (usually
via a com port) and connecting the modem to the speaker, microphone and
push-to-talk switch of a two-way radio. Then you load up some software and
connect. Software is available for both linux and windows95 to establish
TCP/IP connections over packet radio links.

You could also be cheap and use a sound card instead of a packet modem, with
the soundmodem driver...

As you might have noticed, this setup is a little patchy, so naturally you
can't expect great data speeds. Typical data rates are around 1200 to 9600
baud. But then... if its free, and you want to transfer big files or
something, you can just let it transfer while you're sleeping. Its not like
you're paying Telkom through your nose for the time that you are online, like
us unfortunate dial-up internet users have to.

Also, I think the current south african radio act restricts data rates on
amateur frequencies to 1200 baud. The only logical reason for this to my mind
is that their monitoring equipment is so outdated that it can't handle
anything faster. But if you are willing to ignore the so-called law, you can
go for higher speeds. I see that some american companies are selling
packet-modems that run at 56kb/s. Also, another alternative is to build a
microwave link, using gunnplexors. It could be operated on the 10ghz amateur
band. I saw a article on the web somewhere of how some radio amateur
interfaced such a thing with ethernet hardware, and discovered that he gets
better throughput on this (500 meter or so) microwave link than he gets over
UTP wiring.

You could of course go for some commercial solution but you are likely to end
up paying like mad for both the hardware and the commercial radio comms
license.

If you have some knowledge of computers and electronics, the potential for
playing is unlimited. Look at what Brian Oblivion from L0pht is doing with
their guerilla net effort. They plan to use modified packet radio technology
to build an "independent internet" that consists of radio nodes. WHAT ?!?!?
.... freedom through communication that is un-censored and un-monitored by the
government !?!?!?..... tisk tisk... now *that* big brother won't like :) To
find out more check out the L0pht's wireless project on their website.

There are restrictions however, one being that what you send over the air must
be non-commercial, therefore, you could make a internet/packet radio gateway,
but then you should only use it for surfing and stuff, nothing money-making.

Ok, some more bad news. If you want to do this stuff (legally) you must at
least pass a 3 hour examination which consists of multiple guess questions on
the radio act and some basic electronics and radio comms theory. This is
called the RAE (radio amateur's examination). There are books and courses that
teach you the stuff you need to know to pass this exam.

Once you pass, you get this leet piece of paper that says you are a certified
amateur radio operator. Then you take this paper and apply to SATRA for a ham
licence. It usually takes them a few decades to process, and if you haven't
gotten shot, or died of AIDS by the time they are done processing, they give
you a licence (which includes your callsign), which you have to renew annually
for R27. Then you paste this licence on your wall, feel proud, and then get
down hacking together some leet radio comms stuff.

So, get off your lazy butt, and go speak to your local friendly radio ham
(usually the du0d with a lots of antennas on a tower in his yard). Also, you
could visit the SARL (SA Radio League) site. [Wyz: @ www.sarl.org.za I think]
To check out some leet-but-expensive equipment, go to ICOM's site Remember
though that you don't need lots of cash for this hobby, because there is lots
of cheap old equipment (esp. Ex military stuff) which can be used with little
or no modification.

Ok well, this was only meant to briefly outline what its about and why its
cool, so now the rest is up to you.

...oh... which reminds me...

For heavens sake people, please don't bug me with questions that you could
answer yourself by using a search engine on the web. Really, if you don't
learn how to teach yourself, you'll never get anywhere.

Anyway, I salute wyze1 and pneuma for keeping FK going. The zine keeps getting
better and better each time. Keep it up !

_.            The PAN Credit Card System explained by Jumpers     ._ ,;:;,, _. 

Basically all credit card numbers are known as PAN account numbers. PAN
otherwise known as Primary Account Number. This number essecitally identifies
the cardholder and card issuer. Typically this number is embossed on the front
of the card and encoded on track 2 of the magnetic stripe.

The PAN is made up of three components. These are the Issuer Identification
Number (IIN), the individual account identification which identifies the
customer and a check digit.

|                      |                           |                 |
|<--Issuer ID Number-->|<--Indiv. Account Number-->|<--Check Digit-->|
|                      |                           |                 |
|                      |                           |                 |
|  X       XXXXX       |     XXXXX---------X       |      X          | 
|                      |                           |                 |
| MII   Issuer Ident.  |    maximum 12 digits      |                 |
|                      |                           |                 | 

The IIN is made of 2 part, that is the major industry identifier(MII) and the
issuer identifier. The MII identifies the major industry of the card issuer
and normally contains one of the following digits:

MMI     Description
 0 	Still to be assigned
 1	Airlines
 2 	Airlines and other future industries
 3	Travel and Entertainment(e.g. Diners Cards)
 4	Banking/Financial(e.g. Visa)
 5 	Banking/Financial(e.g Mastercard)
 6	merchandising and banking(e.g retail private label cards like edgars etc.
 7 	Petroleum
 8 	Telecommunications and other future industries
 9 	For assignment by national standards bodies

The Issuer Identifier is normally a fixed length 5 digit number. Originally
the first number used to indicate the length of the issuer identifier, however
most new cards are now issed as a fixed lenght 5 digit number.

The individual account number is assigned by the card issuer and identifies
an individual customer account. It's normally variable in length but has a
maximum of 14 digits.

The check digit is the most important number that confirms a card. It is the
last digit of the PAN and is calculated according to the Luhn Formula which is
explained below.

Step 1: Double the value of alternate digits beginning with the	first
        right-hand digit (low order).

Step 2: Add the individual digits comprising the products obtained in Step 1
        to each of the unused digits in the original number.

Step 3: Subtract the total obtained in step 2 from the next higher number
        ending in 0. If the total obtained in step 2 is a number ending in
        zero, the check digit is 0.

Lets do an example to truly understand this.....

CC Number : 5221 3464 4004 0433 thats the complete PAN including the check
digit. CC Number we use : 5221 3464 4004 043 .....the check digit is 3

Step 1:  5  2  2  1  3  4  6  4  4  0  0  4  0  4  3  3
           x2     x2    x2    x2    x2    x2    x2    x2 
        ------------------------------------------------
            4     2     8     8     0     8     8     6

Step 2:  5+(4)+2+(2)+3+(8)+6+(8)+4+(0)+0+(8)+0+(8)+3+(6)
         = 67

Step 3:  Now subtract 67 from 70 which is the next highest number ending in 0
         70-67=3

Which confirms that the PAN number is correct therefore the credit card is
authorised.

Our major banks, that is Standard Bank, Nedbank and First National all use 16
digit PAN numbers split up into blocks of four and here are some of their
issuer id's

Nedbank : 5412 - Mastercard
Standard Bank : 5221 - Mastercard
First National Bank : 4901 - Visa

Now u may use this information in various way like for eg. say u come to a
certain website which requires age verification to enter. They use this method
to confirm if the CC number entered is correct and dont contact the banks like
we think. [Wizdumb: Although you gotta remember that potential usage of this
extends far beyond just that :P]

_.                      "Why Do we Hack?" by Hex_Edl              ._ ,;:;,, _. 

Why do we hack? Is it to alter webpages and leave some type of cybergang
inner-city graffiti? Is it to laugh in the face of over-paid, under-qualified
sysadmins? Well for myself, and everyone I associate with, the answer to both
of those would be no.

So then, why do we do it? To seek knowledge? Perhaps that is definitely an
overused and somewhat groundless excuse. We seek knowledge and wisdom every
waking moment. Every breath we inhale leases us another 3 seconds of learning.
Yes breaching a network's security does without a doubt involve learning. Yet
do we not, on occasion, breach systems using exactly the same the same method
as we have used previously? So in that case, why do we do it? If you have
broken one NT box by guessing the Administrators password, why would we do it
again to a different NT machine? Have we not already learned how to use an
IPC$ share to gain the name of the re-named Admin account? We already know how
to glean hidden shares from the aforementioned null connection. What are we
learning from repeating the task? Nothing. So why then?

I suppose the first few times, it's in the hope that you will run into a new
challenge. And sometimes we do, but is it often enough to chalk it all up to
the great quest for knowledge? I personally wonder if this is true. Maybe as
much as we shudder to admit it, it all comes down to two reasons. One is
simply because it is there, and because we can. The other is slightly more
sinister...

We are voyeurs. We want to know what interesting stuff is on the other side.
Wether we are corporate voyeurs, or peeping toms rifling through some hapless
98 users hard drive. Sir Edmond Hillary once said, when questioned as to why
he wished to climb Everest, "Simply because it is there." Are we really that
shallow? Do we do this all simply because we can? Is the great quest for
knowledge nothing more than what we tell ourselves to appease our conscience?

Yet on the other hand I feel that there must be more to it. Mabye we really do
have a primal thirst for information that isn't readily available to us.
Perhaps we have a hidden side, that no one ever sees. A side that nothing ever
senses but our keyboards. A darker vampiric, hematophagous side that thirsts
for the life-giving haemoglobin of information. A part of us so powerful it
has altered our very genetic state. Have we evolved past the majority of our
peers? Have we become demi-gods of a brave new "virtual" world?

If you could imagine for a second, that we were to carry the same abilities
and powers into the real world. What would we see? You are having and annoying
conversation with someone you dislike, in heartbeat they vanish from site. You
could instantly alter every part of your appearance, as to be totally
unrecognizable, or to appear to be someone else entirely. Any company or
person you wished, with a wave of your hand, they would lose the ability to
communicate with anyone else in the world. You could be a ghost, and
ethereally pass through any locked door or alarm system. You could grab any
piece of information you desired from that home or office, and pass back
through it's locked doors, with out any trace.

Would these abilities not elevate us above normal human status? Is coding not
the act of creation on a God like scale? "I wrote a little telnet app
yesterday" Would translate, "Well you know, it took me a couple of hours, but
I built this nifty little machine that allows me to instantly teleport myself
to anywhere in the world." If that is the translation for writing a telnet
app, what would everyone think of the guys who wrote Halflife? 

So then back to our lives in this virtual world. Are we Gods? No. To us there
is only one true God. And that is the Internet herself. All of her protocols,
and operating systems. All of her routers, switches, fiber, and servers. Every
tiny part of her, that communicate so eloquently together, as to create a
whole. A whole entire being, that we all reside within. This is our God. This
is whom we choose to worship. So what are we then my Hacker brethren? We make
up less than 1% of all who reside within. Are we priests? No, I would place
that label on the sysadmins, and helpdesk jockeys who instruct the herd.

Perhaps we are Demons? Do demons not belong to the darkside, to the anti-God?
If the Internet is our God, who is our Devil? Is it possible to have a
positive without a negative, a Ying without a Yang? We must have an anti-God,
yet what? I am not sure I know the answer. Could it be all that seek to
control her? All that seek to bend our God to their gluttonous financial and
controlling gain? It sounds plausible, and don't we battle against these
powers? Do we not war against the very idea of governments and corporations
altering our brave new world? If we are warriors of our God, would that not
make us Angels?

Thousands of years from now, our descendants may read their bible and
understand how we all fought gallantly against the forces of darkness to
ensure they lived in a world free of tyranny and oppression. They would read
how the few battled fearlessly against the many, how we couldn't fathom the
far-reaching consequences of our actions. They would marvel at how many of us
were captured and destroyed, with out even knowing why we had to fight.

So maybe we really don't need to grasp at an ethereal "why". It may all be
pre-ordained, maybe we are just meant to do what we do, and it will all be
revealed further down the long treacherous road. Then again it is possible we
are all just vitamin E deficient, socially inept humans, with a burning desire
to wreak havoc, and to feel power and respect we aren't afforded in our daily
lives.

Perhaps it is none of these things, yet that isn't for me to decide. I
personally like the idea of throwing down my gauntlet, and standing as an
avenging angel bedside my God. Ready to war against all that would seek to
harm her.

_.              Blunt Week in Review by Wyzewun and Pneuma        ._ ,;:;,, _. 

Pneuma and I had been left with no PC equipment, no telephony stuff, no
explosives, and no mental stimulation of any kind (we go to *school* for fuck
sake). So, it was decided that we should declare a Blunt week, the procedures
of which should be fairly obvious given the name. Here are a few interesting
conversations that came from the occasion...

----//

Pneuma is busy lying half passed out on a bed, eating all of the crunchie
crumbs he's spilt all over our friend's floor, not noticing our friend had
recently clipped his toe-nails in that exact place...

Pneuma:  Duuuuuuude, I just ate one of Tony's Toenails!!!
Wyzewun: Duuuuuuude, how did this short curly hair get in my crunchie?!!!
Pneuma:  Duuude, Nooooo
Wyzewun: Duuuuuuuuuuuude, Noooooooo
* Wyzewun falls of desk
(Good few hours of laughing)
Wyzewun: That was deliberate, man

----//

Wyzewun is standing above Pneuma threatening to piss on him, for some reason
no-one can remember...

Wyzewun: AHMA PISS ON YOU RIGHT HERE BITCH!@#$ OPEN YOH MOUTH!@#
* Pneuma spills his water-bottle on himself
Pneuma:  Dude... You... PEE'D on me
Pneuma:  DUDE! YOU PEE'D ON ME!
Pneuma:  (Half-Crying, Half-Laughing) Du-u-u-u-ude, you peee'd on me-e

----//

Wyzewun: What would YOU know about gang bangs?
Pneuma:  Actualy, I almost got involved in one twice
Wyzewun: Uh-huh?
Pneuma:  Well, me an my posse crew went about causing havoc on the playground
         after school, we was 7yrs old an we decided one day to play "kissing"
         catches, except, we added an interesting spin, we decided that if we
         caught one of the girls, we would gang bang her in the bathroom. Well
         we finally caught some little girl who had mad freckles everywhere,
         dragged her into the bathroom and held her down. Then I pulled off
         her panties, but when we looked at her pussy we all yelled
         "YUCK!!! EWWWWWWW!!!!!!!" and we ran away... You know whats even
         more scary, I believe I still have the panties.

( Half an hour of laughing later )

Wyzewun: Damnit nigga, I gotta do that to Marie. Just carry on chasing after
         her, and at the crucial moment... "YUCK!!! EWWWWWW!"

( Half an hour of laughing later )

Wyzewun: Oh yeh, you mentioned a second time?
Pneuma:  Well, same place, same posse crew, we decided that the part-time
         teacher there had really nice big boobies, and that we wanted to
         caress them or summing. Well, we trick the teacher into the middle
         of the playground, there by the sandpit, and we suddenly all piled
         on top of her and dragged her around the corner. We all started
         trying to pin her arms down, and when I pulled her bra off, she
         started to flip out big time, she was mad angry and stuff, du0d, I
         never seen a woman go so loco. I don't have her bra no more either.
Wyzewun: I assume thats why they wanted to give you that "corrective
         surgery" when you were a kid, huh?
Pneuma:  Y'know, It just might be so

----//

Wyzewun: Dude... In my head... Right now... There are these... Two... African
         women... Singing... And the Only words of the song... are...
         TWO NUTS, TWO NUTS, TWO NUTS, TWO NU-UTS... Dude... What should I do?

----//

*Sigh* We could continue, but we won't. Suffice to say it's been a helluva
week. We're thinking of making it an annual event, HEH. :-)
