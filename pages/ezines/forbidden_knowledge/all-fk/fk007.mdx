::   3. Attempt to play with the object as much as the object will allow    ::
::      this SID. The advantage is that the user will not be artificially   ::
::      denied access, but the app itself may have more access than it      ::

:: Hmmm, way back in yonder BBS days (which wasn't actually that long ago   ::
:: for me - I only bothered moving to the Internet about two years ago) I   ::
:: learnt how to access WWW, Gopher, FTP, etc. through e-mail. Apparently   ::
:: people don't know how to do this. =) So, I decided to write a little     ::
:: article on how to use and abuse of these services.                       ::
::                                                                          ::
:: Let's start with taking a look at accessing the web, because it is the   ::
:: most common use for the Internet, and because Agora, the software most   ::
:: commonly used to access it offline, is quite commonplace. Right, so how  ::
:: does one use an Agora server? Here's the explanation for the impatient.. ::
::                                                                          ::
:: Send mail to the Agora server (eg. agora@dna.affrc.co.jp) with a message ::
:: body that looks something like...                                        ::
::                                                                          ::

:: And thats it. Simple enough, huh? The rsend command is used in a similar ::
:: way, except that you can specify the return address, so it will send to  ::
:: whoever you want. Like so: "rsend gaypee@antionline.com URL". However,   ::
:: because this command is commonly abused, most places disable it. Like    ::
:: that really helps. :) But anyway, FTP is much better to abuse if yer     ::
:: gonna do something lame, because 30MB files are always more impressive   ::
:: than small little text-only webpages. :)                                 ::

:: Right, go forth and... errr... Waste your time on the web. =P These are  ::
:: some good Agora servers. Send a message with "help" in the subject line  ::
:: and they should cough up some decent information...                      ::

:: Most people won't modify this. Basically, it means that for the alarm to ::

:: And so our scan doesn't show up. ;P Of course, because this is a lame    ::
:: TCP/Connect Portscanner it will show up in files like /var/log/secure    ::
:: but not in the actual scanlogd logs. Were we to modify a SYN, FIN, XMAS  ::

:: that this will only work if you run my scanner with *one* thread. The    ::

:: Port Sentry is quite nice (And quite evil) in that it not only logs the  ::
:: scan, but adds the portscanner to /etc/hosts.deny so they cannot connect ::
:: to any further ports. It allows you to make a file called hosts.ignore   ::
:: so that people cannot spoof a scan as your upstream router and thus      ::
:: block your connection. BUT, you're not going to put the whole damn       ::
:: internet into your hosts.ignore, right? That's why we have killsentry.c  ::
:: by Vortexia in this issue - To show that automatic firewalling is a      ::

:: As a rule of thumb, the longer you wait, the safer you are. Got time?    ::
:: Put in a fucking 2 minute delay, screen it, and log out. Also, TCP       ::
:: portscanners like Portscan.java or any Winblows portscanner won't be     ::
:: useful against hosts that have been actively secured. Why? Well, they    ::
:: could make a script that adds all connecters to Port 1 to hosts.deny     ::
:: with a few alterations to their /etc/inetd.conf (Don't know how to do    ::
:: this? Read Vortexia's article in FK3) Also, please note that a system    ::
:: like this is more secure than Port Sentry or whatever because connect()  ::
:: portscans can't be spoofed. (Well, there are other ways to mask them,    ::
:: such as abusing WinNT's bad TCP/IP sequencing or at least spoofing DNS   ::

:: So, finally, the conclusion. You *cannot* stop people from portscanning  ::
:: you. You can get in their way, block them, send them abuse mail, do      ::
:: whatever the hell you like. But you cannot stop them. So, my suggestion  ::
