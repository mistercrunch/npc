Issue 15 already, and we still haven't an ounce of 31337ness. Oh well, thanks
to those in the scene that appreciate obstinate lameness, we couldn't have
pulled it off widdout yawl, and most of all a biggie up to muh homie Wizdumb,
widdout who you'd all be reading some popular exploit archives lamezine or
summing just as k-r4d.

Why I say this, up till now he has been producing a good four fifths of ALL
information in the ezine, a purely thankless job where he doesn't even get a
good lay outta it all, just the psuedo-satisfaction of believing that all the
hits we been getting from all over the world were actual people maybe even
reading this ezine, and not just random hits from random illiterate dumbasses.                                                     
                                                                             
Perhaps the greatest tribute to him is that people still try imitate his
psychotic way with editing, yet never quite pull it off. Or maybe just the
fact that he is still willing to write the ezine, even though we get no
feedback, no contributions and no help from the majority of our lazy,
pre-adolescent, pimply, ungrateful and rather smelly audience.

Well, here is ish 15, thats 10 plus 5 or 5 times 3, lasting longer than alot
of other ezines-that-could, kinda lingering like that godawful pig farm smell
down the road, but hopefully more pleasant. Oh, and sorry if I was a bit
harsh, the usual editor's foreword will be back next issue, I was just
soap-boxing for my peep-peep.

(By Pneuma :))

Another hack war, nation pitted against nation, protecting hacker rights and
government views. Give me the anarchists and chaotes again, these lame
Neo-nationalists, who bring their cramping, stereotypical, ignorant views
to my world make me more depressed than NOT waking up next to Carly Pope.

Anti-Chinese propoganda cunningly placed by "educated" Americans on Japanese
and Taiwanese servers. Perhaps I should hack Iraq and complain how much the US
sucks, seems to have the same affect. The Chinese aren't any better, maybe
they had an advantage over their US counterparts in the fact that their
k-leeto mass deface scripts had more chance of finding US based servers, who
knows.

Hackers, by default, would have to have a smallish anarchic streak in them, I
should hope. The mere concept of hacking for difference of government is the
single most absurd idea to hit the entire online underground scene since
winnuke.exe. I once wrote an FAQ for a security meeting I helped moderate, and
in it I said:

   "when I look at my computer it is grey and has no sex"

This is the single most driving force in my world, human emotions, especially
those, like nationalism and patriotism, directed at a multitude of people, are
ridiculous. I dunno bout everyone else, but I know my government and country
suck, and the US defending a government who took 100 people to find the
correct way to say sorry, or the Chinese who have a socialist democracy can't
be much better off.

My government and country are the very last things I would want to defend on
the net. The basic idea of the net is, as much it it pains me to make use of
such a term, a global village. It is the ultimate fresh start to civilisation,
we can form new standards of measuring entirely, most passably good hacking
crews don't recruit on gender or race, but rather skill and personality. I
have seen crews with Israeli and Arab hackers working together to find flaws
in some of the most unforgiving systems, people who work well together are an
asset to any group. The mere fact that so many people from different walks
of life are as equal as their cyber-personality is the essence of the net,
bringing together a medley of people who can do really great things without
their difference being a problem. We even need the idiots and morons around,
because some of the best help I have gotten is from these people, in their
mere banality they can bring clarity to any situation I might be in.

Here you may see a bit of hypocrisy, in that I am really a cyber-patriot,
though net-nationalism would be a bit of antithesis, but why not
cyber-patriotism, I respect no authority, and there is no real authority
online, I am not prejudiced against race or sex, and the handles I communicate
with don't often have race or sex, just letters, words, information. Asked if
I defend my cyber-world, I can gladly reply yes, given my past work done for
EHAP and my continuing advocacy of privacy and the net. I would rather defend
these bits and bytes then the sand and stone that is the foundation of the
shit-hole I am forced to live on, I could move anywhere in the world and never
feel at home, the only place I truly feel comfortable is on the net. Real
world countries and nations are set in their way now, nothing ever changes,
alliances come and go, wars break out between different tribes, the savages
make bigger weapons, always the same shit, always some dumb inbred politico
mocking the other, all the same, never different. The net is dynamic, it is
continously shifting and changing, not only am I a cyber-patriot, but I am
also an explorer to the world in which I hold allegience. I am a citizen of
the *eek* global village, I transcend offline peoples borders with the click
of a button, I know no barriers set up to prevent my identity, I defend
what I hold dear, whilst I try to comprehend it, not because of bullshit
politico propoganda, but because of honest-to-goddess authentic complexity,
the kind "us hacker types" are supposed to find intriguing and bring challenge
into our lives, not ignore and blatantly blunder about with other peoples
maps. I could end off this article saying "I am a cyber patriot, and this is
my manifesto" but I won't, instead, I feel it is homework assignment time :).
[Wizdumb: Oh dear :P]

For those who respekt dere country more den da cyber-world:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Draw a table with a horizontal split down the middle, and label the left
"Good Things about the government" and the right "Bad things about the
government" and then start at the top with the current administration, and
list a few of the most important arguments reflecting your current government.
Then after five of each or so, write the date of the previous administration
and do the same. Do this till you fill a page, then go onto the next page. By
the end of the page, you may be tempted into xeroxing the first sheet a few
hundred times and just changing the dates. This is because all government that
you defend is ALWAYS the same. You defend the unchangeable, the safe, the
inpermutable. You are unadventurous and will never find the person of your
dreams or summing, basically what I am trying to say is you defend something
that is inadequate for todays lifestyle. Government is an age old tradition,
but that doesn't mean it is a good idea, nationality is obsolete, thanks to
the internet, and there is nothing you or your KKK brothers can do about it,
pack up the double barrels, park the pick up trucks and disassemble your
posse. Old fashioned gits.

For those who know dat the net is the only territory worth defending:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Bully for you, now get involved in more cyber-patriotic stuff, hack for
net-freedom and don't support the national norm. Support actions taken by the
cyber community to prevent regulation and authority, defend privacy and the
sanctity of this territory, but most importantly, enjoy the freedom to
explore, never turn back from a challenge and make the net a social moral that
the forever bickering real world nations could someday take some inspiration
from and stop their petty squabbles. On the net, we are all just streams of
ones and zeros, which ocassionaly form ideas seen by others, most often not.
We aren't sexes, colours, races, religions etc... we have no need for
national identities and standards. Our 7 seconds impression when meeting
someone for the first time is based on personality and words, not appearances.
Who we are changes continously, who might hate us yesterday will like us
today. Our alliances and aquiantences are no longer based on who we are, but
what we can provide. Take these factors into account and make something of
yourself, and show the real world we are better.

Aight, first of all, this is not my discovery - this is something that a lot
of people in ZA know, and it has been on certain mailling lists and stuff -
I take no responsibility for it, it's public knowledge (hmmm - PK?) or,
how about, common knowledge (cK) - errmm - nevermind. Right...

--- Cut from original IOZ post ---

When dialling a cell number from a land line first dial 1007, you'll then be
asked to enter the cell number and #. The call will then be charged at Telkom
rates, not cell phone rates. Not sure how this got out, it hasn't even been
officially launched yet.

Just got off the blower to Telkom's Ingrid Krige. She says Telkom is not
prepared to talk about the service, saying it's an internal pilot. She says
anyone using the service right now will pay full fare. I asked her if 1007
is related to the interconnect dispute between Telkom and the cell phone
operators and she obfuscated. All she'd say is it's "a way of calling from
fixed lines to cell phone lines". Duh!

Methinks there's a major war brewing between Telkom and the cellular networks.
It can only be good for consumers.

--- More Stuff ---

Well as far as I know it is being routed via London due to the apparently
cheaper rates that Telkom gets. A simple observation of the manner in which
the caller ID is eliminated on the cellphone indicates an international
rerouting, as this only happens to international calls!

Received this from a mate in Telkom who is quite senior:-

More on 1007 - Telkom uses VOIP to London, then routes it back to the ITE
(international telephone exchange) in Hillbrow and thereafter into the Vodacom
network. By doing so, Telkom pays Vodacom 28c instead of R1.20. Vodacom,
naturally, is suing Telkom's ass. However, there is no legislation that says
Telkom can't do that - besides, the VANS operators are universally ignoring
the VOIP regulations...

--- Snip ---

Thanks to Terabyte for pasting all this crud to me on IRC. More interesting
still, is that the 1007 seems to be free from public phones - so if the
public phone you're using has tone-dialling, or if you have a portable
tone-dialler or a cellphone that makes DTMF tones - you're set. :->

Have fun!

_.           "Christianity: Repairing the Damage" by Wizdumb      ._ ,;:;,, _.

In other countries it's not quite as common, but in South Africa especially
(and I imagine, probably, the rest of colonial Africa as well), Christianity
is very much rooted into our society. After all, South Africa's original white
colonists were the dutch (a particular group of Christian dutch crazies, now
commonly known as "Afrikaaners" and madder than ever) and the french
Huguenots, who were also a mad Christian bunch who nobody liked, which is why
they left France.

I think Christianity is held onto very much in the third world, because it
provides a sense of security to the country's inhabitants - "It's okay -
no-one is going to come and kill us - most people here are normal - and the
Lord will protect us". This isn't as necessary in America and the like where
it's more like "They can't kill me! I'll sue! Damned stinky Mexicans! Pass the
cocaine."

But what I feel really makes the situation unbearable is the large number of
non-religious or semi-religious people who may as well just be fucking
Christians because all of their completely shallow and unmotivated ethics and
prejudices are so essentially Christian. And, like a real Christian, these
people will defend these values to the end - the words they speak coming out
of their mouth whilst blissfully unaware that the words are in fact those of
some-one they saw on TV, or at school - your words of protest passing straight
through their heads - too strange even for consideration.

People in South Africa seem to have this attitude that Christianity is a
"norm" of sorts, which I find completely absurd - surely this completely mad,
meaningless and contradictory religion isn't something that people should be
expected to subscribe to by default? And this is where I feel that the danger
lies - in the fact that Christianity is so deeply imbedded into our way of
life that people fall victim to it without even knowing, and before they even
start thinking about existential issues they have been taught not to think for
themselves - but it's allright - the answers are all here in this k-r4d fuckin
*book* that you can *buy*, and it gives *instant* meaning to your life - isn't
that cool?

Worse yet, is when Christianity deliberately stands in the way of world
progress for the sake of their meaningless values. The Pope is talking to
President Bush about not allowing a research project which involves
experiments on human embryos which could yield cures for many diseases - and
why? Because it degrades human life. Oh, ummm, okay, that makes perfect sense
to me. :/

Christianity is more than just an insane thing that some people seem to get
pre-occupied with - it is a threat to rational thought and the world as we
know it. :-) Perhaps it's time for you to take serious action against it -
spray-paint a church, give the old vicar some of your old porn zines you don't
want anymore ("What's this? 'Banging Butts'-?, Hmmm..."), get hopelessly drunk
with your friends and then go to church, whatever you feel like - just try and
get these people to realise how completely ridiculous they are before it's too
late. :-)

Okay, that's all... ;-P

_.  "Detecting a Phone-Tap in 21st Century South Africa" by Pneuma._ ,;:;,, _.

Alot of people believe that the police and other agencies are getting more
sophisticated in their surveilance techniques, and that detecting a phone
line tap nowadays is next to impossible. I will now dispel these beliefs
with a quick and simple technique to detect a phone tap, step by step.

Yes, it is still possible to guess at a tap by random interference with
your phone system, but the more sophisticated phone taps have a complex
method of manifestation. First a little background... in the early 90's
the police forces attended a InterPol meeting where surveilance was
discussed and it was suggested that a "server side" phone tap be employed,
where the actual recording devices were stored at the Telecom centres and
the law enforcement agencies wouldn't need to stand on poles or enter
homes. This idea was never implemented due to the fact that the telecom
staff all over the world are pretty dodgy and would be able to disclose
phone tap information, not to mention the required warrants would have to
be used, making the quick and covert phone tap impossible. Secondly,
surveilance employs secretive measures, making sure that the victim... I
mean *SUSPECT*... never has an inkling to whats going on, therefore a home
entry method would also be a strict no no. Therefore a intercepted line
phone tap is still the most commonly used method. Now, below is a really
great ascii artwork detailing such a phone tap.
 
			 o888o
 Telecom <<======\\=======|0| Home Phone Line
	A)       ||              B)
	       |----|
	       |BUG | C)
	       ------

Ok, ok, so my ascii art is awful, cyberphreak, damn you!@!@!!@#@!

Here are the main points though:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A) Telecom Network
B) Your line
C) The amazing recording-box-thingy-majig.

To connect such a phone tap, the agency would have to cut away part of the
covering of the phone wire and connect the box to the wires. This is the first
indication, a phone tap produces a small amount of charge into the phone, a
common wiretap therefore follows this MO:

i) The phone line will be disconnected for several hours, this is due to the
   sophisticated method of stripping the wire with a garden shear.

ii) There will be crackling on the line for some time once it is back up. The
    reason is that such equipment is VERY sensitive, and when they don't close
    the cover properly, water and moisture leak in and cause static discharges
    and faulty connections.

iii) Next you will hear an echo for anything from a few milliseconds to 10
     seconds, though I have had one that lasted a good 30 seconds and when I
     hung up and foned someone else I heard the tail end of my previous
     conversation. This echo is the direct result of the complexity of a
     digital phone tap, when the wires are not connected strictly as detailed,
     the unit will feed parts of the conversation back to the line.

iv) At times you might hear strange beeps, or even a high pitched squeal, the
    units complexity involves a storage medium as well, as if the agents
    didn't have to deal with enough already. When the storage medium, tape for
    analogue taps and memory chip for digital, runs out of recordable area,
    the unit will sound to alert agents to the need to replace it, this is
    most commonly heard on units that have been connected as detailed in
    section (iii).

v) Another common way to tell if you have been bugged is very subtle, and
   involves you phoning your own line from a cellular phone or someone else
   phoning you, you should hear a small beep, and then nothing, whilst the
   calling party reports that the phone rings once then goes dead. The cause
   for this is that certain bugs have a voltage selection, or only react to
   certain frequencies, this, if incorrectly attached, can kill alot of tones,
   ie. phone ring tone. This is mainly the case of digital phone taps made to
   sniff data traffic.

What to do once you have cleverly detected a well hidden phone tap:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is up to you, I usually blotto box my own line (unplug modem and
telephones first though) and watch red faced telecom technicians spend hours
finding the reason why certain lines are out of service. The last time though
I just phoned my telecom from a pay phone and they came and removed "a funny
electrical box" and asked if I put it there, I responded I didn't but could I
have it, they said no, its not mine then, it's probably still stuck in some
Telkom basement, befuzzling the feds endlessly.

_.      "Meeting Rawdata" and other Tales of Insanity by Wizdumb  ._ ,;:;,, _.

Friday night - Pneuma and I haven't planned anything interesting, and
"Rawdata" - this funny russian kid we know from #hack, is trying to convince
us to go to some arb house-party with him. We had met him only once before,
and quite briefly, but we knew that he was some completely crazy occultist
haxx0r kiddie, and we had nothing to do, so we figured it'd be interesting.

I convince my housemate, John, to give us a lift out to Rawdata's house in
Roodepoort in his car. Okay, ummm, a bit of necessary background on John's
car - wish I had a picture of it for y'all - it's a cream-coloured Ford
Meteor with a black panel - the interior is a veritable pit of filth, as
John likes to keep it - there used to be this funny white fungus growing all
over the floor of the back seat, but this other funny neon-orange fungus
started growing there and now it's gone. Anyway - we've spraypainted it a
bit - there's this crazy skull on the bonnet, and a racing stripe with a
"666", lot's of pentagrams n upside down crosses, and the one side of the car
says "WAR CAR". Needless to say, we've seen many interesting reactions to it
from passers-by, including a group of mad Christians who jumped out of an
unlicensed car and attacked John with tasers. ;-P But this story isn't
about that - it's about one guy's reaction in particular - dear old
Rawdata. :)

So we drive all the way out to Roodepoort from my house, which is quite a 
hefty drive, and we arrive outside the internet cafe Rawdata told us to meet
him at (he's scared of having us in his house - near his parents ;p).

After a phone-call, Rawdata is walking down the road towards with his
friend Creamy, who's this other russian haxx0r kidlet du0d. Rawdata is in
love with Cradle of Filth and Marilyn Manson, and is quite a, ermm, dark
fellow. ;) Him and his friend get into the car and one of the first things
Rawdata asks is "What the hell is this?" (indicating the car)

"Uuuh, It's the War Car, man."
Really, Can't you *read* the side? ;P
"Does this thing work?"
"Uuuuh, yea, of course, it goes good."

We can see Rawdata is a bit nervous about being in this crazy car with these
crazies, but he doesn't mention anything more yet. Pneuma asks him about the
party.

"Well," Rawdata says "We have a choice - There's a big party near the Sundome
and there's this chick's party somewhere around here."

"What big party?"
"I don't know - I just know there's something near the Sundome."
"So you don't actually know where or what it is?"
"Uuuh, yeah, but like I was saying, we have a choice."
"Errr, okay, what about this chick's house-party then?"
"Uuuh, we don't have the address."
"So, basically, what you're saying, is that we have two options - but neither
of them are an option?"

This one caught him for a bit. We start trying to formulate a plan, and drive
around aimlessly a bit, just for fun. It's not long before Rawdata's paranoia
explodes and he's telling us to drop him off again - his friend is telling
him to stop being such a gay and he's not co-operating.

"We're going to die!! - Look at this!!"
The Bong in my hand.
"Look at this!!!"
The Weed in my lap.
"Look at this!!"
The, err, broken cubby-hole.
"Look at this!!!"
John's septum piercing.
"No, wait, umm, that's pretty cool. Yes, umm, I like that."

So he's freaking out, and his friend is telling him to calm down, but he
doesn't, and although we considered kidnapping him we didn't have the energy,
and we let him out of the car. *Sigh*. He apologised profusely for it on IRC
all through the next week - ("weed makes him paranoid" - ie. seeing it), and
"the War Car rocks" - *Yawn* I don't have enough energy to carry on talking
about this completely strange and insane dude - suffice to say I don't know
what's wrong with the youth of today. ;-)

So I get this "Please Call Me" SMS from some number I don't know one day at
work. But, because I'm at work and don't actually have anything better to do,
I decide to call it up, and the dumb dutchman dude who answers tells me that
he didn't send me a call me, and that he might have sent one by mistake, coz
he's sending them to lot's of people. *Sigh* Okay, cool, whatever. Later that
evening, another SMS...
                                                                              
"me again, you ever gotten a gold box to work in ZA? all the nfo on net r 4
 US&UK systems, plz shout if you got info, pjkilla98@webmail.co.za"

Huh? 10 minutes later, another SMS...                                      
                                                                              
"hey wyz1. i sent you a plzcallme 2day,sorry,me bud wez (next 2 wyz1 in
 phonebook). when's next FK coming out?"

Ok, so so far, so he's made me fone him pointlessly, asked me some lame crap
about gold boxing, and the dreaded and infinitely tabboo "When's the next FK
coming out?" question. And why the fuq am I in his phonebook?!!
                                                                              
*Sigh* The next morning, this e-mail...

Ermm, subz as in subMISSIONz - if you read the zine you would know that we
have an automated subscription address so that we don't have to listen to
your gay banter - then again, if he read the zine, he'd know when the next
issue is out - this guy is purely out to publically embarass himself.

So I write back to the idiot with a simple and direct "Leave us alone!!" and I
get this response later during the day...

Time to be a bit more direct...

"I didn't tell you not to contact me because I was trying to be funny, I was
 telling you because I meant it. You annoy me. I hate you. Go away."

Psheesh. :)

_.           Outro: "FK: Past, Present, and Future" by Wizdumb    ._ ,;:;,, _.

This article will address certain questions such as "What is FK?" and "Why do
you waste your time on it?" frequently asked by, well, errr, me.

The original "Forbidden Knowledge" e-zine, believe it or not, was a
single-page .rtf zine about extra-terrestrial visitations which I made four
issues of and never released. I later re-started FK as a H/P zine, spelling it
"f0rbidden knowledge" to differentiate it from the previous zine to myself. :)
I later ditched the l33t sp33q coz Vortexia told me it was unel8. :(

The first two issues of f0rbidden knowledge were written, in their entirety,
by myself. I stole ideas from Pneuma & Gevil and wrote the articles as them
because I was pretty sure that they wouldn't write them themselves if I asked
them. The SoS (Sons of Satan/Saviours of Systems) was my first "hacking crew"
as such, and although some people seemed to begin to think that we actually
did anything, we mostly just handed little hand-written newsletters to
eachother at school ("SoS News") - painstakingly copying out each newsletter
twice (one for each other member :P).

I can't remember what most of these were about - Pneuma still has some - but
they were mostly just arb stuff like talking about reviving our local 2600
meetings, and a few talking about starting this gay e-zine in which we could
publish all our uber-l33t findings and greet every person and group we had
read textfiles by ever, heh.

Originally, I made FK just to look uber-k1ef in the scene, later realising
that this was dumb, but that I had gained a nice tool for propoganda - which
is why we (Me & Pneuma) are currently perpetuating the zine. We've long since
lost interest in having high-quality technical articles - because the idea is
just silly.

Look at Phrack for example - they release some of the H/P zine scene's best
technical articles - and what good does it do for them? They release an issue
once a century, and nobody likes them even though they're obviously the
"best". Unlikely as my zine is to get me sex ever, route's is even less likely
to get him laid. ;-P But I suppose that's probably besides the point... :>

Just, before you whine about the zine's content - please consider that this is
not a "hack" zine, this is a Evil-Propoganda-To-Destroy-Your-Mind zine, and
nothing else. Besides, those of you who think the hacking scene exists at all
have some serious issues to consider. :P

As for the "future" bit - well, to be honest, I just included it in the title
coz it made it sound cooler - who knows what the future holds for FK?
Eventually, maybe, when I'm rich enough, or when some-one makes me an offer,
I will complete the cycle and diversify FK to death as a hard-copy zine - of
course, I'll probably still have the PDF freely downloadable online, because
y'all haxx0r kiddies have warped my brain /w all your "inf0rmat1on w4ntz 2 b
phr3e" bullocks. ;-)

Also, Electromagnetic Interference will still be happening and will r0q your
w0rld like you never imagined possible - be prepared. :->
