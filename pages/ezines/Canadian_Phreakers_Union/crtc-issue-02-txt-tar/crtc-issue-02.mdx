"Fun With Telus VMB's"

By: tekk250 (tek-know@phreaker.net)
Date: Oct. 9, 2001

~ INTRO
This text simply describes how to scan for Telus VMB's and
send messages directly to other Telus VMB's
(VMB = Voicemail Box)

1) Accessing VMB's
There are two ways that I know of to access Telus VMB's. 
 
The first one is the older way, by dialing 
881-9000.  If there is a VMB set up for the line you will hear
a recording of the user saying their name, then will be prompted 
to enter is the correct 4 digit passcode.  If there is no VMB set 
up on the line you will have to hit # followed the phone number of 
the VMB you wish to access.  After entering in the number you will 
hear the user's recording then will be prompted to enter the passcode.

The second way is to access the VMB is by pressing *98 from a line with 
a VMB.  If there isn't one on that line you will simply hear "We're sorry 
this call cannot be completed as dialed".  If there is one on the line 
you will go through the same procedure as above.

2) Sending Out Messages to Other VMBs

It is very easy to find other lines with mailboxes, by using the VMB you 
are currently in.  After accessing a VMB you can simply press 2.  You 
will then be prompted to record a message.  After doing so press 1 to 
hear it and # to send it.
You will then be asked to enter the "destination mailbox number". 
After this you are set to send out the message.
This will not cause the phone to ring at the specified mailbox, the message
will simply be leftin the mailbox.

3) Scanning for other VMBs

Using the above 881 9000 procedure above you can simply scan for VMB's.  
After entering 881 9000 you will be prompted to enter in a mailbox in 
the (XXX) XXX-XXXX format.  You will then either hear the users recording 
or a message telling you there is no mailbox at the target number.  Lord 
knows why you'd wan to do this but hey you may find your own reasons.

	Government Emergency Telephone System ACT --


Sec. 0.01.  This Act  shall  be  known  and  may  be  cited  as  the
"Emergency Telephone System Act".
(Source: P.A. 85-978.)

    Sec. 1.  The General Assembly finds and declares that it is  in  the
public  interest  to  shorten the time required for a citizen to request
and receive emergency aid.  There currently exist thousands of different
emergency phone numbers throughout  the  state,  and  present  telephone
exchange  boundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily
correspond to public safety and political boundaries.   Provision  of  a
single,  primary  three-digit  emergency  number through which emergency
services can  be  quickly  and  efficiently  obtained  would  provide  a
significant  contribution  to  law  enforcement and other public service
efforts by making it less difficult  to  quickly  notify  public  safety
personnel.  Such a simplified means of procuring emergency services will
result  in  the  saving  of  life,  a  reduction  in  the destruction of
property, quicker apprehension of criminals, and ultimately  the  saving
of  money.   The  General  Assembly  further finds and declares that the
establishment of a uniform, statewide emergency number is  a  matter  of
statewide  concern  and interest to all inhabitants and citizens of this
State.  It is the purpose of this Act to establish the number "9-1-1" as
the primary emergency telephone number for use  in  this  State  and  to
encourage  units  of  local government and combinations of such units to
develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities in
such a manner as to be able to quickly respond to any person calling the
telephone number "9-1-1" seeking  police,  fire,  medical,  rescue,  and
other emergency services.
(Source: P.A. 85-978.)

    Sec. 2.  As  used  in  this  Act,  the  terms  defined  in  Sections

    Sec. 3. Every local public agency in a county having 100,000 or more
inhabitants, within its respective  jurisdiction,  shall  establish  and
have  in  operation  within  3 years after the implementation date or by
December 31, 1985, whichever is later, a basic or  sophisticated  system
as  specified  in  this Act.  Other public agencies may establish such a
system, and shall be entitled to participate in any program of grants or
other State funding of such systems.

    The establishment of such systems shall be centralized to the extent
feasible.  Nothing in  this  Act  shall  be  construed  to  prohibit  or
discourage  in  any way the formation of multijurisdictional or regional
systems, and any system established pursuant to this Act may include the
territory of more than one public agency or may include a segment of the
territory of a public agency.
(Source: P.A. 81-1509.)

    Sec. 4.   Every  system  shall  include  police,  firefighting,  and
emergency   medical  and  ambulance  services,  and  may  include  other
emergency services, in the  discretion  of  the  affected  local  public
agency,  such  as  poison control services, suicide prevention services,
and  civil  defense  services.   The  system  may  incorporate   private
ambulance  service.   In  those areas in which a public safety agency of
the state provides such emergency services,  the  system  shall  include
such public safety agencies.
(Source: P.A. 79-1092.)

    Sec. 5.  The digits "9-1-1" shall be the primary emergency telephone

sophisticated,  shall be designed to have the capability of utilizing at
least 1 of the methods specified in  Sections   2.03  through  2.06,  in
response  to  emergency  calls.  The General Assembly finds and declares
that the most critical aspect  of  the  design  of  any  system  is  the
procedure  established  for  handling  a telephone request for emergency
services.

    In addition, to maximize efficiency and utilization of  the  system,
all  pay  telephones  within each system shall, within 3 years after the
implementation date or by December 31, 1985, whichever is later,  enable
a caller to dial "9-1-1" for emergency services without the necessity of
inserting  a  coin.   This  paragraph  does  not apply to pay telephones
located in penal  institutions,  as  defined  in  Section  2-14  of  the
Criminal  Code  of 1961, that have been designated for the exclusive use
of committed persons.
(Source: P.A. 91-518, eff. 8-13-99.)

readily  accessible  to  hearing-impaired and voice-impaired individuals
through the use of telecommunications  technology  for  hearing-impaired
and speech-impaired individuals.
    As used in this Section:

         "Hearing-impaired  individual"  means a person with a permanent
    hearing  loss  who  can  regularly  and  routinely  communicate   by
    telephone only through the aid of devices which can send and receive
    written messages over the telephone network.

         "Voice-impaired  individual"  means  a  person with a permanent
    speech  disability  which  precludes  oral  communication,  who  can
    regularly and routinely communicate by telephone  only  through  the
    aid  of devices which can send and receive written messages over the
    telephone network.

         "Telecommunications technology" means equipment that  can  send
    and receive written messages over the telephone network.
   (Source: P.A. 87-146.)

    Sec. 7.  The General Assembly finds  that,  because  of  overlapping
jurisdiction  of  public  agencies, public safety agencies and telephone
service areas, the Commission shall establish a general overview or plan
to effectuate the purposes of this Act within the time frame provided in
this Act.  In order to insure that proper preparation and implementation
of emergency telephone systems are accomplished by all  public  agencies
in  a county having 100,000 or more inhabitants within 3 years after the
implementation date or by December 31, 1985,  whichever  is  later,  the
Commission,  with  the  advice  and  assistance of the Attorney General,
shall secure compliance by public agencies as provided in this Act.
(Source: P.A. 81-1122.)

    Sec. 8.  The Commission, with  the  advice  and  assistance  of  the
Attorney   General,  shall  coordinate  the  implementation  of  systems
established under  this  Act.   The  Commission,  with  the  advice  and
assistance  of  the Attorney General, shall assist local public agencies
and  local  public  safety  agencies  in  obtaining  financial  help  to
establish emergency telephone service, and shall aid  such  agencies  in
the  formulation of concepts, methods, and procedures which will improve
the operation of systems required by this Act and  which  will  increase
cooperation between public safety agencies.
(Source: P.A. 79-1092.)

    Sec. 9.  To accomplish the responsibilities specified in  this  Act,
the  Commission  is  directed  to  consult at regular intervals with the
State Fire Marshal, the Department of Public Health, the  Department  of
Transportation,  the  public utilities in this State providing telephone
service, the Department of State  Police,  and  the  State  Division  of
Forestry.   Such  agencies  shall  provide  all necessary assistance and
consultation to the Commission  to  enable  it  to  perform  its  duties
specified in this Act.
(Source: P.A. 84-25.)

    Sec. 10.  Technical and operational standards for the development of
the local agency systems  shall  be  established  and  reviewed  by  the
Commission  on  or before December 31, 1979, after consultation with all
agencies specified in Section 9.
(Source: P.A. 79-1092.)

    Sec. 10.1.  9-1-1 information consisting  of  names,  addresses  and
telephone   numbers  of  telephone  customers  whose  listings  are  not
published in directories or listed in Directory  Assistance  Offices  is
confidential.    Information  shall  be provided on a call-by-call basis
only for the purpose of responding to emergency calls.
    Divulging confidential information in violation of this Section is a
Class A misdemeanor.
(Source: P.A. 87-146.)

    Sec. 10.2.  The Emergency  Telephone  System  Board  in  any  county
passing  a referendum under Section 15.3, and the Chairman of the County
Board in any county implementing a 9-1-1 system shall  ensure  that  all
areas of the county are included in the system.
(Source: P.A. 87-146.)

    Sec. 10.3.  Notice  of  address  change.   The  Emergency  Telephone
System  Board in any county implementing a 9-1-1 system that changes any
person's address (when the person whose  address  has  changed  has  not
moved  to  a new residence)  shall notify the person (i) of the person's
new address and (ii) that the person should contact the  local  election
authority to determine if the person should re-register to vote.
(Source: P.A. 90-664, eff. 7-30-98.)

    Sec. 11. Within one year after the implementation date or by January
31, 1980, whichever is later, all public agencies  in  a  county  having
100,000  or  more  inhabitants  shall  submit  tentative  plans  of  the
establishment  of a system required by this Act to the public utility or
utilities providing  public  telephone  service  within  the  respective
jurisdiction  of  each public agency.  A copy of each such plan shall be
filed with the Commission.

    Within 2 years after the implementation date or by January 31, 1982,
whichever is later, all public agencies in a county  having  100,000  or
more  inhabitants  shall submit final plans for the establishment of the
system  to  such  utilities,  and  shall  make  arrangements  with  such
utilities for the implementation  of  the  planned  emergency  telephone
system  no  later  than  3  years  after  the  implementation date or by
December 31, 1985, whichever is later.  A copy of the plan  required  by
this  subdivision shall be filed with the Commission. In order to secure
compliance  with  the  standards  promulgated  under  Section  10,   the
Commission  shall  have  the  power  to approve or disapprove such plan,
unless such plan was announced before the effective date of this Act.

    If any public agency has implemented  or  is  a  part  of  a  system
required  by  this  Act  on  a  deadline specified in this Section, such
public agency shall submit in lieu of the  tentative  or  final  plan  a
report describing the system and stating its operational date.
    Plans  filed  under  this Section shall conform to minimum standards
established pursuant to Section 10.
(Source: P.A. 81-1122.)

    Sec. 12.  The Attorney General may, in behalf of the  Commission  or
on   his  own  initiative,  commence  judicial  proceedings  to  enforce
compliance by any public agency or public  utility  providing  telephone
service with this Act.
(Source: P.A. 79-1092.)

    Sec. 13.  On or before February 16, 1979, and  again  on  or  before
February  16,  1981, the Commission shall report to the General Assembly
the progress in the implementation of  systems  required  by  this  Act.
Such   reports   shall   contain   his  recommendations  for  additional
legislation.

    In December of 1979 and in December of 1980 the Commission, with the
advice  and  assistance  of   the   Attorney   General,   shall   submit
recommendations  to  the  Bureau  of  the  Budget  and  to  the Governor
specifying amounts necessary to further implement  the  organization  of
telephone  systems  specified  in  this Act during the succeeding fiscal
year.   The  report  specified  in  this  paragraph  shall  contain,  in
addition, an estimate of the fiscal  impact  to  local  public  agencies
which will be caused by implementation of this Act.

    By  March  1  in  1979 and every even-numbered year thereafter, each
telephone company shall file  a  report  with  the  Commission  and  the
General  Assembly  specifying,  in  such detail as the Commission has by
rule or regulation required, the extent to which it  has  implemented  a
planned   emergency   telephone   system   and   its  projected  further
implementation of such a system.

    The requirement for reporting  to  the  General  Assembly  shall  be
satisfied  by filing copies of the report with the Speaker, the Minority
Leader and the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the  President,
the  Minority Leader and the Secretary of the Senate and the Legislative
Research Unit, as required by Section 3.1 of "An Act to revise  the  law
in  relation  to  the  General Assembly", approved February 25, 1874, as
amended, and filing such additional copies  with  the  State  Government
Report Distribution Center for the General Assembly as is required under
paragraph (t) of Section 7 of the State Library Act.
(Source: P.A. 84-1438.)

    Sec. 14.  The General Assembly declares  that  a  major  purpose  in
enacting  this  Act  is  to  eliminate  instances  in which a responding
emergency service refuses to render aid to  the  requester  because  the
requester  is  outside of the jurisdictional boundaries of the emergency
service.  Therefore, in implementing systems under this Act, all  public
agencies in a single system shall enter into a joint powers agreement or
any other form of written cooperative agreement which is applicable when
need  arises  on  a  day-to-day  basis.   Certified  notification of the
continuation of such agreements shall be made among the involved parties
on an annual basis.  In addition, such agreements shall be entered  into
between  public  agencies  and  public safety agencies which are part of
different systems but whose jurisdictional  boundaries  are  contiguous.
The  agreements shall provide that, once an emergency unit is dispatched
in response to a request through the system, such unit shall render  its
services  to  the requesting party without regard to whether the unit is
operating outside its normal jurisdictional boundaries.
(Source: P.A. 86-101.)

    Sec. 15.  Copies of the annual certified notification of  continuing
agreement  required  by  Section  14  shall  be  filed with the Attorney
General and the Commission.  Commencing with the  year  1987,  all  such
agreements  shall  be  so  filed  prior to the 31st day of January.  The
Attorney  General  shall  commence  judicial  proceedings   to   enforce
compliance  with  this  Section and Section 14, where a public agency or
public safety agency has failed to timely enter into such  agreement  or

    Sec. 15.3.  (a) The corporate authorities of any municipality or any
county may, subject to the limitations of subsections (c), (d), and (h),
and in addition to any tax levied pursuant  to  Section  8-11-2  of  the
Illinois   Municipal   Code,   impose  a  monthly  surcharge  on  billed
subscribers of network connection provided by telecommunication carriers
engaged in the business of transmitting messages by means of electricity
originating within the corporate limits of the  municipality  or  county
imposing  the  surcharge  at a rate per network connection determined in
accordance with subsection  (c).   A  municipality  may  enter  into  an
intergovernmental  agreement  with  any  county in which it is partially
located, when the county has adopted an ordinance to impose a  surcharge
as   provided  in  subsection  (c),  to  include  that  portion  of  the
municipality  lying  outside  the  county  in  that  county's  surcharge
referendum.  If the  county's  surcharge  referendum  is  approved,  the
portion   of   the  municipality  identified  in  the  intergovernmental
agreement shall automatically be disconnected from the county  in  which
it  lies  and  connected to the county which approved the referendum for
purposes of a surcharge on telecommunications carriers.

(b)  For purposes of computing the surcharge imposed  by  subsection
(a), the network connections to which the surcharge shall apply shall be
those   in-service   network   connections,  other  than  those  network
connections assigned to the municipality or county,  where  the  service
address  for  each  such  network  connection  or connections is located
within the corporate limits of the municipality or  county  levying  the
surcharge.  The "service address" shall mean the location of the primary
use of the network connection or connections. With  respect  to  network
connections provided for use with pay telephone services for which there
is  no  billed  subscriber, the telecommunications carrier providing the
network connection shall be deemed to be its own billed  subscriber  for
purposes of applying the surcharge.

(c)  Upon  the  passage  of an ordinance to impose a surcharge under
this Section the clerk of the municipality or county shall  certify  the
question  of whether the surcharge may be imposed to the proper election
authority who shall submit the public question to the  electors  of  the
municipality  or  county  in  accordance  with the general election law;
provided that such question shall not be  submitted  at  a  consolidated
primary  election.   The  public  question shall be in substantially the
following form:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Shall the county (or city, village
or incorporated town) of.....impose          YES
a surcharge of up to...ó per month per
network connection, which surcharge will
be added to the monthly bill you receive   -----------------------------
for telephone or telecommunications
charges, for the purpose of installing
(or improving) a 9-1-1 Emergency             NO
Telephone System?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If a majority of the votes cast upon  the  public  question  are  in
favor thereof, the surcharge shall be imposed.
    However,  if  a  Joint  Emergency  Telephone  System  Board is to be
created pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement under  Section  15.4,
the  ordinance  to impose the surcharge shall be subject to the approval
of a majority of the total number of votes cast upon the public question
by the electors of all of the municipalities or counties, or combination
thereof, that are parties to the intergovernmental agreement.

    The referendum requirement of this subsection (c) shall not apply to
any municipality with a population over 500,000  or  to  any  county  in
which  a  proposition  as  to  whether  a  sophisticated 9-1-1 Emergency
Telephone System should be installed in the county, at  a  cost  not  to
exceed a specified monthly amount per network connection, has previously
been  approved by a majority of the electors of the county voting on the
proposition at an election conducted before the effective date  of  this
amendatory Act of 1987.

    (d)  A  county  may  not  impose  a surcharge, unless requested by a
municipality, in any incorporated area which has previously  approved  a
surcharge  as  provided  in  subsection  (c) or in any incorporated area
where the corporate authorities  of  the  municipality  have  previously
entered   into   a   binding   contract  or  letter  of  intent  with  a
telecommunications  carrier  to  provide  sophisticated  9-1-1   service
through municipal funds.

    (e)  A  municipality  or  county may at any time by ordinance change
the rate of the surcharge imposed under this Section  if  the  new  rate
does  not  exceed  the rate specified in the referendum held pursuant to
subsection (c).

    (f)  The surcharge authorized by this  Section  shall  be  collected
from  the  subscriber  by  the  telecommunications carrier providing the
subscriber the network connection as a separately  stated  item  on  the
subscriber's bill.

    (g)  The  amount  of  surcharge  collected by the telecommunications
carrier shall be paid to the particular municipality or county or  Joint
Emergency  Telephone  System  Board  not  later  than  30 days after the
surcharge  is  collected,  net  of  any  network  or  other   9-1-1   or
sophisticated   9-1-1   system   charges   then   due   the   particular
telecommunications   carrier,   as  shown  on  an  itemized  bill.   The
telecommunications  carrier  collecting  the  surcharge  shall  also  be
entitled to deduct 3% of the gross  amount  of  surcharge  collected  to
reimburse  the  telecommunications carrier for the expense of accounting
and collecting the surcharge.

    (h)  A municipality with a population over 500,000 may not impose  a
monthly surcharge in excess of $1.25 per network connection.

    (i)  Any  municipality or county or joint emergency telephone system
board that has imposed a surcharge pursuant to this Section prior to the
effective date of this amendatory Act of 1990 shall hereafter impose the
surcharge in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section.

    (j)  The corporate authorities of any  municipality  or  county  may
issue,   in   accordance  with  Illinois  law,  bonds,  notes  or  other
obligations secured in whole or in part by the proceeds of the surcharge
described in this Section.  Notwithstanding any change in law subsequent
to the issuance of any bonds, notes or other obligations secured by  the
surcharge,  every  municipality  or  county issuing such bonds, notes or
other obligations shall be authorized to impose the surcharge as  though
the  laws  relating  to the imposition of the surcharge in effect at the
time of issuance of the bonds, notes or other obligations were  in  full
force and effect until the bonds, notes or other obligations are paid in
full. The State of Illinois pledges and agrees that it will not limit or
alter  the  rights  and  powers vested in municipalities and counties by
this Section to impose the surcharge so as to impair  the  terms  of  or
affect  the  security  for  bonds, notes or other obligations secured in
whole or in part with the proceeds of the surcharge  described  in  this
Section.

    (k)  Any  surcharge  collected by or imposed on a telecommunications
carrier pursuant to this Section shall be held to be a special  fund  in
trust  for  the  municipality, county or Joint Emergency Telephone Board
imposing the  surcharge.   Except  for  the  3%  deduction  provided  in
subsection  (g)  above,  the  special  fund  shall not be subject to the
claims of creditors of the telecommunication carrier.

    Sec. 15.4.  Emergency Telephone System Board; powers.
    (a)  The corporate authorities of any county  or  municipality  that
imposes  a  surcharge  under  Section  15.3 shall establish an Emergency
Telephone System Board.  The corporate authorities shall provide for the
manner of appointment and the number of members of the  Board,  provided
that  the  board  shall consist of not fewer than 5 members, one of whom
may be a public member who is a resident of the local  exchange  service
territory  included in the 9-1-1 coverage area, one of whom (in counties
with a population less than 100,000) may  be  a  member  of  the  county
board,  and  at  least  3  of  whom shall be representative of the 9-1-1
public safety agencies, including but not limited to police departments,
fire departments, emergency medical services  providers,  and  emergency
services  and  disaster  agencies,  and  appointed on the basis of their
ability or experience.  Elected officials are also eligible to serve  on
the  board.   Members  of the board shall serve without compensation but
shall be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses.  Any  2  or
more  municipalities,  counties,  or  combination thereof, that impose a
surcharge under Section 15.3 may,  instead  of  establishing  individual
boards,  establish  by  intergovernmental  agreement  a  Joint Emergency
Telephone  System  Board  pursuant  to  this  Section.   The  manner  of
appointment of such a joint board shall be prescribed in the agreement.

    (b)  The powers  and  duties  of  the  board  shall  be  defined  by
ordinance  of  the  municipality  or  county,  or  by  intergovernmental
agreement  in  the  case  of a joint board.  The powers and duties shall
include, but need not be limited to the following:

         (1)  Planning a 9-1-1 system.

         (2)  Coordinating   and   supervising    the    implementation,

    15.3, and from any other source,  for  deposit  into  the  Emergency
    Telephone System Fund.

         (4)  Authorizing all disbursements from the fund.

         (5)  Hiring  any  staff  necessary  for  the  implementation or
    upgrade of the system.

    (c)  All monies received by a board pursuant to a surcharge  imposed
under  Section  15.3 shall be deposited into a separate interest-bearing
Emergency  Telephone  System  Fund  account.  The   treasurer   of   the
municipality or county that has established the board or, in the case of
a  joint  board,  any  municipal  or  county treasurer designated in the
intergovernmental agreement,  shall  be  custodian  of  the  fund.   All
interest accruing on the fund shall remain in the fund.  No expenditures
may  be  made  from  such fund except upon the direction of the board by
resolution  passed  by  a  majority  of  all  members  of   the   board.
Expenditures  may  be made only to pay for the costs associated with the
following:

         (1)  The design of the Emergency Telephone System.

         (2)  The coding of an initial Master Street Address Guide  data
    base, and update and maintenance thereof.

         (3)  The   repayment   of   any   monies   advanced   for   the
    implementation of the system.

         (4)  The   charges  for  Automatic  Number  Identification  and
    Automatic  Location  Identification  equipment,  a  computer   aided
    dispatch system that records, maintains, and integrates information,
    mobile  data  transmitters equipped with automatic vehicle locators,
    and  maintenance,  replacement  and  update  thereof   to   increase
    operational  efficiency  and  improve  the  provision  of  emergency
    services.

         (5)  The  non-recurring  charges related to installation of the
    Emergency Telephone System and the ongoing network charges.

         (6)  The acquisition and installation, or the reimbursement  of
    costs therefor to other governmental bodies that have incurred those
    costs,   of   road  or  street  signs  that  are  essential  to  the
    implementation of the emergency telephone system and  that  are  not
    duplicative of signs that are the responsibility of the jurisdiction
    charged with maintaining road and street signs.

         (7)  Other    products   and   services   necessary   for   the
    implementation, upgrade, and maintenance of the system and any other
    purpose related to the operation  of  the  system,  including  costs
    attributable  directly  to the construction, leasing, or maintenance
    of any buildings or facilities or costs  of  personnel  attributable
    directly to the operation of the system. Costs attributable directly
    to the operation of an emergency telephone system do not include the
    costs  of  public safety agency personnel who are and equipment that
    is dispatched in response to an emergency call.

    (d)  The board shall complete the data base before implementation of
the 9-1-1 system.  The error ratio of the data base  shall  not  at  any
time exceed 1% of the total data base.

    (Text of Section from P.A. 91-518)
    Sec. 15.6.  Enhanced 9-1-1 service;  business service.

    (a)  After  June  30, 2000, or within 18 months after enhanced 9-1-1
service becomes available,  any  entity  that  installs  or  operates  a
private   business   switch   service  and  provides  telecommunications
facilities or services to businesses shall assure  that  the  system  is
connected to the public switched network in a manner that calls to 9-1-1
result  in  automatic number and location identification.  For buildings
having their own street  address  and  containing  workspace  of  40,000
square   feet   or  less,  location  identification  shall  include  the
building's street address.    For  buildings  having  their  own  street
address  and  containing  workspace  of  more  than  40,000 square feet,
location identification shall include the building's street address  and
one   distinct   location  identification  per  40,000  square  feet  of
workspace. Separate buildings containing workspace of 40,000 square feet
or less having a common public street  address  shall  have  a  distinct
location  identification  for  each  building  in addition to the street
address.

    (b)  Exemptions.  Buildings containing workspace of more than 40,000
square  feet  are  exempt  from  the  multiple  location  identification
requirements of subsection (a) if the building maintains, at all  times,
alternative   and   adequate   means  of  signaling  and  responding  to
emergencies.  Those means shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  a
telephone  system  that  provides  the  physical location of 9-1-1 calls
coming from within the building.  Health care facilities are presumed to
meet the requirements of this paragraph if the  facilities  are  staffed
with medical or nursing personnel 24 hours per day and if an alternative
means  of  providing  information  about the source of an emergency call
exists. Buildings under this exemption must provide 9-1-1  service  that
provides the building's street address.

    Buildings  containing  workspace of more than 40,000 square feet are
exempt from subsection (a) if the  building  maintains,  at  all  times,
alternative   and   adequate   means  of  signaling  and  responding  to
emergencies, including a telephone system that provides the location  of
a  9-1-1  call  coming  from  within  the  building, and the building is
serviced by its own medical, fire  and  security  personnel.   Buildings
under this exemption are subject to emergency phone system certification
by the Illinois Commerce Commission.
    Buildings  in communities not serviced by enhanced 9-1-1 service are
exempt from subsection (a).

    (c)  This Act does not apply to any  PBX  telephone  extension  that
uses  radio  transmissions to convey electrical signals directly between

	Social Engineering:

Government Emergency Telephone Systems biggest flaw is not in its physical 
or watts Band 6 network infrastructure, but the fact that all live operators 
who administrate the GETS system more often than not allow themselves to 
be tricked by unauthorized NON-government employees. Because all calls 
that route through the GETS system are thought of as high-priority, operators
who are called up won't usually think twice about giving the person on the 
other end of the line a high-priority account.

High-priority accounts allow anyone to call any number in most of Canada / 
USA for free. Phone numbers that would normally give you a busy-signal, or 
an "all circuits busy" recording, will allow you to do an Emergency Interrupt
with a GETS account - thus allowing you to break into the conversation between
the called party and the third person on the line.

 Scenario between unauthorized person and GETS operator;

 Operator: "Operator services, how may I help you?"

 John Bashcoff: "Yes, hello this is John Bashcoff with the Office of the 
Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs. I'm in Edmonton right now, and I
seem to have misplaced my GETS pin number. This is an emergency, can you please
supply me with a PIN?"

 Operator: "Yes of course Mr.Bashcoff. The pin number is [12 digit number]."

 John Bashcoff: "Thank You."

 Operator: "You're welcome."

 -- CALL ENDS --

Unauthorized caller proceeds to call back the GETS system, and immediately 
he enters the 12 digit pin he was supplied with. Tada... outdial access
anywhere he wants for free. His caller identification information shows 
'Long Distance, 710-627-4387'. FYI; The area code '710' is a private area 
code owned by the US Government. When you dial up the phone number 710-627-4387,
you will connect to another GETS system.

-

 Dial-Up Numbers -

  I recommend you do not call the first phone number on this list, and when
calling any of these numbers do NOT use them from home or work use a payphone
far away from your home if you can.
  

     * 1-710-627-4387
 
     * 1-800-257-8373
 
     * 1-800-900-GETS

     * 1-888-288-GETS


 -

 Conclusion;

  Have fun and don't get caught. Big brother *IS* watching, and he will 
rip your balls off and flush them down the toilet if he catches you using 
his systems.
