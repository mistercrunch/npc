   Introduction:

  If you've been living under a rock for the past week, you probably have not
  heard about Telus' plan to increase provincial wide residential coverage pricing by 10%.
  Well it's true; less than a year since Telus raised their rates a substantial amount,
  they go ahead and raise them up again... fuckers. In this paper, I am pleading with current
  Telus residential customers to boycott Telus Communications. Telus is a multi-billion dollar
  corporation who has a monopoly over not only the residential and corporate phone lines and
  high-speed Internet ('ADSL') as well. Telus took over BCTEL two years ago, has 25% ownership
  over Sasktel, completely owns Quebectel, has 25% stock in Verizon, and rumour has it they helped
  Nortel Networks (formerly 'Northern Telecom') out of their slump by buying a quantity of their company.
  Holy corporate control, batman!

   Why Boycott Telus?

   A couple weeks ago while I was enjoying my taxi ride home from the Money Mart after pay day, I was lucky
   enough to toon into a local radio station (630 CHED) here in Edmonton where they had an interview
   with the city marketing director for Telus Communications. The Telus employee's defense of the proposal
   for the 10% residential increase was this: "We at Telus want to allow [more] competition into the
   residential market place. By raising the rates, telecom companies who thought that getting into the
   local Alberta market was unprofitable, will now think otherwise. If the proposal goes through, regular
   local residential phone lines will cost, at the most, $35.00 a month." This just does not make any sense!
   Wouldn't raising rates to allow competition be a BAD thing on the part of Telus? If local residential
   competition is allowed in Alberta, then Telus will lose revenue rather quickly. My theory is that the
   Telus employee that was on 630 CHED was full of shit when telling us that raising rates would invite local
   competition. Telus is a very large corporation who's revenues are more important to them than say, quality of
   service (QOS) for Albertans - raising rates will not allow local competition. Telus leases it's own lines to
   local competition in the payphone market at a high cost, and will probably do the same for residential lines.
   And speaking of residential lines, has anyone even seen any other companies in Alberta offering local residential
   service to Albertans? Not I. The only other common carrier I've seen around is AT&T, and they offer business lines.

   The Alternative

The best suited alternative for anyone wanting quality lines at a decent rate, if Telus decides to hike its local rates
to $35.00 for a regular line is - AT&T Business. AT&T right now offers its business accounts for $27.95 per month, and includes
a monthly centrex line, line hunting, call display, call waiting, call conference / transfer and call forwarding. Telus' business
line right now is currently $34.18... what a rip off.

  Conclusion

My conclusion: Telus' service, which was once a flaming pile of dog shit, is now turning into a flaming pile of horse shit.
Go with the alternative, AT&T, if you can... or better yet, get a pre-paid phone from Rogers AT&T or FIDO.
ENDZ.

BOYCOTT TRACFONE


To the victims and to the wise:

 I hear by declare war against TracFone, for crimes committed against the hard
 working people of this nation. Crimes committed are deceit, fraud, and wrongful
 discharge of hard working employees.  This letter is to better prepare you in
 making important decision of purchasing or using TracFone Wireless. This descicion
 could mean the difference between good service and feeling of regret to being had
 by a mayor con. This information is true since I was an employee of this company.
 I know exactly what the truth is and can be proven if needed. This letter will
 contain information about TracFone service and information about the wrongful
 discharges going on inside, like what happened with me. I will start by stating
 how horrible and fraudulent TracFone is. If any of these comments that will follow
 sound familiar, then you know that what I say is true. Analog phones are the main
 products of TracFone, no services are offered other than call out and receive calls.
 You must first call TracFone before use of services can begin. You will have to wait
 no less than 30 minutes before you can receive assistance in programming of phone.
 A competent customer service rep will answer if you are lucky enough. You must endure
 a script read to you which can put a corpse to sleep, which mentions everything you
 must know about TracFone services. That's not always the case though, you might get
 a representative which will give you wrong information since most refuse to know the
 scripts. That is followed by the programming of phone, you do all the work following
 instructions, which plenty of reps don't have the patience for. Multiple lines of
 numbers (code) must be dialed into phone. If that goes through fine, then you have
 a 24 to 48 hour period in which you make test calls to and from your TracFone to see
 if its been activated and can begin using. It's doesn't always happen that way.
 ctivations freeze on the switch, serial numbers have been entered wrong in system,
 and carriers fail to run number through. This means 5 days later your phone is still
 not working. So, there you are holding again for 30 minutes or longer to hear a
 representative tell you he will assist you with the problem. You are asked to put
 more codes into the phone, which only works about 50 % of the time. Your phone still
 does not activate, you are on hold for yet another 10 to 15 minutes while the rep is
 on the other line calling Line Activations (inside dept which calls carrier or doesn't)
 they come back and tell you the phone will be working in 20 minutes if not other scripts
 are 4 to 6 hours, 6 to 8 hours, 24 to 48 hours. Sound familiar? Your phone still not
 working after another 3 days. You are waiting again for 30 minutes or so and you go
 through same steps, codes, holding, codes, holding, 2 to 4 hours they tell you. You are
 issued 10 units for inconvenience, trouble. Sound familiar? Thirty days go by and you want
 a refund of phone and minutes purchased. In store warranty does not apply after 30 days,
 and you find card of minutes which is in your phone is not refundable. Calling TracFone
 and on hold another wonderful 30 minutes or so. You put more codes into phone and finally
 they tell you the phone must be shipped in for repair. You pay shipping and TracFone pays
 return. 3 or 4 weeks later you haven't received your phone and call in for the wonderful
 experience of holding for 30 minutes or so.  Phone has been shipped, they say, many of the
 times it's a lie, they look at screen viewing the case created which contains information
 and what they actually see is that it's still not been started yet. Sound familiar?
 3 months later, you start slightly enjoying your phone until it hits past due. This is even
 more fun for you since it's been 3 boring months since you had the pleasure of calling
 TracFone; you look forward to this. Deactivations of phone for past due or other reasons
 make the activation of the phone virtually impossible, and I still have no idea as to why.
 Customers go through chaos trying to get their phones back up and running again and cannot.
 Customers go online to activate, reactivate, redeem units and all these fail online, which
 forces them to call our wonderful hold line to receive horrible service. Does any of this
 sound familiar to you? Do you think it's pure luck that what I mention here is so familiar
 to your experiences? Makes you think about a lot of things, doesn't it? Well, it's all true.
 I wish it wasn't. But it is. The views of management and other TracFone associates is that
 customers that use and own TracFone are just plain, unimportant people (low lives) which
 cannot for credit, money, age reasons, get regular cellular phone service. These are the hard
 true facts to their thinking.  Why do you think it is so hard to get through right away to a
 customer/tech rep on the phone? So many unhappy customers with phone trouble every single day
 and minute. The calls are overwhelming and I believe, ridiculous that people must endure such
 abuse and horrible service. On a daily basis I was forced into lying to customers if I was
 unable to assist them. And believe me I did my best to help those customers in need of good service.
 y customers were all happy with me and those that called in outrage were satisfied at the end. When
 I lied was because I was told to lie and management down my throat making sure I did just that.
 To all those who have had bad experiences, I apologize. This company is truly amazing and perfect
 example to the fraudulent activities which industry are allowed to get away with in this country,
 especially in Miami. Cheap phones sold at outrageous prices and not to mention the minutes you buy.
 10 minute cards-$7.99, 30 minute cards-$19.99, 100 minutes, with 20 minutes bonus-$49.99, 260 minutes
 with 40 minutes bonus-$99.99, and the new wonderful 1-year plan, 100 minutes and 20 minutes free given
 with every 30 minute card you purchase-$99.99. Do the math and see how cheap and convenient it is to own
 and use one of these phones with all the trouble that it comes with. Rebates are another thing, which makes
 it great to own one. You must first activate your phone, then maintain 90 days of active service (no de-
 activations) to then qualify to receive your rebate, which comes to you within 3 weeks after the 90 days are up.
 If you are lucky, your information was wrong, which led to TracFone sending your rebate to the wrong address.
 Or if you send in rebate and tell a friend promotion, you might be lucky enough to receive 2 rebates with the
 same PIN number, which causes you to wait another 3 to 4 weeks to receive a second PIN to replace the duplicate
 you received accidentally. Sound familiar?  If any company has become successfully wrongfully, this has got to
 be on the top list. This company gets bigger and stronger on feeding off innocent and uniformed consumer.
 This was just the tip of the iceberg ladies and gentlemen. Inside are horrible injustices committed just as
 they do on to the outside. Employment with TracFone is like playing russian rulet with a .357 magnum.
 My story follows.

 TracFone employed me through a job fair in my school. The biggest mistake of my 35 years being alive.
 Let me just say that I am in Miami, Florida, where there are no laws what so ever to protect the employee.
 Florida is one of the few states, which has this and also one of the few states, which allows fraudulent
 companies to greatly succeed. Nine months I was employed at TracFone and have seen enough to say that there
 is something wrong with the US if such companies are allowed to exist. TracFone wrongfully discharged me and
 I have tried to send in proof to them, which Debra McCollough (Head of HR dept) told I that if I were to prove
 my innocence I would get my job back. This incompetent woman decided not to do what was promised to me and decided
 to keep me terminated not to tarnish her wrongful professional judgement. I was just given an opportunity to a new
 position on the 18th of Aug and on the 21st of Aug I was walked to Debra McColloughs office where call center director
 May Del Oro, call center manager Maribel and head of security awaited me. Debra confronted me with greetings and
 offering of her hand for shacking. Followed by straight accusation of me posting a letter at complaints.com, which
 talked bad about the company and also mentioned a happening at TracFone where they failed to pay me for 4 months backpay.
 I argued I did not post such and she insisted I e-mailed this to complaints.com. I was accused, convicted and tagged as
 guilty with no chance of me defending myself. Head of security to collect my things immediately escorted me and then
 escorted out in front of all my co-workers (friends) to the bldg. exit like I were a criminal, murderer, rapist.
 This was, needless to say, humiliating, devastating and wrong. This is common practice at TracFone, even Sonia Sinclair,
 call center manager, who resigned was escorted like a convict walking death row to her execution. What does this say about
 this company or others that practice it? I send all my proof including numbers, address and name of CEO of complaints.com
 ho found no record of me posting or my e-mail address in his database as a poster user and still they keep me out.
 There was no investigation to my accusation, which simply demonstrated my innocence. There was no post at complaints.com,
 which is the easiest fact to acquire to show my innocence and still I get labeled, accused and convicted wrongfully by
 Debra McCollough. I expected more from Debra McCollough, her being a career woman and an Afro-American at that.
 Two of the most persecuted, targeted and discriminated minorities in history. After all that women and Afro-Americans
 have fought so hard to accomplish this woman slaps them all in the face. All those who have been incarcerated, killed
 and tortured in history to make sure Debra McCollough got to where she is at right this moment.  I have feelings,
 financial needs and future plans to achieve and this has set me back years. This does not cross her mind since Debra
 McCollough rather look good in her descicion rather than do the right thing and admit to the wrongful doing which was
 committed against me. The document I was accused of posting at this site was falsified which I easily proved with
 documents I sent to be presented in my defense. All of this was ignored and put aside to keep this woman in the light.  

 Now, I ask you all this question. How are we going to stop these horrible actions from continuing or surfacing?
 One easy way is the oldest and most powerful ever used. That is to practice BOYCOTTING. Hurting them the only way it
 really does hurt and damage their ways of life. Money, the root of all evil. My advice to you all is to join others
 and me in the same position, victims of these horrible actions committed to the hard working people of America. The people. 
 Right to protest freedom of speech, freedom of expression. Civil rights cannot be ignored; we the people must fight for what
 thousands have died for in making sure we have. They have fought for our rights, right to live, right to succeed, and right
 to pursue happiness. Join me in this quest to achieve what industries like TracFone believe we would fail at. Join me in
 making a difference. Join me in making sure the truth be heard. 

 BOYCOTT TRACFONE WITH ME, WITH US. LET'S MAKE A DIFFERENCE 

 Thank you,
 
 Nestor L Rodriguez
 (Ex TracFone employee)
