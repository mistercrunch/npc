	  [CRTC Introduction: issue 0, volume 1 - August 2001]

	     On August 26, 2001 the world changed forever...

a group of anti-socials with extraordinary telephone skills got together
and flaunted their fresh writings into an online compilation magazine.
They called it 'CRTC' (Call and Response Telephone Compilations). Within the
digital pages of this magazine, hold insightful information regarding the complex
telephone systems of Canada. The group known as the Canadian Phreakers Union
not only created, but write for CRTC regularly. CRTC issues are released on the
11th day of every month and contain 100% telephony related information -  'cause
everything else is boring and irrelevant. Join the Canadian Phreakers Union's
journey through Mah Bell's copper veins, and enter the world of the phone 
phreaks in Call and Response Telephone Compilations.
