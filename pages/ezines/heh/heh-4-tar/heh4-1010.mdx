HironiK
    
    A young hacka turned sixteen
    He made a trojan, and segfaulted next day
    It's a bigbug into your source code
    It's a damn API that do not compile
    And isn't it HironiK...dontcha think
    
    It's like great lag on your hacking day
    It's a free shell when you've already paid
    It's the good compiler that you just didn't take
    Who would've thought...it figures
    
    Mr. hell It Safe was afraid to hack
    He turnedon his pc and waited the logon
    He waited his whole damn life to take that hack
    And his kernel crashed down he thought
    Well isn't this nice...
    And isn't it HironiK...dontcha think
    
    It's like the lost lib that you just need
    It's a broadcast address, when you're playing Quake
    It's the good exploit that you just didn't known
    Who would've thought...it figures
    
    Well admins has a funny way of snifing up on you 
    When you think your are not logued and and you are not traced
    And life has a funny way of detecting you out when
    You think they gotcha, and you are completely right
    someone is knocking at you
    
    A packet jam when you're already discovered 
    A no-hacking sign on your intruding break
    It's like ten thousand shells when all you need is a root
    It's getting the UID of my dreams
    And then meeting his beautiful ipchains
    And isn't it HironiK...dontcha think
    A little too HironiK...and yeah I really do think...
    
    It's like ten frag left on your championship day
    It's a god Mode, when you're playing alone
    It's the good medikit that you just didn't take
    Who would've thought...it figures
    
    Quaker has a funny way of calling at you
    Quaker has a funny, funny way of getting you out
    Insulting you out
