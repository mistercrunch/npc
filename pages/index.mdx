Hacking. Phreaking. Virii. Anarchy. Cracking.

Textfiles from the computer underground, preserved for the modern web.

## What is this?

Before the web, there were **BBSes** (Bulletin Board Systems). And on those BBSes, the underground distributed **ezines** — text files covering everything from phone phreaking to virus writing to social engineering.

These documents are primary sources of early internet culture. Most exist only as `.zip` files in forgotten FTP archives. We're converting them to searchable, readable web pages.

- [**40Hex**](/ezines/40hex) — Virus writing zine by Phalcon/Skism (1991-1998)
- [**Phrack**](/ezines/phrack) — The legendary hacker zine (1985-2016)

## The Mission

Make the underground accessible. These zines shaped hacker culture, security research, and internet history. They shouldn't rot in `.tar.gz` files that nobody opens.
